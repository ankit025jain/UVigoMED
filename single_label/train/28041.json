{"id":28041,"title":"[The frequency of performing smoking cessation outpatient clinic in chest disease specialists who are members of Turkish Thoracic Society and factors affecting this performance].","abstract":"Although helping patients to stop smoking is a good clinical practice that has to be carried out by physicians everywhere and in every area, it is known that carrying out this help systematically in accordance to a programme in smoking cessation outpatient clinics significantly improves the chance of success.The study is a cross-sectional survey performed among chest disease specialists who are members of Turkish Thoracic Society (TTS), between June 2010 and February 2011. As independent variables relevant to status of performing/not performing Smoking Cessation Outpatient Clinic (SCOC); sex, age (younger or older than 40), being graduated before or after 1996, being or not being in a consultant position, work place (Hospital of Ministry of Health/private hospital/university hospital), having or not having an education for smoking cessation help and being or not being member of a City Tobacco Control Committee (CTCC) were investigated. Data was collected via a web-questionnaire prepared by using WHO Global Health Professionals Questionnaire which was sent to members through TTS secreteriat.41% (699/1701) of members of TTS responded. 39.5% of responders reported that they perform SCOC. When the factors possibly affecting the performance of SCOC are evaluated with logistic regression analysis; being graduated after 1996, having an education for smoking cessation help, being a member of CTCC and not being an active smoker are found to improve this performance.Our study showed that having an education for smoking cessation help (and tobacco control) makes chest disease specialists get more responsibility on this topic. Accordingly, continuous efforts for improving awareness of personal and social responsibilities of all physicians, especially chest disease specialists, have to be made to provide their taking active roles in tobacco control.","date":"2014-07-20","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038382","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.632087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.62321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.579805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.563854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.447709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.398546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.229955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Good Clinical Practice","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Clinical_Practice"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Global health","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Tobacco control","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_control"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Social responsibility","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_responsibility"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"2010 Winter Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics"},{"name":"1996","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
