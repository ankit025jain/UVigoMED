{"id":56130,"title":"Neurotrophic corneal ulceration after retinal detachment surgery with retinectomy and endolaser: a case series.","abstract":"Trigeminal nerve lesions at differing levels can result in complete or partial corneal anesthesia and ensuing epithelial breakdown. Disease progression can lead to corneal ulceration, melt, and perforation. To our knowledge, neurotrophic corneal ulceration has not previously been reported after retinal detachment surgery and argon endolaser.Herein, we report a series of 5 cases of patients without diabetes who developed neuropathic corneal ulceration presumed secondary to long ciliary nerve compromise. This occurred within 5 to 10 weeks following vitrectomy surgery with endolaser and silicone oil tamponade for retinal detachment.Clinicians should be mindful of the long ciliary nerves intraoperatively and, where possible, avoid heavy confluent treatment at these sites without compromising the need for adequate retinopexy. Where corneal anesthesia occurs, it is important to recognize this early and treat promptly to minimize the risk for ulceration and visual loss.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743924","annotations":[{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.792902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.778848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.770054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Trigeminal nerve","weight":0.623122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_nerve"},{"name":"Vision loss","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.603424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Corneal ulcer","weight":0.52551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_ulcer"},{"name":"Cilium","weight":0.425037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium"},{"name":"Argon","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.391529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.387411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.256577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Neurotrophin","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotrophin"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Long ciliary nerves","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_ciliary_nerves"},{"name":"Silicone oil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone_oil"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Melting point","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"}]}
