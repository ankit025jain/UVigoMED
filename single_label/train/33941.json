{"id":33941,"title":"Influence of a two-year steroid treatment on body composition as measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.","abstract":"Steroids are nowadays routinely used as a long-term treatment in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Their effects on body composition were assessed using dual X-ray absorptiometry. The study followed over 2 years 29 genetically confirmed DMD patients: 21 in the steroid-treated group and 8 in the steroid-naïve group. After 2 years of steroid treatment, the lean tissue mass values increased significantly (p<0.0001), the percentage of body fat mass remained practically constant (p=0.94) in comparison with the initial visit. In the steroid-naïve patients, there were no significant increases in the lean tissue mass but deterioration in body composition confirmed by a significant increase in the percentage of body fat mass. Besides, significant negative correlations were found between the percentage of body fat mass and the MFM total score (R=-0.79, n=76, p<0.0001). A 2-year steroid treatment improves significantly body composition of boys with DMD through a significant increase in lean tissue mass. We suggest that a thorough check of body composition should be carried out before steroid treatment discontinuation in case of overweight gain.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780149","annotations":[{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.806856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Muscular dystrophy","weight":0.725844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy","weight":0.453355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Body fat percentage","weight":0.37774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.35573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.281782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Modified Frequency Modulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Frequency_Modulation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 2","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_2"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
