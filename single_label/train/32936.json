{"id":32936,"title":"Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery presenting as dilated cardiomyopathy: a case report.","abstract":"Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is a rare congenital anomaly and one of the causes of myocardial ischemia. The usual clinical course is severe left-sided heart failure and mitral valve insufficiency presenting during the first months of life.We report the case of a 6-month-old Tunisian girl who presented with dilated cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography suspected anomalous origin of the left coronary artery. The definitive diagnosis of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery was reached by multislice computed tomography and coronary angiography.In cases of dilated cardiomyopathy, anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery syndrome has to be kept in mind as a surgically correctable cause.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885797","annotations":[{"name":"Dilated cardiomyopathy","weight":0.865084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilated_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Mitral regurgitation","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_regurgitation"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Left coronary artery","weight":0.780462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Coronary catheterization","weight":0.755469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_catheterization"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.743415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.705309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Myocardial ischemia","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_ischemia"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"}]}
