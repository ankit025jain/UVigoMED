{"id":45237,"title":"[Two cases of acute large bowel obstruction caused by advanced cancer treated with stenting \"bridge to surgery\" procedure].","abstract":"Obstructive colorectal cancer accounts for 3.1-15.8% of total colorectal cancer cases, therefore it is not a rare condition. Formerly, it has been often treated with emergent operation such as colostomy or trans-anal tube decompression. Since 2012, revision of the medical payment system, it has become possible to be treated with elective operation when using endoscopic metal stent placement that enable to decompress enlarged intestine by transanal approach. This procedure provides safe elective surgery with sufficient preoperative inspection and conventional bowel preparation. We report two cases of acute large bowel obstruction due to colon cancer treated with endoscopic stent placement as a \"bridge to surgery\".","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693688","annotations":[{"name":"Colostomy","weight":0.860214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colostomy"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.775896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.707851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Colon cleansing","weight":0.443838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_cleansing"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Medical billing (United States)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_billing_(United_States)"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"Decompression party","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_party"},{"name":"Inspection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspection"},{"name":"Payment system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_system"},{"name":"Elective surgery","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_surgery"},{"name":"Historical revisionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Payment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment"}]}
