{"id":40783,"title":"[Correlation of the level of Reg3? protein in plasma with gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease].","abstract":"This study was purposed to explore the correlation of regenerating Islet-derived 3-alpha(Reg3?) protein level in plasma with the diagnosis and prognosis of the gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease (GI-aGVHD) after all-HSCT, 103 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) were observed in our hospital from December 2011 to December 2012. Peripheral blood samples were routinely collected at 9 d before allo-HSCT, 0 d, 14 d, 28 d after allo-HSCT as well as in aGVHD and at the 1 and 4 weeks after aGVHD therapy. The plasma concentrations of Reg3? were measured by using ELISA kit. The results indicated that among the 103 patients, 17 cases never developed aGVHD symptoms (no-aGVHD), 27 cases presented with non-aGVHD associated diarrhea, 10 cases presented with isolated skin aGVHD, 17 cases developed grades I-II GI-aGVHD, 32 cases with grades III-IV GI-aGVHD. The plasma concentrations of Reg3? in group of patients with GI-aGVHD and group of non-aGVHD diarrhea were 111.5 (54.7-180.2) and 23.9 (14.5-89.5) ng/ml respectively with significant difference (P < 0.001). The plasma concentrations of Reg3? in 17 patients of grades III-IV GI-aGVHD who experienced a complete or partial response and 7 patients who had no response to therapy at 4 weeks were 137.2(51.7-205.4) and 679.4(122.3-896.8) ng/ml respectively with the significant difference (P = 0.028). All of the patients who had no response to therapy died of aGVHD associated multiple organ failure. The area under the ROC curve was 0.902 when plasma concentration of Reg3? was set at 87.73 ng/ml. The sensitivity was 81.48% and the specificity was 82.86% when the critical value was used in diagnosis of grades III-IV GI-aGVHD. The probability of grades III-IV GI-aGVHD had statistical difference above and below 87.73 ng/ml after allo-HSCT (P < 0.001). It is concluded that the increase of plasma Reg3? level after transplantation suggests the incidence of grades III-IV GI-aGVHD. The high level of plasma Reg3? protein in patients with grades III-IV GI-aGVHD after the immunosuppressive treatment for four weeks indicates a poor prognosis. The plasma concentrations of Reg3? can be used as a specific biomarker of GI-aGVHD.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24989295","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.761812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","weight":0.714856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.69774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.670183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.4655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.438413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.31704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.127428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Organ failure","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_failure"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"}]}
