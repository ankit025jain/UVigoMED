{"id":2209,"title":"Evaluation of the relationship between serum ghrelin, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels, and disease activity in inflammatory bowel diseases.","abstract":"Ghrelin is a 28 aminoasid peptide hormone, have generally focused upon this peptide’s role upon growth and energy metabolism. Recently, studies investigating ghrelin’s effect upon inflammation and immune response have gained importance. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of ghrelin levels, Creactive protein and interleukin-6 levels in establishing disease activity.52 cases with ulcerative colitis and 33 with Crohn’s disease, total 85 patients, were included in this study. The serum ghrelin levels of the patients in remission and of those with active disease were compared.The mean serum ghrelin level in active patients (1243 ± 648 pg/ml), was found to be higher than those in remission (466 ± 214 pg/ml) (p<0.001). In establishing the disease activity, CRP is a the most effective marker compared to the other two inflammatory markers. AUC values were established as; CRP: 0.947 (95% CI,0.903-0.992),ghrelin:0.934(95% CI, 0.884-0.984) and interleukin-6: 0.756 (95% CI, 0.648- 0.864).Serum ghrelin level can be used with CRP as an important marker in establishing the mucosal damage in inflammatory bowel diseases.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25436282","annotations":[{"name":"Ghrelin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghrelin"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.814388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Peptide hormone","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_hormone"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.786959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.711665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.678359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.492394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.402013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bioenergetics","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergetics"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
