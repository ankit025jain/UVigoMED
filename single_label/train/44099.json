{"id":44099,"title":"Detection of colorectal adenoma by narrow band imaging (HQ190) vs. high-definition white light colonoscopy: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"The benefits of narrow band imaging (NBI) on enhancing colorectal adenoma detection remain questionable. We tested whether the new generation of NBI (190-NBI), which is twice as bright as the previous version, would improve adenoma detection when compared with high-definition white light (HD-WL) colonoscopy.It was a randomized controlled trial with tandem colonoscopy. We recruited patients who underwent colonoscopy for symptoms, screening, or surveillance. Patients were randomized for the use of either 190-NBI or HD-WL on withdrawal. Tandem colonoscopy was performed by using the same assigned colonoscope and withdrawal method. Lesions detected on first-pass and second-pass examination were used for adenoma detection and miss rates, respectively. The primary outcomes were adenoma and polyp detection rates.A total of 360 patients were randomized to undergo either 190-NBI or HD-WL colonoscopy. Both the adenoma and polyp detection rates were significantly higher in the 190-NBI group compared with the HD-WL group (adenoma: 48.3% vs. 34.4%, P=0.01; polyps: 61.1% vs. 48.3%, P=0.02). The mean number of polyps detected per patient was higher in the 190-NBI group (1.49% vs. 1.13, P=0.07). There was no significant difference in the adenoma miss rates between the two groups (21.8% vs. 21.2%). Multivariate analysis showed that the use of 190-NBI (odds ratio (OR) 1.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-3.12), withdrawal time (OR 1.29; CI 1.19-1.38), patient's age (OR 1.04; CI 1.01-1.06), and male gender (OR 2.38; CI 1.42-3.99) were associated with adenoma detection.190-NBI colonoscopy was superior to the conventional HD-WL in detecting colorectal adenomas or polyps, but there was no significant difference in adenoma miss rates.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751581","annotations":[{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.910624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.850716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.481792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.330998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.263318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.22573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.198984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.170908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Polyp","weight":0.0322457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Coitus interruptus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coitus_interruptus"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.0207178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Grammatical gender","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1 metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_metre"},{"name":"423","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/423"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Tandem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
