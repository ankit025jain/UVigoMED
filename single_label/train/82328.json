{"id":82328,"title":"Peri-implantitis: etiology, diagnosis and treatment: an update.","abstract":"Peri-implant mucositis is described as the presence of inflammation in the mucosa around implants without any bone loss. By contrast, in peri-implantitis, besides the inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa, loss of supporting bone is also seen. The probing depth, the presence of bleeding on probing, suppuration and radiographs should be assessed regularly for the diagnosis of peri-implant diseases. Poor oral hygiene, smoking and previous history of periodontitis are known risk factors for the disease. The occlusion and longevity of fixed partial dentures around implants, whether connected to the natural teeth or not, is still an area of investigaton, but studies show that long-term results are acceptable for both. Various treatment modalities are discussed in relation to the management of periimplantitis. The predictable outcome of peri-implantitis management is not yet known.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654366","annotations":[{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.530897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.509428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.4546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.252291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.249696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Longevity","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity"},{"name":"Removable partial denture","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removable_partial_denture"},{"name":"Mucositis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucositis"},{"name":"Bleeding on probing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_on_probing"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
