{"id":82623,"title":"Effect of cytokines on osteoclast formation and bone resorption during mechanical force loading of the periodontal membrane.","abstract":"Mechanical force loading exerts important effects on the skeleton by controlling bone mass and strength. Several in vivo experimental models evaluating the effects of mechanical loading on bone metabolism have been reported. Orthodontic tooth movement is a useful model for understanding the mechanism of bone remodeling induced by mechanical loading. In a mouse model of orthodontic tooth movement, TNF-? was expressed and osteoclasts appeared on the compressed side of the periodontal ligament. In TNF-receptor-deficient mice, there was less tooth movement and osteoclast numbers were lower than in wild-type mice. These results suggest that osteoclast formation and bone resorption caused by loading forces on the periodontal ligament depend on TNF-?. Several cytokines are expressed in the periodontal ligament during orthodontic tooth movement. Studies have found that inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-? strongly inhibit osteoclast formation and tooth movement. Blocking macrophage colony-stimulating factor by using anti-c-Fms antibody also inhibited osteoclast formation and tooth movement. In this review we describe and discuss the effect of cytokines in the periodontal ligament on osteoclast formation and bone resorption during mechanical force loading.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574904","annotations":[{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.90973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Periodontal fiber","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_fiber"},{"name":"Osteoclast","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoclast"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.776326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.691491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.597475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.563926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.536155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.476424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.40585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.254458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.216096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.150191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
