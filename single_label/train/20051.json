{"id":20051,"title":"Parvimonas micra as a causative organism of spondylodiscitis: a report of two cases and a literature review.","abstract":"Spondylodiscitis caused by Parvimonas micra, a rarely reported infection, might be under-detected using conventional methods. This report of the detection and treatment of two cases of spondylodiscitis due to P. micra and review of the literature indicates that the use of gene sequencing methods might improve the accuracy of diagnosing this infection.
