{"id":69066,"title":"Association of morning and evening blood pressure at home with asymptomatic organ damage in the J-HOP Study.","abstract":"Several guidelines recommend that home blood pressure (HBP) be measured both in the morning and in the evening. However, there have been fewer reports about the clinical significance of morning HBP than about the clinical significance of evening HBP.Our study included 4,310 patients recruited for the Japan Morning Surge Home Blood Pressure Study who had one or more cardiovascular risk factors. We measured morning and evening HBP, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), left ventricular mass index (LVMI), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), maximum carotid intima media thickness (IMT), N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (Hs-cTnT).The correlation coefficients for the associations between morning systolic BP (SBP) and log-transformed baPWV, NT-proBNP, or Hs-cTnT were significantly greater than the corresponding relationships for evening SBP (all P < 0.01). The goodness-of-fit of the associations between morning home SBP and UACR (P < 0.05) or baPWV (P < 0.01) was improved by adding evening home SBP to the SBP measurement. In contrast, the goodness-of-fit values of the associations between evening SBP and UACR (P < 0.001), LVMI (P < 0.05), baPWV (P < 0.001), NT-proBNP (P < 0.001), and Hs-cTnT (P < 0.001) were improved by adding morning home SBP to the SBP measurement.Morning BP and evening BP provide equally useful information for subclinical target organ damage, yet multivariate modeling highlighted the stand-alone predictive ability of morning BP.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473255","annotations":[{"name":"Troponin","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.799947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.656323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.614056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.592152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Tunica intima","weight":0.581475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunica_intima"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.575092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.557844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.54204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.459703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.322107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.319691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
