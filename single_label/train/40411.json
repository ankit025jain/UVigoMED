{"id":40411,"title":"PPAR?-dependent exacerbation of experimental colitis by the hypolipidemic drug fenofibrate.","abstract":"Fibrates, such as fenofibrate, are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR?) agonists and have been used for several decades as hypolipidemic agents in the clinic. However, contradictory observations exist on the role of fibrates in host response to acute inflammation, with unclear mechanisms. The role of PPAR? in colitis was assessed using fenofibrate and Ppara-null mice. Wild-type or Ppara-null mice were subjected to acute colitis under three distinct protocols, dextran sulfate sodium, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, and Salmonella Typhi. Serum and colon lipidomics were analyzed to characterize the metabolic profiles by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Messenger RNAs of PPAR? target genes and genes involved in inflammation were determined by qunatitative PCR analysis. Fenofibrate treatment exacerbated inflammation and tissue injury in acute colitis, and this was dependent on PPAR? activation. Lipidomics analysis revealed that bioactive sphingolipids, including sphingomyelins (SM) and ceramides, were significantly increased in the colitis group compared with the control group; this was further potentiated following fenofibrate treatment. In the colon, fenofibrate did not reduce the markedly increased expression of mRNA encoding TNF? found in the acute colitis model, while it decreased hydrolysis and increased synthesis of SM, upregulated RIPK3-dependent necrosis, and elevated mitochondrial fatty acid ?-oxidation, which were possibly related to the exacerbated colitis.
