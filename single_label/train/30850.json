{"id":30850,"title":"Production of monoclonal antibody for okadaic acid and its utilization in an ultrasensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and one-step immunochromatographic strip.","abstract":"Okadaic acid (OA) is a common marine biotoxin that accumulates in bivalves and causes diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP). This study generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to OA from a hybridoma cell line, 6B1A3, which was obtained by fusion of myeloma cells (P3/NS1/1-AG4-1) with spleen cells isolated from a BALB/c mouse immunized with OA-?-globulin. The 6B1A3 mAb belongs to the immunoglobulin G1 (? chain) isotype. Both competitive direct and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were established for characterization of the antibody. The concentrations causing 50% inhibition of binding of OA-horseradish peroxidase to the antibody by OA were calculated to be 0.077 ng/mL in the cdELISA. A rapid and sensitive mAb-based gold nanoparticle immunochromatographic strip was also established. This proposed strip has a detection limit of 5 ng/mL for OA and can be finished in 10 min. Extensive analyses of 20 seafood samples with ELISA revealed that 10 were slightly contaminated with OA, with a mean concentration of 0.892 ng/g. Analysis of OA in shellfish samples showed that data acquired by the immunochromatographic strip agreed well with those acquired by the ELISA. The mAb-based ELISA and immunochromatographic strip assay developed in this study have adequate sensitivity and accuracy for rapid screening of OA in shellfish samples.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446876","annotations":[{"name":"Hybridoma technology","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridoma_technology"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.691293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.585621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.571178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.53479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Shellfish","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellfish"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.341032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Isotype (immunology)","weight":0.292697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotype_(immunology)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.182225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colloidal gold","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloidal_gold"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"G1 phase","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1_phase"},{"name":"Bivalvia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivalvia"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Seafood","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"}]}
