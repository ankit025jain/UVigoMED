{"id":44654,"title":"Polyacrylamide-based biocompatible Nanoplatform enhances the tumor uptake, PET/fluorescence imaging and anticancer activity of a chlorophyll analog.","abstract":"In this report we demonstrate the outstanding advantages of multifunctional nanoplatforms for cancer-imaging and therapy. The non-toxic polyacrylamide (PAA) nanoparticles (size:18-25 nm) formulation drastically changed the pharmacokinetic profile of the ¹²?I- labeled chlorophyll-a derivative (formulated in 10% ethanol in PBS) with a remarkable enhancement in tumor uptake, and significantly reduced uptake in spleen and liver. Among the various nanoformulations investigated, the ¹²?I- labeled photosensitizer (dose: 0.6142 MBq), and the cyanine dye-nanoparticles (CD-NP) conjugate (dose 0.3 ?mol/kg) in combination showed great potential for tumor imaging (PET/NIR fluorescence) in BALB/c mice bearing Colon26 tumors. Compared to free non-labeled photosensitizer, the corresponding PAA nanoformulation under similar treatment parameters showed a remarkable enhancement in long-term tumor cure by PDT (photodynamic therapy) and provides an opportunity to develop a single nanoplatform for tumor-imaging (PET/fluorescence) and phototherapy, a practical \"See and Treat\" approach.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24723983","annotations":[{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Chlorophyll","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.765532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Light therapy","weight":0.722455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.660502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.621206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.585058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.459055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Photosensitizer","weight":0.310344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitizer"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Becquerel","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becquerel"},{"name":"Pacific Time Zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone"},{"name":"Cyanine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanine"},{"name":"Public Broadcasting Service","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service"},{"name":"Polyacrylamide","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyacrylamide"},{"name":"Biocompatibility","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocompatibility"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"1825","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1825"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Multifunction printer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifunction_printer"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Treat (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treat_(band)"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"}]}
