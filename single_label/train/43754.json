{"id":43754,"title":"Interleukin-10 gene promoter polymorphisms in celiac patients from north-eastern Italy.","abstract":"Celiac disease is a complex chronic intestinal disorder driven by an immune response against the gliadin fraction of gluten: many factors are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, and among these Interleukin-10 could play an important role. In the present study, the -1082A>G, -819T>C and -592A>C IL10 functional polymorphisms were analyzed in 565 celiac patients and 576 healthy controls from north-eastern Italy, stratified for HLA class II celiac disease risk haplotypes. No significant differences were observed for the three IL10 polymorphisms distribution between celiac patients and controls with the exception of a slightly increased risk for the -1082A allele in HLA-DQ8 male individuals. Although our findings suggest that the IL10 genetic variants analyzed do not have a major role in the susceptibility to the development of celiac disease in north-eastern Italian patients, we think that the possible involvement of IL10 gene in CD should deserve further investigation and that large-scale studies are recommended to confirm our findings.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768947","annotations":[{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gluten","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Gliadin","weight":0.790996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliadin"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.707117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.661871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.620804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.560335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.444757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.39827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Diverticulitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulitis"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
