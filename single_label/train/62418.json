{"id":62418,"title":"Detection of monoclonal IGH rearrangements in circulating cells from healthy first-degree relatives of patients with multiple myeloma.","abstract":"Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by abnormal proliferation of clonal plasma cells or monoclonal plasmacytosis, resulting in accumulation of clonal immunoglobulins. Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) is considered a premorbid stage for developing MM. Studies have shown an increased risk of MGUS in first-degree relatives of patients with MM. Detection of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) rearrangement provides a useful tool for assessing clonality. The aim of this study was to determine clonality in peripheral blood samples from 61 healthy first-degree relatives of MM probands by sorting circulating lymphocytes and detection of the IGH rearrangements in these cells. We detected 16 out of 61 (26.2%) relatives with monoclonal complete and incomplete IGH rearrangements; only three of them showed elevated monoclonal immunoglobulin in the serum protein electrophoresis. We conclude that this strategy is able to identify efficiently clonality in peripheral blood samples from first-degree relatives of patients with MM, who have a non-negligible risk of developing MGUS or other plasma cell dyscrasias.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24577939","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Serum protein electrophoresis","weight":0.905328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_protein_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Protein electrophoresis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.798415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Gamma globulin","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_globulin"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.731015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.725335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Heavy chain","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_chain"},{"name":"IGH@","weight":0.610832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGH@"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.599889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.599351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin heavy chain","weight":0.518573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_heavy_chain"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.474854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.295474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy","weight":0.270616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy_of_undetermined_significance"},{"name":"Proband","weight":0.065098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proband"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.0323784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Assortative mating","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assortative_mating"}]}
