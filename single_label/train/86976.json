{"id":86976,"title":"[Research progress in receptors involved in rotavirus infection].","abstract":"Rotaviruses, which are recognized as one of the major etiological agents among infants and young children with diarrhea, consist of three concentric layers of protein capsid with the enclosed double-stranded RNA genome. Rotaviruses infect host cells mainly by identifying the specific receptors on cell surfaces and binding to them. Therefore, receptors are important factors for viruses infecting cells. So far, there have been many receptors found to be involved in rotavirus infection, including sialic acid, integrin, Toll-like receptor, and blood group antigen. This article provides an overview of receptors involved in rotavirus infection.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25118387","annotations":[{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Rotavirus","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus"},{"name":"Capsid","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsid"},{"name":"Sialic acid","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sialic_acid"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"RNA virus","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Blood type","weight":0.479789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"}]}
