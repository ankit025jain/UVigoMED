{"id":59385,"title":"Liarozole inhibits transforming growth factor-?3--mediated extracellular matrix formation in human three-dimensional leiomyoma cultures.","abstract":"To investigate the impact of liarozole on transforming growth factor-?3 (TGF-?3) expression, TGF-?3 controlled profibrotic cytokines, and extracellular matrix formation in a three-dimensional (3D) leiomyoma model system.Molecular and immunohistochemical analysis in a cell line evaluated in a three-dimensional culture.Laboratory study.None.Treatment of leiomyoma and myometrial cells with liarozole and TGF-?3 in a three-dimensional culture system.Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to assess fold gene and protein expression of TGF-?3 and TGF-?3 regulated fibrotic cytokines: collagen 1A1 (COL1A1), fibronectin, and versican before and after treatment with liarozole, and confirmatory immunohistochemical stains of treated three-dimensional cultures.Both TGF-?3 gene and protein expression were elevated in leiomyoma cells compared with myometrium in two-dimensional and 3D cultures. Treatment with liarozole decreased TGF-?3 gene and protein expression. Extracellular matrix components versican, COL1A1, and fibronectin were also decreased by liarozole treatment in 3D cultures. Treatment of 3D cultures with TGF-?3 increased gene expression and protein production of COL1A1, fibronectin, and versican.Liarozole decreased TGF-?3 and TGF-?3-mediated extracellular matrix expression in a 3D uterine leiomyoma culture system.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy
