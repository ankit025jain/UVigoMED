{"id":86412,"title":"MicroRNA-152 targets ADAM17 to suppress NSCLC progression.","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that have been suggested to play an essential role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we show that miR-152 is significantly downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cell lines. Restoration of miR-152 significantly reduces proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. In addition, ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) is identified as a target of miR-152 in NSCLC cells, and miR-152-induced suppression of cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion is partially mediated by silencing of ADAM17 expression. Furthermore, ADAM17 inversely correlates with miR-152 in NSCLC tissues. Collectively, our findings indicate that miR-152 acts as tumor suppressor in NSCLC partially via targeting ADAM17.
