{"id":89591,"title":"[Fracture of the carpal scaphoid in children. Case report and literature review].","abstract":"To conduct a bibliographic review of the infrequent fractures of the carpal scaphoid in pediatric cases based on a clinical case. The diagnosis is usually a difficult one and treatment should be stringent in order to minimize the chance of delayed healing or pseudoarthrosis.Ten year-old child with a carpal scaphoid fracture visible in the plain films. The patient did not comply with treatment and removed the cast at three weeks. Despite this healing occurred without any clinical sequelae.This case is especially infrequent given the excellent result obtained despite the fact that the immobilization period was considerably shorter than the minimum recommended.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701776","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.11105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Scaphoid bone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaphoid_bone"},{"name":"Pseudarthrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudarthrosis"},{"name":"Scaphoid fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaphoid_fracture"},{"name":"Plain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Bibliography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliography"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Orthopedic cast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_cast"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
