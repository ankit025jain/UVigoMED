{"id":86722,"title":"Comparison of simultaneous bilateral with unilateral total knee arthroplasty.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (BTKA) and unilateral total knee arthroplasty (UTKA) in terms of morbidity, clinical and radiological findings and quality of life.The study included 48 simultaneous BTKAs (46 females, 2 males; mean age: 64.00 ± 8.31 years) and 53 UTKAs (46 females, 7 males; mean age: 64.40 ± 7.45 years) performed between November 2007 and June 2012. Groups were compared with respect to comorbidity, complications, blood transfusion, hospital stay, clinical and radiological (American Knee Society Score) findings and quality of life (SF-36).Three patients in the BTKA group and 1 in the UTKA group required intensive care admission due to pulmonary embolism; 2 cases occurred within the first postoperative 30 days. One BTKA patient died in the early postoperative period and 1 patient from the BTKA and 1 from the UTKA group died within 1 year. Hospital stay, perioperative blood transfusion parameters and mortality rates were significantly different in favor of UTKA and revision operation rates in favor of BTKA (p<0.05). All patients had improved knee and function scores and SF-36 scores. However, there was no significant difference between the groups (p>0.05).Simultaneous BTKA should be considered in selected patients under 70 years of age with good compliance and no comorbid disease.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747618","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.752311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.632844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.581051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.388231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.335411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.301652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.165223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0504415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Editing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
