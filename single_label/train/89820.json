{"id":89820,"title":"Dual-incision approach for repair of peroneal tendon dislocation associated with fractures of the calcaneus.","abstract":"Dislocation of the peroneal tendons associated with calcaneus fractures should be repaired during fracture fixation to prevent complications. The only documented approach for repair is by proximal extension of the vertical limb of the lateral extensile approach to the calcaneus. However, enlarging the inherently fragile calcaneus flap places it at further risk of damage. Using a separate anterior incision to repair the dislocation, thus avoiding problems caused by excessive flap elevation, seemed intuitive. This approach proved technically effective and reliable in producing favorable outcomes in a series of 14 patients.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679190","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.764484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.746945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.585337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.459079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Calcaneus","weight":0.336111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcaneus"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.149479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.114162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.0821511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0484734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Peroneus longus","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroneus_longus"},{"name":"Intuition (knowledge)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_(knowledge)"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"}]}
