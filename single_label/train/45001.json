{"id":45001,"title":"Telaprevir with peginterferon/ribavirin for retreatment of null responders with advanced fibrosis post-orthotopic liver transplant.","abstract":"Aggressive recurrence of hepatitis C remains problematic post-orthotopic liver transplant (OLT). There are limited data on treatment of HCV infection with telaprevir/boceprevir therapy with peginterferon/ribavirin (PR) post-OLT.To review our experience with telaprevir addition to peginterferon/ribavirin in treatment of aggressive hepatitis C in null responders to PR post-OLT.Adult patients with recurrent HCV infection post-OLT with null response to peginterferon/ribavirin for 12 wk (<2 log reduction) received four-wk lead-in PEG-IFN alfa-2b (1.0 ?g/kg/wk) plus RBV (600-1000 mg/d) followed by addition of telaprevir 750 q8. All patients were converted to cyclosporine from tacrolimus (TAC).Seven patients (3 M, 4 F), mean age 56 yr, were treated. Three were <1 yr post-OLT, six had cirrhosis and one bridging fibrosis. Three of seven achieved sustained virologic response. All patients required RBV dose reduction, 6/7 required erythropoietin, 5/7 required filgrastim, and 2/7 required eltrombopag for platelets <20 000 ?L. There were no supratherapeutic/subtherapeutic CYA levels encountered, no episodes of renal insufficiency.Conversion to CYA followed by four-wk peginterferon/ribavirin lead-in with addition of telaprevir can lead to significant clearance rates at week 24 in null responders with advanced fibrosis although high rates of anemia/RBV dose reduction, growth factor, and transfusion requirements were noted.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708229","annotations":[{"name":"Erythropoietin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Filgrastim","weight":0.835104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filgrastim"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.774159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.436368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Telaprevir","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telaprevir"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Wicket-keeper","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper"},{"name":"Eltrombopag","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eltrombopag"},{"name":"Ostfriesische Lufttransport","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostfriesische_Lufttransport"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.0238624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Lumber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Moru language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moru_language"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Clearance rate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_rate"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
