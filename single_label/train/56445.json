{"id":56445,"title":"[Morphometric assessment of the macula in spongiform macular edema treated with antivasoproliferative therapy].","abstract":"Antivasoproliferative therapy is a pathogenetic treatment for diabetic macular edema. The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of ranibizumab on foveolar parameters in spongiform macular edema. A total of 37 patients (38 eyes) with spongiform macular edema were assessed and given antivasoproliferative therapy with ranibizumab. Optical coherence tomography showed a reduction of the total retinal thickness by 44 microm (from 306 +/- 77 microm to 262 +/- 30 microm, p < 0.05). The pigment epithelium thickness within the central area changed from 21 +/- 4 microm to 40 +/- 9 microm. The maximum decrease of the outer nuclear layer thickness was noted in 400 +/- 100 microm from foveola and averaged from 72 +/- 19 microm to 29 +/- 6 microm with its gradual increase to the periphery to 100 +/- 8 microm.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684064","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.82397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Macula of retina","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula_of_retina"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.432785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.423377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Outer nuclear layer","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_nuclear_layer"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.270474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.227918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"306","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/306"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"}]}
