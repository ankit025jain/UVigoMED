{"id":14196,"title":"Assessment of viral interference using a chemical receptor blocker against avian influenza and establishment of protection levels in field outbreaks.","abstract":"Avian influenza (AI) currently poses a serious problem for poultry farming worldwide. Its prevalence in Mexico, despite vaccination, has highlighted the need for new approaches to control AI and reduce the economic losses associated with its occurrence in susceptible birds. The different interactions between AI viruses (AIV) and cellular receptors have been described, along with the affinity of some viruses for certain types of species-specific receptors. This receptor-ligand specificity, combined with an understanding of viral interference processes and their relevance in different viral models, permits the assessment of new strategies for controlling AIV. The present study was designed to investigate the feasibility of using viral interference as a novel approach for AIV control, taking advantage of the high receptor-ligand specificity between AIV and animal cells. The results from field outbreak tests and cell culture analysis along with measurements of specific antibodies against AIV demonstrate that the mortality associated with AI infection can be reduced by using a receptor blocker against AIV. This receptor blocker approach also has the potential to be used on an industrial scale for the efficient control of AIV.
