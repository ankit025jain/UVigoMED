{"id":8633,"title":"[Effects of extracts from ziziphi spinosae semen and schisandrae chinensis fructus on amino acid neurotransmitter in rats with insomnia induced by PCPA].","abstract":"To observe the effects of extract from Ziziphus Spinosa Semen and Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus on the content of amino acid neurotransmitter in the hypothalamus of insomnia rats induced by P-Chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) and its mechanism.The model of insomnia rats were established by PCPA intraperitoneal injection, after the modeling, all the therapeutic group were treated with corresponding drug for one week. The hypothalamus pathological changes of the rats were observed. The contents of GABA, Glu in the hypothalamus were detected by Elisa. The GABA, Glu protein expression were detected by immunohistochemical. GABA(A), R(alpha1) and GABA(A)R(gamma2) mRNA expressions were detected by RT-PCR.Compared with model group, the content of GABA in the hypothalamus of rats increased obviously in the alcohol-water group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), while the content of Glu decreased obviously (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).The extract from Ziziphus Spinosae Semen and Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus has obviously Sedative-hypnotic effect. Its mechanism may be related to regulating the content of amino acid neurotransmitter in the hypothalamus of rats.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761674","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothalamus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Gamma-Aminobutyric acid","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.836937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.66717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.616623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.422873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
