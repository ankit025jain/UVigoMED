{"id":87210,"title":"Birth of a normal child after in vitro fertilization treatment followed by dengue fever.","abstract":"Dengue is a serious public health issue due to its escalating aspect. It is also not yet established whether dengue has any impact on the outcome of assisted reproductive technique for infertility treatments. To our knowledge there are no published data in this subject. Therefore we describe a successful case of birth after in vitro fertilization (IVF) followed by dengue fever.A couple with primary unexplained infertility was submitted to IVF. The patient was submitted to ovulation induction with long protocol. A total of 12 oocytes were retrieved and two embryos were transferred. On the evening of the embryo transfer the patient started with headache and retro-orbital pain, followed by fever and nausea. Two days later she started with vomiting and diarrhea and epistaxis. The tourniquet test was positive. After patient's exams showed hemoconcentration and low platelet count (<50,000/mm(3)) the diagnosis of dengue hemorrhagic fever was confirmed and she was hospitalized and parenterally hydrated. As there was a good response to treatment, the patient was discharged the next day.A serum ?hCG concentration 14 days after oocyte retrieval was positive. A healthy infant was born at the thirty-ninth gestational week by cesarean section.To our knowledge this is the first successful case reported on a patient who had dengue fever immediately after embryo transfer in an IVF treatment cycle. As dengue becomes a public health problem, it is important to bring attention to the subject.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24961321","annotations":[{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.920421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.867149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.861972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.826989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tourniquet","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourniquet"},{"name":"Ovulation","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.706221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.649851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.594388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Embryo transfer","weight":0.564499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_transfer"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.545987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.491223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.444178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.348154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.308977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Epistaxis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistaxis"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Rehydration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehydration"},{"name":"Transvaginal oocyte retrieval","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvaginal_oocyte_retrieval"},{"name":"Viral hemorrhagic fever","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hemorrhagic_fever"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
