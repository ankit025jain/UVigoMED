{"id":44151,"title":"Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease: two new oral formulations dexlansoprazole MR and esomezol (esomeprazole strontium).","abstract":"The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease continues to increase with the aging population and the obesity epidemic. Therapeutic failures can have significant detrimental effects in patients. Recently, dexlansoprazole MR and esomeprazole strontium were introduced to the class of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).This article will review the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole MR and esomeprazole strontium. Using the keywords 'dexlansoprazole MR' and 'esomeprazole strontium' in the search engines of PubMed, Cochrane Reviews and Google, we were able to identify peer-reviewed publications, abstracts and presentations at national society educations meetings and present a balanced view of the available data.Dexlansoprazole MR and esomeprazole strontium offer an innovative delivery mechanism compared to conventional PPIs. Further trials are necessary in order to establish superiority.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749891","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.827906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.63593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.490321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.377943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.286358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.203234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Esomeprazole","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esomeprazole"},{"name":"Google","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Strontium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium"},{"name":"Dexlansoprazole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexlansoprazole"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Internal combustion engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Keywords","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keywords"},{"name":"Web search engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Population ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing"}]}
