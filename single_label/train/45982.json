{"id":45982,"title":"Variant alleles of VEGF and risk of esophageal cancer and lymph node metastasis.","abstract":"The variant alleles of the functional polymorphisms, VEGF -2578 C?>?A, -1498 T?>?C and +936 C?>?T, were not associated with risk of esophageal cancer and lymph node metastasis. Compared with the most common haplotype, C-2578T-1498C+936, the A-2578C-1498C+936 haplotype was associated with a borderline significantly increased risk of esophageal cancer. C-2578C-1498C+936 and A-2578T-1498T+936 haplotypes were associated with significantly increased risk of esophageal cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent stimulator for angiogenesis. It has been implicated in the growth and metastasis of esophageal cancer. Three functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VEGF (-2578 C?>?A, -1498 T?>?C and +936 C?>?T) are known to be related to VEGF expression. We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the effects of these three functional SNPs on the development of esophageal cancer and lymph node metastasis. A total of 497 cases and 380 controls were analyzed. Genotypes were determined by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and direct sequence methods. The variant alleles of the functional polymorphisms VEGF -2578 C?>?A, -1498 T?>?C and +936 C?>?T SNPs were not associated with esophageal cancer risk. These VEGF genotypes were not associated with the risk of esophageal cancer after stratification. Furthermore, no association was observed between VEGF -2578 C?>?A, -1498 T?>?C and +936 C?>?T polymorphisms and lymph node metastasis. Compared with the most common haplotype C-2578T-1498C+936, the A-2578C-1498C+936 haplotype was associated with a borderline significantly increased risk of esophageal cancer. C-2578C-1498C+936 and A-2578T-1498T+936 haplotypes were associated with significantly increased risk of esophageal cancer. Variants in the functional polymorphisms of VEGF may not contribute to esophageal cancer and lymph node metastasis susceptibility. VEGF A-2578C-1498C+936, C-2578C-1498C+936 and A-2578T-1498T+936 haplotypes may be associated with increased risk of esophageal cancer. However, our results were obtained with a limited sample size and therefore this is a preliminary conclusion. Validation by a larger study with more diverse ethnic populations is needed.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654773","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.782628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.73916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.723532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.548547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.40565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.347559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.282867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.234564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.10897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"1498","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1498"},{"name":"Direct-sequence spread spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-sequence_spread_spectrum"},{"name":"380","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/380"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"}]}
