{"id":83395,"title":"[Determinants of strategic management of a health center].","abstract":"The article highlights the value of a strategic approach for the development of a primary care health centre.The method is adapted from corporate strategy: (i) analysis of the situation of the health centre and the obstacles to its development. (ii) selection of relations on which the strategy can be developed. (iii) elaboration of a system of interventions to create a cumulative development process. (iv) Illustration of the method by application to a case.The example illustrates the principles and method and highlights the importance of interpretations and choices in elaboration of a strategy, which is therefore always a unique construction.The strategic approach provides a framework that (i) provides a subject of discussion and negotiation between members of the health centre, (ii) strengthens the consistency of structural decisions, (iii) helps the health centre to overcome obstacles and initiate a development process.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25380266","annotations":[{"name":"Management","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Strategic management","weight":0.700068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_management"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.622971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.39108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.25501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.223504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Negotiation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiation"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Software development","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development"},{"name":"Illustration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illustration"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Centrism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Community health center","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health_center"},{"name":"Software development process","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process"},{"name":"Organization development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_development"},{"name":"Conceptual framework","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework"}]}
