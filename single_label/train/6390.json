{"id":6390,"title":"Characterization of meticillin-resistant and meticillin-susceptible isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius from cases of canine pyoderma in Australia.","abstract":"Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) has recently emerged as a worldwide cause of canine pyoderma. In this study, we characterized 22 S. pseudintermedius isolates cultured from 19 dogs with pyoderma that attended a veterinary dermatology referral clinic in Australia in 2011 and 2012. Twelve isolates were identified as MRSP by mecA real-time PCR and phenotypic resistance to oxacillin. In addition to ?-lactam resistance, MRSP isolates were resistant to erythromycin (91.6?%), gentamicin (83.3?%), ciprofloxacin (83.3?%), chloramphenicol (75?%), clindamycin (66?%), oxytetracycline (66?%) and tetracycline (50?%), as shown by disc-diffusion susceptibility testing. Meticillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius isolates only showed resistance to penicillin/ampicillin (90?%) and tetracycline (10?%). PFGE using the SmaI restriction enzyme was unable to type nine of the 12 MRSP isolates. However the nine isolates provided the same PFGE pulsotype using the Cfr91 restriction enzyme. Application of the mec-associated direct repeat unit (dru) typing method identified the nine SmaI PFGE-untypable isolates as dt11cb, a dru type that has only previously been associated with MRSP sequence type (ST)45 isolates that possess a unique SCCmec element. The dt11cb isolates shared a similar multidrug-resistant antibiogram phenotype profile, whereas the other MRSP isolates, dt11a, dt11af (dt11a-associated) and dt10h, were resistant to fewer antibiotic classes and had distinct PFGE profiles. This is the first report of MRSP causing pyoderma in dogs from Australia. The rapid intercontinental emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant MRSP strains confirms the urgent need for new treatment modalities for recurrent canine pyoderma in veterinary practice.
