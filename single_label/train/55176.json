{"id":55176,"title":"Topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy for irregular astigmatism after small incision lenticule extraction.","abstract":"To report the outcome of topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) after complicated small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE).Retrospective case series of 5 eyes with irregular topography and ghost images after complicated SMILE. All eyes received transepithelial topography-guided PRK. Two eyes were treated with 0.02% mitomycin C. Patients were examined after a minimum of 3 months with evaluation of uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuity, Pentacam tomography (Oculus Optikger√§te, Wetzlar, Germany), and whole-eye aberrometry.In 3 eyes, subjective symptoms were diminished and UDVA, CDVA, topography, and corneal wavefront aberrations were improved. The remaining 2 eyes developed significant haze with worsened topography and wavefront aberrations. One eye experienced a two-line reduction in CDVA. Eyes with haze development had not been treated with mitomycin C.Transepithelial topography-guided PRK may reduce visual symptoms after complicated SMILE if postoperative haze can be controlled. To reduce the risk of haze development, application of mitomycin C may be considered.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972410","annotations":[{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.594083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.541196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Wavefront","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Photorefractive keratectomy","weight":0.185256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy"},{"name":"Astigmatism (eye)","weight":0.154987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_(eye)"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Wetzlar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetzlar"},{"name":"Mitomycin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitomycin"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Ghost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Life and death","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_and_death"},{"name":"SMILE (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMILE_(magazine)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Photorefractive effect","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_effect"},{"name":"Developmental psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Oculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus"},{"name":"Haze","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haze"}]}
