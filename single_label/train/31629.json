{"id":31629,"title":"[Early screening of developmental dysplasia of the hip among hospitalized children].","abstract":"To summarize retrospectively developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) screening of children within 36 months.Newborn infants underwent initial DDH screening at First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University from September 2011 to May 2013. The examinations included double hip function, abduction test and Ortolani/Barlow test. After initial DDH screening, suspected and abnormal infants were transferred to our department for re-screening. And clinical physical examinations, type B ultrasound or radiological imaging were performed for confirmation or elimination.A total of 10 428 children were DDH screened. And 1 260 children were examined with ultrasound and 346 suspected and abnormal children (445 hips) were transferred for further assessments. Among them, 33 children (49 hips) were positive with Ortolani or Barlow test, 61 children (88 hips) had dysplasia of hip and 48 children (14 boys, 34 girls) (69 hips) received a final diagnosis of DDH. Left (n = 52) and right hip (n = 17) were involved with a disease incidence of DDH at 0.46%.Ultrasonic examination is both simple and cost-effective for DDH screening of children within 6 months. And meticulous medical examinations and imaging studies are effective DDH screening for children from 6 to 36 months.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25146746","annotations":[{"name":"Infant","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.746087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.740189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.644453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.524183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Zhengzhou","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengzhou"},{"name":"Zhengzhou University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengzhou_University"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (human)","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(human)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Left-wing politics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"},{"name":"428","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/428"},{"name":"260","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/260"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"346","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/346"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"AND1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND1"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Riz Ortolani","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riz_Ortolani"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Abduction (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Stellar classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"},{"name":"Iroquois class destroyer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_class_destroyer"}]}
