{"id":74072,"title":"Lack of efficacy of Tai Chi in improving quality of life in breast cancer survivors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"It is controversial whether Tai Chi (TC) benefits breast cancer survivors (BCS) on quality of life (QoL). We therefore undertook a meta-analysis to assess this question.A computerized search through electronic databases was performed to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcome was QoL, while secondary outcomes included body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD), and muscle strength.Five RCTs involving 407 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled standardized mean differences were 0.10 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.35-0.54) for physical well- being, 0.03 (95%CI: -0.18-0.25) for social/family well-being, 0.24 (95%CI: 0.02-0.45) for emotional well-being, 0.23 (95%CI: -0.03-0.49) for functional well-being, and 0.09 (95%CI: -0.19-0.36) for additional concerns. TC failed to improve BMI, BMD, and muscle strength.There is currently lack of sufficient evidence to support TC improving QoL and other important clinical endpoints.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24870782","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.748874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.747629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.615908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.479276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.440102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.416282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.345853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.339783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.330391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Tai chi chuan","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi_chuan"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"}]}
