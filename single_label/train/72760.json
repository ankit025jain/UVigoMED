{"id":72760,"title":"Multiple primary cancers as a guide to heritability.","abstract":"There are approximately 100 genes which when mutated are known to predispose to one or more forms of cancer. Currently, genetic testing is offered for many of these, either as single genes or as multi-gene panels. Features of hereditary cancer include a positive family history of cancer, early age of onset and the appearance of multiple primary cancers in one individual. In some cases multiple cancers may be of the same site (e.g., bilateral breast cancer) and in other cases they may be at different sites. Various combinations of cancer sites may be indicative of specific cancer syndromes such as the breast ovarian cancer syndrome. Genetic testing should be offered to individuals who have experienced multiple primary cancers in some circumstances, the genetic counselor should review the ages of sites of cancer, their pathologic features and the family history of cancer as part of the pre-test evaluation.
