{"id":37621,"title":"Chronic suppurative lung disease in a developing country: impact on child and parent.","abstract":"To investigate the impact of chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) on growth and lung function in the child as well as quality of life of the child and parent.Cross-sectional study in 60 children with CSLD, bronchiectasis (including cystic fibrosis) and bronchiolitis obliterans. Thirty-five parents were interviewed while the remaining patients' data were collated from medical notes. Anthropometric measurements at first diagnosis and at interview were compared. The most recent lung function was also collected. The Parent Cough-Specific Quality of Life (PC-QOL) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS21) questionnaires were administered to parents.The median (range) age at diagnosis was 1.3 (0.2-11) years. The median (IQR) duration between anthropometric measurements was 35 (15, 59) months. Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) had improvements both in weight and BMI, whereas children with non-CF CSLD had no improvements in any growth parameter. Seventy-eight percent of children who performed spirometry had values <80% of normal predicted value. PC-QOL scores were low. Frequent exacerbations (more than twice in the past 6 months) and cough (more than 2 days/week) were not associated with significantly lower PC-QOL scores. Seventy-seven percent of interviewed parents had abnormal DASS21 scores with 54% being stressed and 51% being depressed. Mental health was better in parents of children with CF.CSLD had a negative impact on growth, lung function, and quality of life. Children with CF had a better outcome in growth as well as better parental mental health compared to children with other etiologies. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2014; 49:435-440.
