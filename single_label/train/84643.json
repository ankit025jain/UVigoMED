{"id":84643,"title":"The efficacy of hospital-based food program as galactogogues in early period of lactation.","abstract":"Galactogogue food has been frequently used among lactating women without reported efficacy data. The present study was aimed to address the outcome of hospital-based food programs as defined by the onset of lactation and infant's weight loss.A Quasi-experimental design was done to compare the maternal breast fullness/heaviness and infants' body weight among 106 women in galactogogue group and 127 controls. Data was gathered daily from the 1st day of postpartum through the date discharged regarding timing of first breast feeding, nursing frequency, LATCH score, nonbreast-milk fluid, breast fullness/hardness, leakage of colostrum/breast milk, let-down reflex and infants' body weight.Maternal report of breast fullness/heaviness within the first 48 hours in galactogogue group was significantly more than control (71.7% and 56.7%, respectively; p < 0.001). Proportion of infant who had an excessive weight loss, as defined by weight loss more than 7% within the first 48 hours, in galactogogue group was significantly lower than controls (15.1% and 24.4%, respectively; p = 0.043).The use of traditional food as hospital-based food program had some efficacies in the early period of lactation, regarding presence of breast fullness and reduction of infant's weight loss. However the efficacy in maintaining breast milk production should be further studied. Likewise, frequent breastfeeding and thorough emptying of breasts definitely result in increased milk production and should be evaluated in all lactating women.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065085","annotations":[{"name":"Lactation","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Human breast milk","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_breast_milk"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.720071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.715417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.499463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Galactagogue","weight":0.211645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactagogue"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0900986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Dairy farming","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Isofix","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isofix"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Data (Star Trek)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
