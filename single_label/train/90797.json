{"id":90797,"title":"A fracture prevention service reduces further fractures two years after incident minimal trauma fracture.","abstract":"To evaluate the impact of a fracture prevention clinic service on initiation of treatment, continuing treatment and subsequent minimal trauma fractures (MTF).Participants were people aged 50 and over, with a minimal trauma fracture presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) in a large tertiary referral hospital in New South Wales, Australia, between February 2007 and March 2009. A cohort of patients who attended a Fracture Prevention Clinic (clinic group) were compared with a cohort who did not attend the clinic (non-clinic group). A telephone questionnaire was conducted with participants or their carers between December 2010 and April 2011 at least 12 months post-fracture presentation. Questionnaire items included demographics, fracture types, osteoporosis treatment, recurrent fractures and smoking and dietary habits. Data were compared using chi-squared test for categorical variables and Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables.Two hundred and fourteen clinic attendees and 220 non-clinic attendees were surveyed between 12 and 40 months (mean 24 months) post-initial fracture. New fracture rates were lower in the clinic group (5.1%) than the non-clinic group (16.4%, P < 0.001). Treatment rates for bone fragility were higher in the clinic group (81.3%) than in the non-clinic group (54.1%, P < 0.001) with 66.8% of the clinic group and 34.1% of the non-clinic group on a bisphosphonate or strontium ranelate at the time of the survey (P < 0.001).Patients managed by a fracture prevention clinic service following a MTF have fewer new fractures and are more likely to be on treatment for bone fragility.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Wounds and
