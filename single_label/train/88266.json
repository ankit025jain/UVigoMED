{"id":88266,"title":"Sea urchin spine arthritis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the hand: radiological, intraoperative and histopathological findings.","abstract":"Penetrating sea urchin spine injuries, can lead to devastating, irreversible consequences. Persistent inflammation, cutaneous granuloma, neuroma, tenosynovitis, arthritis and destructive arthritis, leading to permanent loss of function and digit amputation, can occur. We present a case of a patient who developed sea urchin spine arthritis of the proximal interphalangeal joint. Only 17 cases of sea urchin spine arthritis of the hand have been documented in the medical literature. However, in this case, the article also includes sequential radiographs, histopathological slides, and intra-operative photographs.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875516","annotations":[{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.72334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.688377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Sea urchin","weight":0.640918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_urchin"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.622055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.536637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Interphalangeal articulations of hand","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interphalangeal_articulations_of_hand"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.246264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tenosynovitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenosynovitis"},{"name":"Neuroma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroma"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Lost episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_episode"},{"name":"Medical literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_literature"},{"name":"Sea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
