{"id":84154,"title":"Pharmacokinetics of short versus extended infusion meropenem dosing in critically ill patients: a pilot study.","abstract":"To test whether a prolonged 3-hour infusion of meropenem 500mg achieves an equivalent proportion of time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (%TMIC) to that of meropenem 1000mg given over 30 minutes.A randomised crossover study in 10 critically ill patients.We administered meropenem as a 1000mg, 30-minute infusion or as a 500mg, 3-hour infusion. We determined serial plasma concentrations for each dosing episode and performed comparisons of %TMIC at different MICs.The percentage of time that meropenem was above its MIC.For low MICs (?2 mg/L), both regimens attained a %TMIC >40% in all patients. For an MIC of 4mg/L, this target was attained in all but one patient, but with an MIC of 8mg/L, three patients in each group had a %TMIC <40%. There was no difference in target attainment between the two regimens for MICs up to 8mg/L. There was marked variability in the pharmacokinetic and hence the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameters between individuals. Several patients had elevated creatinine clearances and, with both regimens, their target attainment was poor.Meropenem at 1000mg over 30 minutes achieved a similar %TMIC to meropenem at 500mg given over 3 hours. Meropenem pharmacokinetics were highly variable from individual to individual.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25161021","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.759104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.331221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Meropenem","weight":0.179468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meropenem"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.162488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.036206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0321906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Bardo Pond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo_Pond"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Highland Clearances","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Clearances"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
