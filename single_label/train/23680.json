{"id":23680,"title":"Mucormycosis--from the pathogens to the disease.","abstract":"Mucormycosis is an emerging fungal infection worldwide, with devastating disease symptoms and diverse clinical manifestations. The most important underlying risk factors are immunosuppression, poorly controlled diabetes, iron overload and major trauma. The aetiological agents involved in the disease have been re-classified due to changes in taxonomy and nomenclature, which also led to appropriately naming the disease 'mucormycosis'. This article shortly explains the new nomenclature, clinical manifestations and risk factors and focuses on putative virulence traits associated with mucormycosis, mainly in the group of diabetic ketoacidotic patients.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476149","annotations":[{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.836183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.721216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.697854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.360512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Iron overload","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_overload"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Nomenclature","weight":0.124839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Mucormycosis","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucormycosis"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
