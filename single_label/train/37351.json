{"id":37351,"title":"[Giant orofacial teratoma of the fetus (epignathus) - prenatal 2d and three-dimensional 3D ultrasound detection of this rare condition].","abstract":"An epignathus is an extremely rare form of oropharyngeal teratoma that arises from the oral cavity, most commonly from the palate and is associated with a high mortality secondary to airway obstruction in the neonatal period. We present a case of prenatal diagnosis in 29 w.g. preterm baby with a giant epignathus, preterm birth and fetal death. We discuss the incidence of these tumors, the antenatal diagnosis and the prognosis and management of this condition.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501881","annotations":[{"name":"Teratoma","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratoma"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"3D ultrasound","weight":0.812028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_ultrasound"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Perinatal mortality","weight":0.714353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perinatal_mortality"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.670587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.253016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.189239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0625596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Gigantism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantism"},{"name":"Three-dimensional space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Airway obstruction","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_obstruction"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}]}
