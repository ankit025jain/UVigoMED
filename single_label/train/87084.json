{"id":87084,"title":"Molecular investigation and cultivation of camelpox virus in Iran.","abstract":"Camelpox virus (genus Orthopoxvirus, family Poxviridae) is the etiologic agent of camel pox. The clinical manifestations of this virus range from inapparent infection to mild, moderate and, less commonly, severe systemic infection and death. Following an outbreak of camelpox, samples that were collected from camel flocks suspected to have camelpox in Qom Province in central Iran and Khash city, Sistan and Baluchestan Province and South Khorasan Province in eastern Iran were sent to Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute in Mashhad. DNA extraction was performed primarily by the phenol-chloroform method, and PCR was carried out using a Bioneer kit. Using the primer pair 5'-AAT-ACA-AGG-AGG-ATC-T-3' and 5'-CTT-AAC-TTT-TTC-TTT-CTC-3', the gene sequence encoding the A-type inclusion protein (ATIP) was amplified. The size of the PCR product, specific for camelpox virus, was 881 bp. The PCR product was purified, and to confirm its sequence, it was sent to the reference laboratory. The sequence was subjected to a BLAST search and then phylogenetically analyzed using CLC software. The results showed that all samples were nearly 100 % identical to each other and to strains CMS and M-96. These isolates also had 99 % and 95 % similarity to the CP-1 strain and isolate FIN/T2000, respectively. In Vero cell culture, inoculation with this virus caused a cytopathic effect (CPE), which appeared 2-5 days post-inoculation. Characteristic CPE showing foci of rounded cells, ballooning, giant-cell formation and syncytia with degenerative changes appeared.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Virus
