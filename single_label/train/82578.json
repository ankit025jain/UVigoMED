{"id":82578,"title":"Effect of fluoride gels supplemented with sodium trimetaphosphate on enamel erosion and abrasion: in vitro study.","abstract":"This in vitro study aims to evaluate the effect of low fluoride (F) gel associate sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) on erosion with or without abrasion.Enamel blocks (4 mm Ã— 4 mm) selected through surface hardness (SH) is divided into five groups (n=12): gel without F and TMP (placebo), gel containing 4500 ppm F (4500), gel containing 4500 ppm F plus TMP5% (4500 TMP5%), gel containing 9000 ppm F (9000), and gel containing 12,300 ppm F (acid gel). Those groups were additionally subdivided into conditions of erosion (Ero) and of erosion plus abrasion (Ero/Abra). The blocks have undergone a single application of gel on the first day of the study. The erosion challenge was produced by Sprite Zero for five minutes four times a day and abrasion was carried out by machine brushing for 15s. After the challenges, the surface hardness (%SH), wear and cross-sectional hardness (?KHN) were analyzed. The data were analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA test followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls (p<0.05).Lower values of %SH, wear and ?KHN were observed for erosion challenge (p<0.001). The %SH was lower in groups treated with fluoride gels, differing in the placebo (p<0.05). With addition of TMP to the gel 4500, enamel wear was lower when compared with another groups (p<0.05).In vitro conditions, the 4500 5%TMP gel showed greatest effect against erosion and erosion/abrasion.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581857","annotations":[{"name":"Parts-per notation","weight":0.80122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.729353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.574279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.534729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.472889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.311611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Hardness","weight":0.25424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.110673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Sprite Zero","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_Zero"},{"name":"Sodium trimetaphosphate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_trimetaphosphate"},{"name":"Sprite (soft drink)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(soft_drink)"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Thiol","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiol"},{"name":"0 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Pulp (paper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(paper)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Subdivision (land)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivision_(land)"},{"name":"Vickers hardness test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers_hardness_test"},{"name":"Abrasion (mechanical)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasion_(mechanical)"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"GWR 4500 Class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GWR_4500_Class"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Ero","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ero"}]}
