{"id":88574,"title":"[Anchors and peroneous brevis tendon augmentation and plantaris muscle tendon covering for the reconstruction of achilles tendon rupture caused by corticosteroids injection].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical therapeutic effects of anchors, peroneus brevis tendon augmentation and plantaris muscle tendon covering on the reconstruction of achilles tendon rupture caused by corticosteroids injection.From March 2005 to April 2010, the clinical data of 10 patients with acute achilles tendon rupture repaired with suture anchors, peroneus brevis tendon augmentation and plantaris muscle tendon covering were retrospectively analyzed. The achilles tendon rupture was caused by corticosteroids injection. There were 8 males and 2 females with a mean age of (46.80 +/- 2.83) years old(ranged from 21 to 68 years). Postoperative complications, the range of movement of affected foot, number of consecutive heel raises and single leg jumpings were recorded. Functional recovery of achilles tendon were assessed according to ankle and hindfoot scores of the American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Society (AOFAS).All patients were followed up for 12 to 18 months with an average of 13.5 months. No wound infection, re-rupture and rejection reaction were found. At the last follow-up, there was no significant difference in the range of movement between affected foot (54.5 +/- 6.3) degrees and unaffected foot (56.8 +/- 3.8) degrees (t = 0.989, P = 0.336). The affected foot could raise heel and do single-leg hops for 10 times continuosly. There was significant difference in AOFAS between preoperative score (67.3 +/- 7.6) and postoperative score (95.5 +/- 7.6) (t = 8.297, P = 0.000);and there was no significant difference between affected foot scores (95.5 +/- 7.6)and unaffected foot scores (98.5 +/- 6.3) (t = 0.961, P = 0.349). Function recovery of achilles tendon: 9 cases were good, 1 case was fine.Anchors, peroneus brevis tendon augmentation and plantaris muscle tendon covering for the reconstruction of achilles tendon rupture caused by corticosteroids injection is a reliable and effective method, with advantage of simple operation, dependable fixation and less complications.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24826475","annotations":[{"name":"Achilles tendon","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.789222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.695775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.619832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.57446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Peroneus brevis","weight":0.389423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroneus_brevis"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.256114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Plantaris muscle","weight":0.217222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantaris_muscle"},{"name":"Heel","weight":0.212411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.195212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Peroneus muscles","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroneus_muscles"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"961","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/961"},{"name":"989","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/989"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"KDFO","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDFO"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Hops","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hops"}]}
