{"id":43311,"title":"[Effect of CD133(+) cells on the radiosensitivity of rectal cancer cells].","abstract":"To investigate the effect of CD133(+) cells on radiosensitivity of rectal cancer cells.In vitro experiments: CD133(+) cells were purified with Immunomagnetic beads from human rectal cancer cell line SW480 cells and annexin V/PI staining was used to determine apoptosis in CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells. In vivo experiments: Transplanted rectal tumor was established in 30 nude mice using primarily established SW480 cells. The tumor cells were divided into CD133-high and CD133-low groups based on the immunohistochemical staining of CD133 expression of the tumor cells. The tumor size after irradiation was recorded every three days.CD133(+) cells had a much lower percentage of apoptosis after radiation exposure compared with CD133(-) cells [(12.6 ± 3.2) % vs. (38.8 ± 6.7) %, P < 0.01]. In vivo experiment showed that the normalized tumor size of CD133-high group (3.00 ± 0.32) became significantly larger than that of the CD133-low group(2.55 ± 0.29) at the ninth day and this difference lasted until the observation end (P < 0.05).CD133(+) cells have a radioresistant effect on rectal cancer cells and may become a potential therapeutic target in the radiotherapy of rectal cancer.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796457","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.836841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.544019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.527719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Radioresistance","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioresistance"},{"name":"Nude mouse","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"},{"name":"Radiosensitivity","weight":0.143958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosensitivity"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.0703344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Bead","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Polytechnic_Institute_and_State_University"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Nudity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Protein purification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_purification"}]}
