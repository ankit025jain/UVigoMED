{"id":53076,"title":"Joint associations of physical activity and hypertension with the development of type 2 diabetes among urban men and women in Mainland China.","abstract":"Physical activity (PA) and hypertension (HTN) are important influences on the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the joint impact of PA and HTN on T2D development is unknown.Two community-based prospective cohort studies, with the same protocols, instruments and questionnaires, were conducted among adults in urban areas of Nanjing, China, during 2004-2007 and 2007-2010. T2D was defined using World Health Organization criteria based on physicians' diagnosis and fasting blood glucose concentration. PA level (sufficient/insufficient) and blood pressure status (hypertensive/normotensive) were assessed at baseline and the third year of follow-up. We pooled and analyzed data from these two studies.Among 4550 participants aged 35 years or older, the three-year cumulative incidence of T2D was 5.1%. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants with sufficient PA were less likely to develop T2D than those with insufficient PA (OR = 0.43, 95%CI = 0.27, 0.68) and those who were normotensive were less likely to develop T2D than those who were hypertensive (OR = 0.39, 95%CI = 0.29, 0.51). Compared to participants with insufficient PA and who were hypertensive, those with sufficient PA and hypertension were at lower risk of developing T2D (OR = 0.36, 95%CI = 0.19, 0.69), as were those with insufficient PA who were normotensive (OR = 0.37, 95%CI = 0.28, 0.50) and those with sufficient PA who were normotensive (OR = 0.19, 95%CI = 0.10, 0.37).Insufficient PA was found to be associated with the development of T2D among adults with and without hypertension. These findings support a role for promoting higher physical activity levels to lower T2D risk in both hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551143","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.76892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"China","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.714865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.663049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.36771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.358789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.2707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.127246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.120719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Mainland China","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Nanjing","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0227032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"}]}
