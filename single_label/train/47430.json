{"id":47430,"title":"Small (?1-cm) hepatocellular carcinoma: diagnostic performance and imaging features at gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging.","abstract":"To assess diagnostic performance and imaging features of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in small (?1-cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detection in patients with chronic liver disease.The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived informed consent. Sixty patients (56 men, four women; mean age, 60.1 years) with HCC (146 lesions; 70 > 1 cm, 76 ? 1 cm) underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging. HCC was confirmed at surgical resection (72 lesions; 30 > 1 cm, 42 ? 1 cm) or by showing interval growth with typical enhancement patterns at follow-up dynamic computed tomography or MR imaging (74 lesions; 40 > 1 cm, 34 ? 1 cm). Two radiologists assessed MR imaging features and graded likelihood of HCC with a five-point confidence scale. Jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC) method was used.Mean JAFROC figure of merit for small HCC was 0.717; that for large (>1-cm) HCC was 0.973 with substantial agreement (? = 0.676). Mean sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were 46.0% (70 of 152) and 48.3% (70 of 145) for small HCC versus 95.0% (133 of 140) and 78.2% (133 of 170) for large HCC, respectively. Eleven of 76 small HCCs (14%) were not seen on MR images, even after careful investigation. MR imaging features of small HCC included arterial enhancement (79%, 60 of 76), hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images (68%, 52 of 76), washout on 3-minute delayed phase images (50%, 38 of 76), hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (43%, 33 of 76), hypointensity on T1-weighted images (32%, 24 of 76), and restriction on diffusion-weighted images (28%, 20 of 72). Arterial enhancement and washout on 3-minute delayed phase images or hypointensity on HBP images occurred in 66% of small HCCs (50 of 76).Diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging for small HCC detection is still low, with mean sensitivity of 46.0% (70 of 152) and mean PPV of 48.3% (70 of 145). By adding hypointensity on HBP images as washout, diagnostic performance for small HCC detection can be improved.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24588677","annotations":[{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.822584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.701997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.50565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.456024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.455046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Hyperintensity","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperintensity"}]}
