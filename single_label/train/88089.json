{"id":88089,"title":"The prevalence, aetiology and management of wounds in a community care area in Ireland.","abstract":"This study aimed to establish the prevalence and aetiology of wounds, allowing an insight into the management of wound care, the use of dressings and the nursing time allocated to the provision of wound care in a community setting in Ireland. A cross-sectional survey was used, with data collected on all clients in the community who received treatment from public health nurses or community registered general nurses for wound care over a 1-week period in April 2013. A 98.9% response rate was realised, and 188 people were identified as having wounds, equating to a crude prevalence of 5% of the active community nursing caseload. A total of 60% (n=112) had leg ulcers, 22% (n=42) had pressure ulcers, 16% (n=30) had an acute wound (surgical or traumatic wounds), 1% (n=2) had a diabetic foot wound and a further 1% (n=2) had wounds of other aetiologies. The mean duration of wounds was 5.41 months. A total of 18% of wounds were identified as infected; however, 60% (n=112) of wounds had antimicrobial products in use as either a primary or secondary dressing. The study established that there is a significant prevalence of wounds in this community care area. There was absence of a clinical diagnosis in many cases, and evidence of inappropriate dressing use, risking an increase in costs and a decrease in good clinical outcomes. It also highlighted the importance of ongoing education and auditing in the provision of wound care.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24912830","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.749649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Ireland","weight":0.740241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.668499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.630919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.521449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.501421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.396646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.365899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.361381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.248919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Bedsore","weight":0.151377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedsore"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Continuing professional development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_professional_development"},{"name":"Venous ulcer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_ulcer"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Clothing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"},{"name":"Primary health care","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_health_care"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
