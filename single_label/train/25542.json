{"id":25542,"title":"Reduced junctional Na+/Ca2+-exchanger activity contributes to sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak in junctophilin-2-deficient mice.","abstract":"Expression silencing of junctophilin-2 (JPH2) in mouse heart leads to ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2)-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) leak and rapid development of heart failure. The mechanism and physiological significance of JPH2 in regulating RyR2-mediated SR Ca(2+) leak remains elusive. We sought to elucidate the role of JPH2 in regulating RyR2-mediated SR Ca(2+) release in the setting of cardiac failure. Cardiac myocytes isolated from tamoxifen-inducible conditional knockdown mice of JPH2 (MCM-shJPH2) were subjected to confocal Ca(2+) imaging. MCM-shJPH2 cardiomyocytes exhibited an increased spark frequency width with altered spark morphology, which caused increased SR Ca(2+) leakage. Single channel studies identified an increased RyR2 open probability in MCM-shJPH2 mice. The increase in spark frequency and width was observed only in MCM-shJPH2 and not found in mice with increased RyR2 open probability with native JPH2 expression. Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger (NCX) activity was reduced by 50% in MCM-shJPH2 with no detectable change in NCX expression. Additionally, 50% inhibition of NCX through Cd(2+) administration alone was sufficient to increase spark width in myocytes obtained from wild-type mice. Additionally, superresolution analysis of RyR2 and NCX colocalization showed a reduced overlap between RyR2 and NCX in MCM-shJPH2 mice. In conclusion, decreased JPH2 expression causes increased SR Ca(2+) leakage by directly increasing open probability of RyR2 and by indirectly reducing junctional NCX activity through increased dyadic cleft Ca(2+). This demonstrates two novel and independent cellular mechanisms by which JPH2 regulates RyR2-mediated SR Ca(2+) leak and heart failure development.
