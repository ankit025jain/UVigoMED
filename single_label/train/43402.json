{"id":43402,"title":"Role of CIP2A in the antitumor effect of bortezomib in colon cancer.","abstract":"Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) has been identified as an oncoprotein that is able to promote the proliferation of cancer cells. The role of CIP2A in the anticancer activity of bortezomib in colon cancer remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the antitumor effect of bortezomib was investigated and the role of CIP2A in determining the effect on colon cancer cells was identified. In the present study, bortezomib demonstrated an antitumor effect, as observed by WST?1 assay and flow cytometry. In addition, the mRNA and protein level of CIP2A was inhibited in a dose?dependent manner by bortezomib with quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blotting. Furthermore, the inhibition of CIP2A with small interfering RNA by treatment with bortezomib inhibited proliferation, increased apoptosis and attenuated the invasion of the cells. Finally, the inÂ vivo data demonstrated that bortezomib was able to decrease the growth of tumors, and that CIP2A was downregulated in the LoVo tumors treated with bortezomib. Therefore, CIP2A was shown to be important in the bortezomib?induced inhibitory effect on colon cancer.
