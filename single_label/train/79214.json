{"id":79214,"title":"Maxillary sinus atelectasis (silent sinus syndrome): treatment with balloon sinuplasty.","abstract":"Maxillary sinus atelectasis is a form of chronic rhinosinusitis of uncertain aetiology. Previously, the conventional treatment for this condition has been standard endoscopic surgery. There are no reports in the literature of successful treatment using balloon sinuplasty.A case of a patient with right maxillary sinus atelectasis is presented, who was treated using the balloon sinuplasty technique.The patient's right maxillary sinus atelectasis was successfully treated using balloon sinuplasty. Three-month follow-up evaluation documented retention of the remodelled form of the uncinate process, and of maxillary sinus os patency.This is the first report of successful use of the balloon sinuplasty technique for the treatment of maxillary sinus atelectasis. Follow up demonstrated resolution of the underlying pathophysiology. Further study of the balloon sinuplasty technique for the treatment of maxillary sinus atelectasis is required to determine whether it has widespread applicability, given the current standard treatment.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467806","annotations":[{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.818326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.797435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.693781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.617919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Maxillary sinus","weight":0.545064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_sinus"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.199711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.164226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Atelectasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelectasis"},{"name":"Uncinate process of ethmoid bone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncinate_process_of_ethmoid_bone"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Silent film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}]}
