{"id":37092,"title":"Relationship between insulin-like growth factor I levels, early insulin treatment, and clinical outcomes of very low birth weight infants.","abstract":"Insulin regulates the secretion of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in the newborn, and low levels of IGF-I have been linked to neonatal morbidity. As part of the Neonatal Insulin Replacement Therapy in Europe Trial, we investigated the impact of early insulin treatment on IGF-I levels and their relationship with morbidity and growth.Prospective cohort analyses of data collected as part of an international randomized controlled trial. Blood samples (days 1, 3, 7, and 28), were taken for IGF-I bioassay from 283 very low birth weight infants (<1500 g).Early insulin treatment led to a late increase in IGF-I levels between day 7 and 28 (P = .028). In the first week of life IGF-I levels were lower in infants with early hyperglycemia; mean difference -0.10 ?g/L (95% CI -0.19, -0.02, P = .02). Lower levels of IGF-I at day 28 were independently associated with an increased risk of chronic lung disease, OR 3.23 (95% CI, 1.09-9.10), and greater IGF-I levels were independently associated with better weight gain, 0.10 kg (95% CI, 0.03-0.33, P = .02).Early intervention with insulin is related to increased IGF-I levels at 28 days. Low IGF-I levels are associated with hyperglycemia, increased morbidity, and reduced growth. Increasing IGF-I levels may improve outcomes of very low birth weight infants.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518169","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.726011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.685517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.662436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.645783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.589911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.56163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.451356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.254651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Bioassay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioassay"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
