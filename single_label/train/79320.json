{"id":79320,"title":"The University of California Los Angeles Dizziness Questionnaire: advantages and disadvantages.","abstract":"Dizziness is one of the most troublesome symptoms of vestibular disorders, although its description remains somewhat imprecise, encompassing vertigo, lightheadedness, disequilibrium and giddiness. Symptoms include sensitivity to motion stimuli and discomfort with open spaces, such as empty streets and bridges. It is accompanied by varying degrees of anxiety and phobic behaviors. Several tools have been developed in an attempt to quantify the degree of disability, self-perceived health status and quality of life in patients with dizziness. This review focuses on the University of California, Los Angeles Dizziness Questionnaire (UCLA-DQ), which is used to assess the effect of dizziness on quality of life. This paper also includes a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the UCLA-DQ and compares it to other instruments used to assess dizziness. In spite of a few disadvantages, we believe that this multidimensional questionnaire is an appropriate tool for evaluating patients with vestibular impairment. It should be used during the acute phase of symptoms, as well as during and after rehabilitative therapy, to assess patient improvement.
