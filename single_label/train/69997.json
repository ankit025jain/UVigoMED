{"id":69997,"title":"Testing measurement invariance of the Chinese version of the Strategies Used by Patients to Promote Health among patients with cancer.","abstract":"The Chinese version of the Strategies Used by Patients to Promote Health (C-SUPPH) is a self-report instrument used to measure self-efficacy among patients with cancer. The purpose of this article is to examine measurement invariance of C-SUPPH using data of 764 cancer patients recruited in China.Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models were applied across the selected sociodemographic groups of gender, age, education, and monthly income levels.The factorial structure and factor loadings (relationships between items and their underlying factors) of C-SUPPH were invariant across all sociodemographic groups.The findings showed that the C-SUPPH measures the same latent constructs/factors in the same way when administered to different sociodemographic groups and thus can be readily applied to studying self-efficacy of cancer patients in China.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25255672","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.735704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"China","weight":0.620953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Factor analysis","weight":0.562585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis"},{"name":"Factorial","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Chinese language","weight":0.299204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.277943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.261748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.106265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Multigroup","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigroup"},{"name":"Confirmatory factor analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmatory_factor_analysis"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"764","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/764"},{"name":"Invariant (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
