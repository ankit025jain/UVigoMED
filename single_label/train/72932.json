{"id":72932,"title":"Cross-study validation for the assessment of prediction algorithms.","abstract":"Numerous competing algorithms for prediction in high-dimensional settings have been developed in the statistical and machine-learning literature. Learning algorithms and the prediction models they generate are typically evaluated on the basis of cross-validation error estimates in a few exemplary datasets. However, in most applications, the ultimate goal of prediction modeling is to provide accurate predictions for independent samples obtained in different settings. Cross-validation within exemplary datasets may not adequately reflect performance in the broader application context.We develop and implement a systematic approach to 'cross-study validation', to replace or supplement conventional cross-validation when evaluating high-dimensional prediction models in independent datasets. We illustrate it via simulations and in a collection of eight estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer microarray gene-expression datasets, where the objective is predicting distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). We computed the C-index for all pairwise combinations of training and validation datasets. We evaluate several alternatives for summarizing the pairwise validation statistics, and compare these to conventional cross-validation.Our data-driven simulations and our application to survival prediction with eight breast cancer microarray datasets, suggest that standard cross-validation produces inflated discrimination accuracy for all algorithms considered, when compared to cross-study validation. Furthermore, the ranking of learning algorithms differs, suggesting that algorithms performing best in cross-validation may be suboptimal when evaluated through independent validation.The survHD: Survival in High Dimensions package (http://www.bitbucket.org/lwaldron/survhd) will be made available through Bioconductor.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24931973","annotations":[{"name":"Machine learning","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.482994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.391224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.388943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.384444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Bioconductor","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioconductor"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.32572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.287046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.281543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.207822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Reinforcement learning","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0768603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Bitbucket","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitbucket"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Convention (norm)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"R (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Ranking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Verification and validation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation"}]}
