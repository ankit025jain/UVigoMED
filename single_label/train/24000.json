{"id":24000,"title":"Helicobacter pylori Infection and the risk of colorectal adenoma and adenocarcinoma: an updated meta-analysis of different testing methods.","abstract":"Helicobacter pylori infection may be associated with an increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. However, as most studies on this subject were relatively small in size and differed at least partially in their designs, their results remain controversial. In this study, we aimed to carry out a meta-analysis to evaluate the potential association of H. pylori infection with colorectal adenoma and adenocarcinoma risk, covering all of the different testing methods.We conducted a search in PubMed, Medline, EBSCO, High Wire Press, OVID, and EMBASE covering all published papers up to March 2013. According to the established inclusion criteria, essential data were then extracted from the included studies and further analyzed by a systematic meta-analysis. Odds ratios were employed to evaluate the relationship between H. pylori infection and the risk of colorectal neoplasms.Twenty-two studies were included, and the odds ratio for the association between H. pylori infection and colorectal cancer was 1.49 (95% confidence interval 1.30-1.72). No statistically significant heterogeneity was observed. Publication bias was ruled out.The pooled data suggest H. pylori infection indeed increases the risk of colorectal adenoma and adenocarcinoma.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460342","annotations":[{"name":"Publication bias","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.842185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.739153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.700551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.693902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.437478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.325461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.288203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.137683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"EBSCO Industries","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBSCO_Industries"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Wire (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_(band)"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Mini-Con","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-Con"}]}
