{"id":47470,"title":"Functional polymorphisms in interleukin-23 receptor and susceptibility to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Chinese population.","abstract":"As a key element in the T-helper 17 (Th17) cell-mediated inflammatory process, interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cancer. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-23R have been frequently studied in several previous case-control cancer studies, but its association with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in Chinese population has not been investigated. This study examined whether genetic polymorphisms in IL-23R were associated with ESCC susceptibility.A hospital-based case-control study of 684 ESCC patients and 1064 healthy controls was performed to assess the association between four previous reported IL-23R genotypes (rs6682925, rs6683039, rs1884444 and rs10889677) and ESCC risk. The results revealed that the C allele of the rs10889677A>C polymorphism in the 3'UTR of IL-23R gene was inversely associated with the risk of ESCC.The rs10889677AC genotype had significantly decreased cancer risk (odds ratio [OR]? = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] ?= 0.69-1.01) compared to subjects homozygous carriers of rs10889677AA, the risk decreased even further in those carrying rs10889677CC genotype (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.44-0.93). No significant association was found between the other three polymorphisms and the risk of ESCC.These findings indicated that rs10889677A>C polymorphism in IL-23R may play a protective role in mediating the risk of ESCC.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586528","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.844756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.826303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.798844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.754053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.745661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.467347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.297391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"China","weight":0.140815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Interleukin 23","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_23"},{"name":"R gene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_gene"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"}]}
