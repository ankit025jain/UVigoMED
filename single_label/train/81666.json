{"id":81666,"title":"Immediate loading of two flapless placed mandibular implants supporting cross-arch fixed prostheses: a 3-year follow-up prospective single cohort study.","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical outcome of two implants placed flapless in fully edentulous mandibles and immediately restored with a metal-resin screw-retained cross-arch prostheses 3 years after loading.Eighty consecutively patients were recruited. Implants for immediate loading had to be inserted with a minimum torque of 80 Ncm. Outcome measures, evaluated by two independent assessors, were: prosthesis and implant failures, complications, marginal bone level changes, implant stability quotient (ISQ) values and patient satisfaction.Three years after loading, all prostheses were in function although one patient did not come back for the 1- and 3-year follow-ups. Two implants failed early in two patients, but were successfully replaced and their prostheses remade. Twelve complications occurred in 10 patients but were all successfully treated. After 3 years, mean marginal bone loss was 0.43 mm, mean ISQ values decreased from 75.4 to 75.3, and all but four patients were fully satisfied with the therapy. Four patients were partially satisfied because, lacking molars, they could not chew as they wished.Immediately loaded mandibular cross-arch partial dentures can be supported by only two dental implants up to 3 years. Longer follow-ups (around 10 years) are needed to know the prognosis of this treatment modality.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24892116","annotations":[{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.686433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.657734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.634501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.615348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Removable partial denture","weight":0.348425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removable_partial_denture"},{"name":"Torque","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Immediate Records","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_Records"},{"name":"Assessor (Italy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assessor_(Italy)"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Longer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longer"}]}
