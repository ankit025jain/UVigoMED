{"id":26236,"title":"[Annuloplasty ring and band for valve repair].","abstract":"Annulus dilatation is present in almost all patients with mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation. Therefore annuloplasty is required to obtain normal leaflet coaptation. Annuloplasty ring or band offers more stability in valve repair, improving long-term outcome. Since annuloplasty ring and band of various types can be used, to understand the characteristics and to select proper size are important.
