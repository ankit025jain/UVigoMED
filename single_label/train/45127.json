{"id":45127,"title":"Whites and blacks have similar risk of metachronous advanced colorectal neoplasia.","abstract":"Current guidelines for surveillance of colonic neoplasia are based on data from predominantly white populations, yet whether these recommendations are applicable to blacks is unknown.To define the prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACN) among whites and blacks undergoing surveillance colonoscopy.This was a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of asymptomatic, average-risk non-Hispanic white (N = 246) and non-Hispanic black (N = 203) patients with colorectal neoplasia who underwent baseline screening colonoscopy between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2007, and a surveillance colonoscopy before December 31, 2010, at an academic safety-net hospital. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of ACN, defined as a tubular adenoma or sessile serrated adenoma (SSA) ? 10 mm, any adenoma with villous histology or high-grade dysplasia, any serrated lesion with dysplasia, or invasive cancer at surveillance.During a median follow-up of 4.3 years, the overall prevalence of ACN at surveillance was similar among blacks and whites (11.3 vs. 9.8 %; P = 0.59) with an odds ratio of 1.18 (95 % CI 0.65-2.16) [corrected]. Blacks and whites with non-advanced neoplasia had similar rates of ACN at the 1-3, 4-5, and >5 year follow-up intervals. Blacks with ACN or multiplicity at baseline had higher rates of ACN at the 1- to 3-year interval compared with whites, but the difference was non-significant (26.7 vs. 12.5 %; P = 0.32). No interval cancers were observed for either group.The overall prevalence of ACN was similar between non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites undergoing surveillance in a safety-net healthcare setting suggesting that current surveillance guidelines are appropriate for both blacks and whites.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Digestive System
