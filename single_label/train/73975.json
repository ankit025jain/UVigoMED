{"id":73975,"title":"Perseveration found in a human drawing task: six-fingered hands drawn by patients with right anterior insula and operculum damage.","abstract":"Perseveration has been observed in a number of behavioural contexts, including speaking, writing, and drawing. However, no previous report describes patients who show perseveration only for drawing a human figure.The present report describes a group of patients who show body awareness-related cognitive impairment during a human figure drawing task, a different presentation from previously described neuropsychological cases.Participants were 15 patients who had a frontal lobe brain tumour around the insula cortex of the right hemisphere and had subsequently undergone a neurosurgical resective operation. Participants were asked to draw a human figure in both \"hands-down\" and \"hands-up\" configurations.Eight of the 15 patients drew a human figure with six fingers during the \"hands-up\" and the \"hands-down\" human figure drawing tasks (one patient drew eight fingers). A statistical analysis of potential lesion areas revealed damage to the right anterior frontal insula and operculum in this group of patients relative to the five-finger drawing group.Our findings reveal a newly described neuropsychological phenomenon that could reflect impairment in attention directed towards body representations.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24876665","annotations":[{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cerebral hemisphere","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Neuropsychology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Brain tumor","weight":0.704907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Perseveration","weight":0.598784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseveration"},{"name":"Writing","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Insular cortex","weight":0.471151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_cortex"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.353733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.222499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.102441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Drawing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing"},{"name":"Polydactyly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydactyly"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
