{"id":4742,"title":"Caries experience and treatment needs among Albanian 12-year-olds.","abstract":"To determine the dental caries experience and treatment needs among 12-year-olds in Albania.This 2011 cross sectional survey used cluster sampling with DMFT and SiC indexes used to assess dental caries experience; DT/DMFT to assess untreated caries; FT/DMFT the care index and MT/DMFT as missing index.1928 12-year-olds selected from state schools across 16 local districts with a mix of urban and rural areas and contrasting socio-economic groups.WHO protocols were used.The caries prevalence (DMFT > 0) was 87% (95%CI 85.6,88.4) and 29.6% were without cavitated carious lesions (DT = 0). The mean caries experience (DMFT) was 3.73 (sd 2.71) for boys, 3.71 (sd 2.61, p = 0.88) for girls and 3.72 (sd 2.66) overall. The caries treatment needs DT/DMFT was 56% (sd 0.36), the mean FT/DMFT (Care Index) was 31% (sd 0.34) and the mean SiC index was 6.72 (sd 1.92).Dental caries experience and untreated dental caries were high compared with 12-year-olds in most European Union Member States. This suggests an urgent need for a national preventive program and improved access to oral care for this age group.","date":"2014-10-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25300147","annotations":[{"name":"European Union","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Albania","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.548886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.329622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Member state of the European Union","weight":0.270016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.185256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.178263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cluster sampling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_sampling"},{"name":"Albanian language","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Digital television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_television"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"1928","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1928"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Cluster bomb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_bomb"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Cross-sectional study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study"},{"name":"Districts of Peru","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Peru"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Oral medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_medicine"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Silicon","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon"}]}
