{"id":76246,"title":"Blood lipids affect rat islet blood flow regulation through ??-adrenoceptors.","abstract":"Pancreatic islet blood perfusion varies according to the needs for insulin secretion. We examined the effects of blood lipids on pancreatic islet blood flow in anesthetized rats. Acute administration of Intralipid to anesthetized rats increased both triglycerides and free fatty acids, associated with a simultaneous increase in total pancreatic and islet blood flow. A preceding abdominal vagotomy markedly potentiated this and led acutely to a 10-fold increase in islet blood flow associated with a similar increase in serum insulin concentrations. The islet blood flow and serum insulin response could be largely prevented by pretreatment with propranolol and the selective ??-adrenergic inhibitor SR-59230A. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester prevented the blood flow increase but was less effective in reducing serum insulin. Increased islet blood flow after Intralipid administration was also seen in islet and whole pancreas transplanted rats, i.e., models with different degrees of chronic islet denervation, but the effect was not as pronounced. In isolated vascularly perfused single islets Intralipid dilated islet arterioles, but this was not affected by SR-59230A. Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system are important for the coordination of islet blood flow and insulin release during hyperlipidemia, with a previously unknown role for ??-adrenoceptors.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139049","annotations":[{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Parasympathetic nervous system","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Ester","weight":0.871618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Propranolol","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propranolol"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.790158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.765422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Adrenergic receptor","weight":0.737176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor"},{"name":"Arteriole","weight":0.717091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriole"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.666615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.64351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.589984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.515539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.34327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.312082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.295179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.283838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.112059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"}]}
