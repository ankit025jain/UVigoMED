{"id":88783,"title":"Pathogenesis of post-traumatic OA with a view to intervention.","abstract":"Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) subsequent to joint injury accounts for over 12% of the overall disease burden of OA, and higher in the most at-risk ankle and knee joints. Evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of PTOA may be related to inflammatory processes and alterations to the articular cartilage, menisci, muscle and subchondral bone that are initiated in the acute post-injury phase. Imaging of these early changes, as well as a number of biochemical markers, demonstrates the potential for use as predictors of future disease, and may help stratify patients on the likelihood of their developing clinical disease. This will be important in guiding future interventions, which will likely target elements of the inflammatory response within the joint, molecular abnormalities related to cartilage matrix degradation, chondrocyte function and subchondral bone remodelling. Until significant improvements are made, however, in identifying patients most at risk for developing PTOA--and therefore those who are candidates for therapy--primary prevention programmes will remain the most effective current management tools.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792943","annotations":[{"name":"Epiphysis","weight":0.890987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphysis"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.872094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Chondrocyte","weight":0.79695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrocyte"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.660502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.617802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.553394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.538034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.489279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.45573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.375585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.25753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Meniscus (anatomy)","weight":0.0248947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Process (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Biomarker (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"}]}
