{"id":35708,"title":"Glycerol phenylbutyrate treatment in children with urea cycle disorders: pooled analysis of short and long-term ammonia control and outcomes.","abstract":"To evaluate glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB) in the treatment of pediatric patients with urea cycle disorders (UCDs).UCD patients (n=26) ages 2months through 17years were treated with GPB and sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPBA) in two short-term, open-label crossover studies, which compared 24-hour ammonia exposure (AUC0-24) and glutamine levels during equivalent steady-state dosing of GPB and sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPBA). These 26 patients plus an additional 23 patients also received GPB in one of three 12-month, open label extension studies, which assessed long-term ammonia control, hyperammonemic (HA) crises, amino acid levels, and patient growth.Mean ammonia exposure on GPB was non-inferior to NaPBA in each of the individual crossover studies. In the pooled analyses, it was significantly lower on GPB vs. NaPBA (mean [SD] AUC0-24: 627 [302] vs. 872 [516] ?mol/L; p=0.008) with significantly fewer abnormal values (15% on GPB vs. 35% on NaPBA; p=0.02). Mean ammonia levels remained within the normal range during 12months of GPB dosing and, when compared with the 12months preceding enrollment, a smaller percentage of patients (24.5% vs. 42.9%) experienced fewer (17 vs. 38) HA crises. Glutamine levels tended to be lower with GPB than with NaPBA during short-term dosing (mean [SD]: 660.8 [164.4] vs. 710.0 [158.7] ?mol/L; p=0.114) and mean glutamine and branched chain amino acid levels, as well as other essential amino acids, remained within the normal range during 12months of GPB dosing. Mean height and weight Z-scores were within normal range at baseline and did not change significantly during 12months of GPB treatment.Dosing with GPB was associated with 24-hour ammonia exposure that was non-inferior to that during dosing with NaPBA in individual studies and significantly lower in the pooled analysis. Long-term GPB dosing was associated with normal levels of glutamine and essential amino acids, including branched chain amino acids, age-appropriate growth and fewer HA crises as compared with the 12month period preceding enrollment.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630270","annotations":[{"name":"Glycerol","weight":0.900742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Ammonia","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"},{"name":"Urea cycle","weight":0.812907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_cycle"},{"name":"Glutamine","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.797668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.598115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.495077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Essential amino acid","weight":0.473771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_amino_acid"},{"name":"Urea cycle disorder","weight":0.436682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_cycle_disorder"},{"name":"Branched-chain amino acid","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branched-chain_amino_acid"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Georgia Public Broadcasting","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Public_Broadcasting"},{"name":"Open-label trial","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-label_trial"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"710","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/710"},{"name":"627","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/627"},{"name":"872","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/872"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Record label","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label"},{"name":"Biogeochemical cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycle"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Acids in wine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acids_in_wine"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Dosing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosing"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Sodium phenylbutyrate","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_phenylbutyrate"},{"name":"Chromosomal crossover","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover"}]}
