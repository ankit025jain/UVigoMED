{"id":83805,"title":"[Dynamics of activity of neurokinine receptors and enzymes of intercellular matrix (MMP9 and TIMP-2) in the nasal mucosa of the chronic cigarette smokers].","abstract":"The present study was designed to determine localization of substance P and neuroknine receptors in the nasal mucous membrane of the subjects having the history of chronic smoking. The mechanisms underlying reorganization of the mucous tissue were elucidated by measuring the activity of intercellular matrix enzymes (MMP9 and TIMP-2). The activity of neurokinine receptors localized on the cells of ciliary epithelium and in the connective tissue elements of the submucous structures was shown to be significantly increased. It is concluded that the specific dynamics of MMP9 and TIMP-2 activities in the chronic cigarette smokers indicates that the matrix metalloproteinases of this type play an important role in the structural reorganization of the tissues of the nasal mucous membrane.
