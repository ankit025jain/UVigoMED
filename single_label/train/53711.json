{"id":53711,"title":"[Pancreatic resection using laparoscopic access].","abstract":"Experience of their own on performance of pancreatic resection interventions, using laparoscopic access, conducted in the clinic in 2009 - 2013 yrs, was presented. In 8 patients laparoscopic distal pancreatic resection was conducted, in 5--laparoscopic enucleation of pancreatic tumor, in 1--laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenal resection. The results were compared with such after open operations, performed in this period of time. There was not a trustworthy difference in the postoperative complications rate, intraoperative blood loss severity and the distal resection duration. The patient stationary treatment duration was trustworthy less after conduction of laparoscopic operations. The intraoperative blood loss severity and duration of laparoscopic enucleation of pancreatic tumor are trustworthy less.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501978","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.602943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.369795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.249429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.23036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.213318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.115315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Steady state","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state"}]}
