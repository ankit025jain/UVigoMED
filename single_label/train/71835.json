{"id":71835,"title":"Postmastectomy radiation therapy after immediate two-stage tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction: a University of British Columbia perspective.","abstract":"An increasing number of women who undergo immediate two-stage tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction will require postmastectomy radiation therapy. An important variable is the timing of radiotherapy relative to surgery. The authors report their experience treating a large consecutive series of patients who underwent postmastectomy radiation therapy to the tissue expander before exchange for a permanent implant.Patients who had their tissue expander irradiated before implant exchange were identified. Complications, capsular contracture, revision surgery, and autologous salvage rates of irradiated patients were compared with a control group of nonirradiated patients.Immediate two-stage tissue expander/implant reconstruction was initiated in 604 patients, with 113 irradiated breasts meeting inclusion criteria. Three hundred thirty-nine nonirradiated breasts constituted the control group. There was a 4.2 increased odds of major complications in the irradiated group, after adjusting for plastic surgeon, age, body mass index, smoking, chemotherapy, and cancerous breast (OR, 4.2; p=0.001). The grade III and IV capsular contracture rate was significantly higher in the irradiated group compared with the control group (21.7 percent versus 10 percent; p<0.008). The revision rate in the control group was higher compared with the irradiated group (30.2 percent versus 20.9 percent; p<0.001).Postmastectomy irradiation to the tissue expander is associated with high complications; however, these patients have an acceptable capsular contracture rate that compares favorably with other implant-based radiotherapy algorithms. Revision rates were less than expected in irradiated breasts. This study suggests that immediate tissue expander/implant reconstruction is a reasonable surgical option in the setting of postmastectomy radiation therapy.Therapeutic, III.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25028850","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue expansion","weight":0.892817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_expansion"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Breast reconstruction","weight":0.72518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reconstruction"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.717506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.650688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.606142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.534441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.48582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.432977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.345291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.335303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.331511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.255984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Capsular contracture","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsular_contracture"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.204946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"University of British Columbia","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Columbia University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Internal combustion engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine"},{"name":"Income tax","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax"},{"name":"Editing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Paganism (contemporary religions)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism_(contemporary_religions)"}]}
