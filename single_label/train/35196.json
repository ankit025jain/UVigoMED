{"id":35196,"title":"Novel two-stage surgical treatment for Cantrell syndrome complicated by severe pulmonary hypertension: a case report.","abstract":"Cantrell syndrome is a rare syndrome of congenital defects, which can be complicated by severe pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular diverticulum; it has proved difficult to treat in clinical practice.A 6-month-old Han Chinese baby girl weighing 3.5 kg was diagnosed, using ultrasonography and radiography, as having Cantrell syndrome complicated by severe pulmonary hypertension. For safety, we divided management into two stages. For the first stage, we dealt with the left ventricular diverticulum and pulmonary hypertension. Three months later, we performed diorthosis for an intracardiac malformation.Cantrell syndrome with pulmonary hypertension may respond well to this novel two-stage operation, which needs more verification via clinical practice.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669878","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.714271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.693722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.691293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"China","weight":0.464223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.306756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.157444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.120615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Diverticulum","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulum"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0291129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Han Dynasty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Dynasty"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"}]}
