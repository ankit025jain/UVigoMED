{"id":85728,"title":"[Genetic predisposition to ischemic heart disease in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)].","abstract":"The incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in patients with OSAS is estimated at around 20%. This greatly affect a common risk factors for both diseases: male gender, obesity, age and diabetes and hypertension. Attention is drawn to the possibility of genetic determinants of IHD. The aim of study was to answer the question whether the presence of polymorphisms of selected genes possibly related to IHD may be useful to isolate the group of patients with OSAS, especially vulnerable as a complication of IHD. Materials and methods. The study included 600 people with OSAS, which was isolated in patients with IHD (127 people). The remaining 473 individuals were observed as a control group. The polymorphism of three genes were evaluated to find possible influence on the occurrence of IHD or myocardial infarction as follows: SREBF1 (sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1), REBF2 (sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2) and HIF1 (hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit). Results. Analysis of relationship between polymorphisms of selected genes and the diagnosis of IHD in the whole group of patients with OSAS showed a relationship only for the gene SREBF1 finding the lowest frequency of its occurrence in AA homozygotes (at 13.6%) and twice with GG homozygotes (26.1%). Conclusions. Rating polymorphisms studied genes did not reveal their relationship to the occurrence of IHD in patients with OSAS, both in the whole group as well as separate subgroups.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24868893","annotations":[{"name":"Ischaemic heart
