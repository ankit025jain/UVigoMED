{"id":4981,"title":"[Arthroscopic repair of meniscus injury with Fast-fix under local anesthesia].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical outcome of arthroscopic repair method of meniscus injury with Fast-fix under local anesthesia.From October 2005 to September 2012,106 patients with meniscus injuries admitted into our - hospital were studied, including 74 males and 32 females, ranging in age from 13 to 71 years old, averaged 27.6 years old. The duration of the disease ranged from 15 days to 5 years. The main clinical manifestations included knee joint pain after exercise, joint locking, pressing pain of knee joint and positive McMurray signs. The MRI showed meniscus tear or degeneration. Arthroscopic repairing surgeries were performed with Fast-fix under local anesthesia. Each patient was assessed with VAS pain evaluation and Lysholm knee-joint score system before and after operation. All the patients were followed up more than 1 year.One hundred and 2 patients were followed up by recording subjective symptoms, clinical examinations and questions naires for an average of 2.6 years (ranged, 1.1 to 8 years), and 4 patients lost follow-up. All the 102 patients had no anesthetic complications. Ninety-six patients had normal subjective symptom and clinical examinations. Four patients had a mild ache with activities,2 patients had moderate pain after activities with joint space pressing pain. VAS pain evaluation and Lysholm knee-joint score after operation both were much better than that before operation.onclusion: Local anesthesia can provide nice circumstances for surgeries. Arthroscopic repair using Fast-fix is an idea method for meniscus injury, especially for the posterior horn tear of medial meniscus, which is simple and convenient with less complications, and satisfactory results.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464596","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.749179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.645646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.630746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.627372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.563822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.263867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Arthralgia","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthralgia"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Meniscus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus"},{"name":"Posterior horn of spinal cord","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_horn_of_spinal_cord"},{"name":"Medial meniscus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_meniscus"},{"name":"Tear of meniscus","weight":0.0276285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_of_meniscus"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Joint lock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_lock"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Joint locking (symptom)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_locking_(symptom)"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
