{"id":89840,"title":"Clinical features and treatment outcomes of skin cancer arising from burn scar: a single-institution experience.","abstract":"This study was conducted to investigate the clinicopathological features and long-term outcomes of patients with skin cancer arising from burn scar (SCBS).We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with SCBS between January 2000 and May 2012. A total of 44 patients were enrolled in this study.The median latent period between burn injury and development of SCBS was 32 years (range, 8-78 years). The most frequent sites of SCBS were the lower limbs (68.2%) followed by the upper limbs (15.9%) and trunk (11.4%). Most patients (95.4%) had squamous cell carcinoma. Of 34 patients with localized disease at the time of diagnosis, 33 patients are alive with no evidence of recurrence. Of 10 patients with regional lymph node metastasis (referred to as locally advanced disease), 4 died of disease progression and 5 are alive with metastatic disease in the lymph nodes, bone or lung. Patients with localized disease survived longer than patients with locally advanced disease ( P = 0.000). In patients with locally advanced disease, the median overall survival time was 16 months (95% CI, 2.88-29.4 months).While localized SCBS is a potentially curable disease, locally advanced SCBS has a poor prognosis in spite of aggressive treatment. These results suggest that early recognition and aggressive treatment are essential to improve the outcomes of SCBS.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675487","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.754841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.655043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.588224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.475769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.354409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.281649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.269954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
