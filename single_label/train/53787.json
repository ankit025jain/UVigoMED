{"id":53787,"title":"The role of TNF-? G-308A promoter polymorphism in glycemic control in Type 2 diabetes patients.","abstract":"TNF-? polymorphisms were shown to be associated with insulin resistance and diabetes development and complications.To investigate the association between glycemic control in Type 2 diabetes patients and TNF-? G-308A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).This was a cross-sectional observational study, where diabetes patients from both genders (170 male and 185 female) were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: good glycemic control (n = 158) and poor glycemic control (n = 197). Genotyping of TNF-? G-308A SNP was carried out using restriction fragment length polymorphisms-polymerase chain reaction.The results showed that TNF-? G-308A SNP is strongly associated with glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients. Patients with the AA and AG genotypes had better glycemic control than those with GG genotype (P < 0.01). Other parameters that impacted glycemic control include duration of the disease (P < 0.01) and response to insulin therapy (P < 0.01). However, no contribution for gender or statins use to glycemic control was observed (P > 0.05).TNF-? G-308A SNP might modulate glycemic control among type 2 diabetes patients.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24497209","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.88878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.840498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.753881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.643164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.625701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.557152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.535353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.144121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.131231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.118068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Insulin therapy","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_therapy"}]}
