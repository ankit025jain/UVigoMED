{"id":92225,"title":"'Toy' laser macular burns in children.","abstract":"Laser 'toys' can be purchased online and imported with relative ease; the variety of such devices is a potential public safety concern. We describe five children with maculopathy following exposure to laser 'toys'.Case series of maculopathy following exposure to laser 'toys'.Five children were seen in our Ophthalmic Unit with macular injuries following exposure to laser 'toys'. Clinically, three children had an acute vitelliform-like maculopathy which resolved to leave sub-foveal retinal pigment epithelium changes with reduced vision. One case was complicated by a choroidal neovascular membrane.Laser 'toys', which resemble laser pointers, are increasingly available over the internet. Such 'toys' may not meet safety standards. Retinal injury in childhood following exposure to laser 'toys' is a public safety concern.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434663","annotations":[{"name":"Laser","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.775133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.702753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.483118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.363573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.320678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.232227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Toy","weight":0.119641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Choroidal neovascularization","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroidal_neovascularization"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Pointer (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computing)"},{"name":"Safety standards","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_standards"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Public safety","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_safety"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Maculopathy","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maculopathy"}]}
