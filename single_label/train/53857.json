{"id":53857,"title":"Significant positive relationship between serum magnesium and muscle quality in maintenance hemodialysis patients.","abstract":"Serum magnesium (Mg) levels have been associated with muscle performance in the general population. We hypothesized that serum Mg would be associated with muscle quality in hemodialysis patients.A total of 310 patients were examined (age: 58 ± 12 years, hemodialysis duration: 6.4 ± 6.0 years, 60.6% men, and 36.1% diabetics). Arm lean mass was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) on the dominant side. Arm muscle quality was defined as the ratio of the handgrip strength to the arm lean mass of the same side (kg/kg).Serum Mg was 1.15 ± 0.16 mmol/L (2.8 ± 0.4 mg/dL), being higher than the reference range of normal subjects. There was a significant negative correlation between muscle quality and age (r = -0.326, p<0.0001) and duration of hemodialysis (r = -0.253, p<0.0001). The muscle quality of the diabetics was significantly lower than that of the non-diabetics (p<0.001). There was a significant, positive correlation between muscle quality and serum Mg (r = 0.118, p<0.05), but not serum calcium or phosphate. In multiple regression analysis, age, gender, hemodialysis duration, diabetes, and serum Mg (? = 0.129, p<0.05) were significantly and independently associated with muscle quality (R(2) = 0.298, p<0.0001).These results demonstrated that a lower serum Mg concentration was significantly associated with poor muscle quality in hemodialysis patients. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanism by which lower serum Mg affects muscle quality.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491526","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.555845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.490218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.454215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.430845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.40336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.346317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.342096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.318736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.191559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.0562242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.0409614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Reference ranges for blood tests","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests"},{"name":"Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"253","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/253"},{"name":"298","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/298"},{"name":"310","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/310"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"R (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Direct relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_relationship"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Mechanism (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(engineering)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Minuscule 326","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_326"}]}
