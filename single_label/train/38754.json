{"id":38754,"title":"Fast track occlusion of aorta with atrial septal defect sizing balloon.","abstract":"We describe the case of a 57-year-old woman referred to our emergency service with ruptured abdominal aneurysm. We placed a 34-mm Amplatzer sizing balloon II into the suprarenal level of aorta to immediately control the active massive bleeding and to get the patient out of hemorrhage shock into the stable condition. After the bleeding control, endovascular repair was successfully performed. This is the first case report, to our knowledge, of atrial septal defect (ASD) sizing balloon use for blocking the blood flow through aorta to control the bleeding. ASD sizing balloon has some different properties compared to aortic occlusion balloon catheter (AOBC). Due to availability of sheathless usage, ASD sizing balloon may be preferred over AOBC for some of patient groups with peripheral artery diseases and small femoral artery diameters.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24403245","annotations":[{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Femoral artery","weight":0.827129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_artery"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.784822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Abdominal aortic aneurysm","weight":0.620849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Balloon catheter","weight":0.53831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_catheter"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.488503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.283737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.268114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Emergency bleeding control","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_bleeding_control"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Track and field","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"}]}
