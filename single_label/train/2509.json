{"id":2509,"title":"[Evolutionary perspective in precocious puberty].","abstract":"Pubertal development is subject to substantial heritability, but much variation remains to be explained, including fast changes over the last 150 years, that cannot be explained by changes of gene frequency in the population. This article discusses the influence of environmental factors to adjust maturational tempo in the service of fitness goals. Utilizing evolutionary development thinking (evo-devo), the author examines adolescence as an evolutionary life-history stage in its developmental context. The transition from the preceding stage of juvenility entails adaptive plasticity in response to energy resources, social needs of adolescence and maturation toward youth and adulthood. Using Belsky's evolutionary theory of socialization, I show that familial psychosocial environment during the infancy-childhood and childhood-juvenility transitions foster a fast life-history and reproductive strategy rather than early maturation being just a risk factor for aggression and delinquency. The implications of the evo-devo framework for theory building, illuminates new directions in the understanding of precocious puberty other than a diagnosis of a disease.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518076","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Fitness (biology)","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology)"},{"name":"Heritability","weight":0.829254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Socialization","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.704585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.676335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.45775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.371201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.320678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.315911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.243345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.241683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Juvenile delinquency","weight":0.151875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_delinquency"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.128276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Evolutionary developmental biology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Precocious puberty","weight":0.090579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocious_puberty"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Allele frequency","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0244835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Sexual maturity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity"},{"name":"Tempo","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo"},{"name":"Neuroplasticity","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"}]}
