{"id":77966,"title":"Eustachian tube function in young children without a history of otitis media evaluated using a pressure chamber protocol.","abstract":"Protocol limitations were identified and accounted for in the analysis. Percent gradient equilibrated (PGE) was affected by driving gradient direction in a similar manner to other efficiency measures. A finer resolution of possible age-related changes in eustachian tube opening efficiency is expected with the application of more sophisticated statistical models to the complete dataset at study end.To report the results of an interim analysis for an ongoing study designed to characterize the age-related changes in eustachian tube opening efficiency measured using a pressure chamber protocol in children without a history of middle ear disease.To date, 41 children aged 3 years without a history of otitis media have been enrolled in a longitudinal study of the age-related changes in eustachian tube function and evaluated at yearly intervals between 3 and 7 years of age. Eustachian tube opening efficiency, the percent of the applied pressure gradient equilibrated by swallowing, was measured by repeat tympanometry during a pressure chamber protocol. Data (120 tests) were analyzed using an ANOVA with variance partitioned by age (3 through 6 years), gradient direction (positive/negative), and ear (left/right).PGE was higher for left ears and positive driving gradients, but was not different among age groups.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828350","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.158256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Statistical model","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Tympanometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanometry"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Chemical equilibrium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium"},{"name":"Driving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Pressure vessel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_vessel"},{"name":"Granularity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Interim","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Swallowing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing"},{"name":"Partition of a set","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Microphone","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone"}]}
