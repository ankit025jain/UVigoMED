{"id":62866,"title":"Inflammatory pseudotumor-like follicular dendritic cell tumor of liver and spleen: granulomatous and eosinophil-rich variants mimicking inflammatory or infective lesions.","abstract":"Inflammatory pseudotumor-like follicular dendritic cell (FDC) tumor is an uncommon, Epstein-Barr virus-associated neoplasm of the liver or spleen, characterized by spindly tumor cells dispersed in a background of small lymphocytes and plasma cells. We report 6 diagnostically challenging cases in which the neoplastic component is further overshadowed by granulomas or eosinophils. The patients included 2 men and 4 women with a median age of 45.5 years, and 1 of them showed concurrent involvement of the liver and spleen. The presence of extensive coalescent epithelioid granulomas in 3 splenic tumors and 3 liver tumors raised the possibilities of an infective process or sarcoidosis. In another liver tumor, the massive infiltrate of eosinophils, accompanied by geographic eosinophilic abscesses, suggested parasitic infestation or so-called eosinophilic granuloma of the liver. However, scrutiny of the tissue between the granulomas or among the eosinophils revealed scattered atypical spindly cells with indistinct cell borders, large vesicular nuclei, and distinct nucleoli. The atypical cells were positive for FDC markers on immunostaining (CD21, CD35) and Epstein-Barr virus on in situ hybridization. Thus, a diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor-like FDC tumor could be confirmed. Awareness of the granulomatous and eosinophil-rich variants of this tumor type will facilitate the correct diagnosis to be made.
