{"id":37953,"title":"From bare to covered: 15-year single center experience and follow-up in trans-catheter stent implantation for aortic coarctation.","abstract":"Bare stents has become the first line therapy for aortic coarctation. Covered stents has been reported more recently in clinical practice.The present study, reports comparatively 15-year experience of bare and covered stent implantation for aortic coarctation in a single tertiary referral center.From 1997 to 2011, 143 patients with native or postoperative aortic coarctation were treated at our institution. Seventy-one subjects (median age 17 years (range from 4 to 70 years) underwent bare stent implantation (Group 1) while 72 patients (median age of 17.5 years (range from 6 to 68 years) underwent covered stent implantation (Group 2).Success rate in the whole group was 95%. More complex and tighter coarctations were treated using covered stents. Incidence of related-procedure adverse events was higher in Group 1 than in group 2 (21.1% vs. 8.3% P?=?0.035). Aortic wall complications occurred in 7% of patients in Group 1 (one death) and 0% in Group 2 (P?=?0.028). Subjects in Group 1 had a longer follow-up (median 85 vs. 35 months; P?<?0.001). Independent predictors associated with reintervention included the presence of complex lesions (HR: 2.70; CI: 1.15-6.32), balloon diameter used <14 mm (HR: 3.76; CI: 1.48-9.55), and immediate residual gradient >10 mm Hg (HR: 4.30; CI: 1.96-9.47).Both bare and covered stent implantation for aortic coarctation is a safe and efficacious treatment. By using covered stent implantation the spectrum of patients treated has increased with lower rates of acute and late complications.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459104","annotations":[{"name":"Stent","weight":0.692342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.466913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.403857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.356148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.329301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Coarctation of the aorta","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarctation_of_the_aorta"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"969","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/969"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0136408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"}]}
