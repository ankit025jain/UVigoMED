{"id":46013,"title":"The role of RCAS1 as a biomarker in diagnosing CRC and monitoring tumor recurrence and metastasis.","abstract":"Receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells (RCAS1) plays an important role in tumor progression by helping tumor cell to escape from host immunological surveillance or modifying the characteristics of connective tissue around. RCAS1 may appropriately reflect the development and prognosis of tumor. In the study, we sought to identify the clinical significance of RCAS1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis and tumor recurrence monitoring. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with tissue array slides was preformed to analyze RCAS1 protein expression in CRC, colorectal polyps, and normal colon tissues. RCAS1 levels in colorectal cancer were significantly higher than those in colorectal polyps and normal colon tissues (P<0.001). Silencing RCAS1 gene in human colonic adenocarcinoma cells decreased cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis through the p53 signaling pathway. Further analysis by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that serum RCAS1 levels in CRC are significantly higher than in healthy controls and polyps (P<0.05), in which the highest serum RCAS1 level is reported in the recurrence group. The serum RCAS1 levels have a significant correlation with clinical stage and pathologic grading. Furthermore, the positive rate of serum RCAS1 in CRC was 82.1 %, which was higher than carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Especially in CEA-negative cases, the sensitivity of RCAS1 was 88.2 %. Finally, CRC patients who were followed up showed a serum RCAS1 level which significantly decreased after surgery (P<0.001) and obviously increased in the recurrence group. Taken together, our data demonstrated that RCAS1 is not only a supplementary serological biomarker for CRC diagnosis but also useful for monitoring tumor recurrence. RCAS1 might be a supplementary serological marker for CRC.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Digestive System
