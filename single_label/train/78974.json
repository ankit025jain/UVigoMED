{"id":78974,"title":"[Functional and aesthetic therapy concepts of keloids in the head- and neck area].","abstract":"Keloids are fibroproliferative extreme variants of an impaired wound healing, developing a tumour-like growth. In the ENT area keloids arise mainly at auricle. Often caused by piercings or trauma. They grow bulging excessively over the original scar edges and adopt sometimes bizarre morphologies. The patients complain often of dysesthesias such as burning pain, severe itching and are suffering often from stigmatization. The huge number of therapy methods, for the treatment of keloids described in the literature (silicon therapy, compression, intralesional corticoids, intra- or extralesional surgical excision, kryosurgery, radiatio, Interferon- or Bleomycin-therapy) emphasize the enormous challenge for the treating doctor, particularly in facial plastic surgery.
