{"id":87880,"title":"Timing of forearm arterial repair in the well-perfused limb.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference in the outcomes of patients with a well-perfused hand who were taken to the operating room (OR) within 6 hours of forearm arterial injury vs patients who were treated in a semiurgent fashion. A review of 201 consecutive patients who were taken to the OR with forearm-level radial or ulnar arterial injury identified 26 patients who had a well-perfused hand at presentation in whom hemostasis was achieved within 15 minutes with manual pressure and no signs of hemodynamic instability. Outcomes of interest included short-version Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (quickDASH) scores and patient-reported cold intolerance. Of the 26 patients, group 1 included 17 patients who were taken to the OR within 6 hours and group 2 included 9 patients who were taken to the OR in a delayed fashion. Minimum follow-up in both groups was 13 months. Average quickDASH score was 24.5 and 14.1 for groups 1 and 2, respectively. Average time spent in the OR was significantly less in group 2 compared with group 1 (1.7 vs 2.8 hours). In the setting of forearm arterial injury with a well-perfused distal limb, there was no difference in functional outcome in patients taken to the OR emergently compared with those who underwent surgery in a delayed manner. With careful evaluation and monitoring, semiurgent operative repair is feasible and may improve certain aspects of patient care and hospital resource use. Outcome measures in this study support semiurgent treatment of these injuries.
