{"id":20568,"title":"[IS CR1 associated with bla CTX-M-1 y bla CTX-M-2 genes in IncN and IncFIIA plasmids isolated from Klebsiella pneumoniae of nosocomial origin in MÃ©rida, Venezuela].","abstract":"Insertion sequences such as IS CR1 promote capture, transposition and expression of bla CTX-M genes. Thus, gene dissemination in bacterial populations occurs rapidly.To determine the presence of IS CR1 sequence genes and their association with bla CTX-M-1 and bla CTX-M-2 on plasmids IncN and IncFIIA from K. pneumoniae of nosocomial origin, was determined.Three strains of K. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to extendedspectrum cephalosporins were isolated from neonatal sepsis cases of nosocomial origin. Phenotypic tests showed the presence of ESBLs. Plasmids were isolated and classified according to incompatibility groups by PCR replicon typing. Detection and association of IS CR1 with bla CTX-M genes were determined by PCR and direct sequencing through the use of several sets of PCR primers.All strains showed phenotypic profile consistent with ESBL-producing transferred by conjugation. PCR amplification assay for CTX-M together with sequencing analysis revealed that strains carrying bla CTX-M-1 y bla CTX-M-2 genes were localized in plasmids of approximately 150 kb related to IncN and IncFIIA groups, respectively. IS CR1 was found upstream and associated with bla CTX-M-1 y bla CTX-M-2 genes. CONCLUSION Thus far, this is the first Venezuelan report, in which IS CR1 presence is closely related to bla CTX-M-1 y bla CTX-M-2 gene mobilization in IncN and IncFIIA conjugative plasmids located in K. pneumonaiae strains circulating at a neonatal high risk unit.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652137","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Transposon","weight":0.851187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposon"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Bacterial conjugation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_conjugation"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Replicon (genetics)","weight":0.794482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicon_(genetics)"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Insertion sequence","weight":0.754904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sequence"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.6805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.652547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Insertion (genetics)","weight":0.603266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.525366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.452868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.416483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Venezuela","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Vitamin K","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_K"}]}
