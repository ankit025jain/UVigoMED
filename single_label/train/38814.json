{"id":38814,"title":"Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry: rapid identification of bacteria isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis.","abstract":"Despite extensive research into the diagnosis and management of cystic fibrosis (CF) over the past decades, sufferers still have a median life expectancy of less than 37 years. Respiratory tract infections have a significant role in increasing the morbidity and mortality of patients with CF via a progressive decline in lung function. Rapid identification of organisms recovered from CF sputum is necessary for effective management of respiratory tract infections; however, standard techniques of identification are slow, technically demanding and expensive. The aim of this study is to asses the suitability of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in identifying bacteria isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with CF, and is assessed by testing the accuracy of MALDI-TOF MS in identifying samples from a reference collection of rare CF strains in conjunction with comparing MALDI-TOF MS and standard techniques in identifying clinical isolates from sputum samples of CF patients. MALDI-TOF MS accurately identified 100% of isolates from the reference collection of rare CF pathogens (EuroCare CF collection). The isolate identification given by MALDI-TOF MS agreed with that given by standard techniques for 479/481 (99.6%) clinical isolates obtained from respiratory samples provided by patients with CE In two (0.4%) of 481 samples there was a discrepancy in identification between MALDI-TOF MS and standard techniques. One organism was identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa by MALDI-TOF but could only be identified by the laboratory's standard methods as of the Pseudomonas genus. The second organism was identified as P. beteli by MALDI-TOF MS and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia by standard methods. This study shows that MALDI-TOF MS is superior to standard techniques in providing cheap, rapid and accurate identification of CF sputum isolates.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400425","annotations":[{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.923045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.771817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.721571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.642864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.615797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.602943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.569944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.535093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.444457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia","weight":0.272753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotrophomonas_maltophilia"},{"name":"Stenotrophomonas","weight":0.226923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotrophomonas"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.143036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Common Era","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Donkey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey"},{"name":"Flight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
