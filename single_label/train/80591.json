{"id":80591,"title":"Development of targeted 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine-coated gelatin nanoparticles loaded with amphotericin B for improved in vitro and in vivo effect in leishmaniasis.","abstract":"The principle objective of this study was to develop 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (PS)-coated gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs) bearing amphotericin B (AmB) for specific targeting to the macrophages involved in visceral leishmaniasis (VL).The two-step desolvation method has been used for the preparation of GNPs with AmB, which was further coated with PS (PS-AmB-GNPs). The targeting potential of it was compared with uncoated AmB-loaded GNPs (AmB-GNPs) for in vitro and in vivo macrophage uptake.The results of flow cytometric data revealed enhanced uptake of PS-AmB-GNPs in J774A.1 macrophage cell lines compared with AmB-GNPs. In vivo organ distribution studies in Wistar rats demonstrated a significantly higher extent of accumulation of PS-AmB-GNPs compared with AmB-GNPs in macrophage-rich organs, particularly in liver and spleen. The in vivo anti-leishmanial activity of plain AmB, AmB-GNPs and PS-AmB-GNPs was tested against VL in Leishmania donovani-infected hamsters. Highly significant anti-leishmanial activity (p < 0.05 compared with AmB-GNPs) was observed with PS-AmB-GNPs, causing 85.3 ± 7.89% inhibition of splenic parasitic burden. AmB-GNPs and plain AmB caused only 71.0 ± 3.87 and 50.5 ± 5.12% parasite inhibitions, respectively, in Leishmania-infected hamsters (p < 0.05 for PS-AmB-GNPs versus plain AmB and AmB-GNPs versus plain AmB).The objective of the preparation was achieved and high accumulation of AmB in liver and spleen has been found, which resulted in enhanced anti-leishmanial activity.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606222","annotations":[{"name":"Amphotericin B","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphotericin_B"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Leishmania","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania"},{"name":"Visceral leishmaniasis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visceral_leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.40129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gelatin","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.143501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Hamster","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamster"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Plain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain"},{"name":"774","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/774"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Social inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inhibition"},{"name":"Woodfree uncoated paper","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodfree_uncoated_paper"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Solvation","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation"}]}
