{"id":6514,"title":"The immunomodulator AS101 suppresses production of inflammatory cytokines and ameliorates the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.","abstract":"We reported that AS101 (organotellurium compound, trichloro(dioxoethylene-O,O') tellurate) inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells and reduced the production of IL-17 and GM-CSF. In addition, AS101 promoted the production of IL-2 in activated T cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that AS101 inhibited Th17 cell proliferation. AS101 blocked the activation of transcriptional factor NFAT, Stat3, and ROR?t, and increased activation of Erk1/2, suggesting a mechanism of action of AS101. We further demonstrated that AS101 was effective in amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Finally, by real-time PCR analysis we showed that AS101 reduces the IL-17, IFN-?, GM-CSF, and IL-6 mRNA expression in inflammatory cells of spinal cords. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis also indicated that the CD4+ T cells and IL-17 and GM-CSF-producing cells were reduced in the spinal cords of AS101 treated mice compared to those treated with PBS.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975323","annotations":[{"name":"Immunomodulation
