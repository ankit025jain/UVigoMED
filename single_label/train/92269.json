{"id":92269,"title":"The role of leptin in regulating bone metabolism.","abstract":"Leptin was initially best known for its role in energy homeostasis and regulation of energy expenditure. In the past few years we have realized that leptin also plays a major role in neuroendocrine regulation and bone metabolism. Here, we review the literature the indirect and direct pathways through which leptin acts to influence bone metabolism and discuss bone abnormalities related to leptin deficiency in both animal and human studies. The clinical utility of leptin in leptin deficient individuals and its potential to improve metabolic bone disease are also discussed. We are beginning to understand the critical role leptin plays in bone metabolism; future randomized studies are needed to fully assess the potential and risk-benefit of leptin's use in metabolic bone disease particularly in leptin deficient individuals.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25497343","annotations":[{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.93303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.574091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.297966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.115637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Cost","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost"},{"name":"Metabolic bone disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_bone_disease"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Basal metabolic rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate"},{"name":"Renal osteodystrophy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_osteodystrophy"},{"name":"Clinical utility of diagnostic tests","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_utility_of_diagnostic_tests"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Energy balance (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_balance_(biology)"}]}
