{"id":19318,"title":"Poor utility of serum interleukin-6 levels to predict indolent periprosthetic shoulder infections.","abstract":"Infection after shoulder arthroplasty can present a diagnostic challenge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in diagnosis of periprosthetic infection in patients undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty.We prospectively enrolled 69 patients who underwent revision shoulder arthroplasty at one institution. All patients underwent a standard preoperative and intraoperative workup for infection, which included shoulder aspirate culture, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, tissue culture, and frozen section analysis. In addition, serum levels of IL-6 were measured preoperatively in all patients. Infection classification was divided into 4 groups, (1) definite, (2) probable, (3) possible, and (4) no infection, on the basis of previously reported criteria using intraoperative cultures and preoperative and intraoperative findings of infections.Of the 69 patients, 24 were classified as having a definite or probable infection. Propionibacterium acnes was the offending organism for the majority of these cases (20 of 24, 83%). IL-6 was not a sensitive marker of infection for these patients (sensitivity: 3 of 24, 12%; specificity: 3 of 45, 93%). The sensitivity of serum IL-6 was lower compared with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sensitivity: 10 of 24, 42%; specificity: 37 of 45, 82%) and C-reactive protein level (sensitivity: 11 of 24, 46%; specificity: 42 of 45, 93%). For the non-P. acnes cases (1 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 2 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species), the sensitivity of IL-6 was 25% (1 of 4).Serum IL-6 is not an effective marker for diagnosis of infection in shoulder arthroplasty. On the basis of this large prospective study, we do not recommend its use as a preoperative diagnostic test in patients undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725902","annotations":[{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Enterobacter","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacter"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.66425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.642946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.608558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.363565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.255638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.114755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Propionibacterium acnes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propionibacterium_acnes"},{"name":"Sedimentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Frozen section procedure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_section_procedure"},{"name":"Tissue culture","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_culture"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Cloaca","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca"},{"name":"Propionibacterium","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propionibacterium"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
