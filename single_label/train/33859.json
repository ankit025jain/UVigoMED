{"id":33859,"title":"Four-dimensional echocardiography with spatiotemporal image correlation and inversion mode for detection of congenital heart disease.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of 4-D echocardiography with inversion mode and spatiotemporal image correlation (IM-STIC) in the detection of normal and abnormal fetal hearts. We retrospectively studied 112 normal fetuses and 16 fetuses with a confirmed diagnosis of congenital heart disease. Two volumes were acquired from each of the fetuses using transverse and sagittal sweeps. Volumes were reconstructed with IM-STIC. In normal fetuses, IM-STIC facilitated visualization of the interior structures of the fetal heart and great vessels. The visualization rates of intended planes obtained from IM-STIC 4D data ranged from 55% to 100%. In 16 fetuses with congenital heart disease, IM-STIC was able to display the cardiac malformations using digital casting. Some of the malformations were suspected during pre-natal 2-D echocardiography, and their pre-natal IM-STIC diagnoses were confirmed by post-natal echocardiography, surgery and/or autopsy. Hence, 4-D IM-STIC allows better visualization of complex congenital heart disease and should be considered a very useful addition to 2-D echocardiography.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785438","annotations":[{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.819203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.793981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.729272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.445403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.332466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.269337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.18417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Great vessels","weight":0.0539166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_vessels"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Spacetime","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Fixed-wing aircraft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Fetal circulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_circulation"},{"name":"Linguistic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Sweeps","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweeps"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mental image","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_image"}]}
