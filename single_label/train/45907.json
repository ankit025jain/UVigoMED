{"id":45907,"title":"Perforated jejunal diverticulum: a rare presentation of acute abdomen.","abstract":"Jejunal diverticulosis is a rare entity with a reported clinical incidence of 0.5%. However, symptoms relating to its presence are non-specific, which does not only delay diagnosis, but also increases the risk of serious complications approaching 15%. We report a case of perforated jejunal diverticulum presented with a 6-month history of significant weight loss and acute abdominal pain. We discuss clinical presentation in both simple and complex cases, diagnostic pitfalls and management strategies.
