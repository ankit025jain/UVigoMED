{"id":16746,"title":"Sepsis-induced myocardial depression and takotsubo syndrome.","abstract":"Abstract Background and objectives: Myocardial depression in the setting of sepsis and septic shock is common and has been recognized for a long time. The aim of this study is to find out an association and causal link between sepsis and takotsubo syndrome (TS).Fifteen cases of TS were studied. Critical review of the literature dealing with sepsis and myocardial depression was done Results: Fifteen cases of sepsis-induced TS are described. Fifty-three per cent of the patients were men. The ages ranged from 39 to 76 years (mean age 60 years). Two-thirds of the patients had ST-elevation myocardial infarction ECG changes. Complications occurred in 80% of the patients. No specific types of sepsis or micro-organisms were associated with the development of TS. Critical review of the sepsis-induced myocardial depression shows that the left ventricular dysfunction, which is reversible within one-to-two weeks, is characterized by segmental ventricular dysfunction, and involvement of the right ventricle in one fourth of cases. These features are also consistent with TS.Sepsis triggers TS, which may be the cause of the majority of cases of sepsis-induced myocardial depression. Acute cardiac sympathetic disruption with noradrenaline spill-over may be the cause of sepsis-induced TS.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24955937","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Norepinephrine","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.702796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.579775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.549112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Septic shock","weight":0.511486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.404036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.383887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.37361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.135743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Cent (currency)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(currency)"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Externality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"}]}
