{"id":52842,"title":"C-reactive protein levels in patients at cardiovascular risk: EURIKA study.","abstract":"Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are associated with high cardiovascular risk, and might identify patients who could benefit from more carefully adapted risk factor management. We have assessed the prevalence of elevated CRP levels in patients with one or more traditional cardiovascular risk factors.In the overall population, CRP levels were positively correlated with body mass index and glycated haemoglobin levels, and were negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. CRP levels were also higher in women, those at higher traditionally estimated cardiovascular risk and those with greater numbers of metabolic syndrome markers. Among patients without diabetes mellitus who were not receiving statin therapy, approximately 30% had CRP levels ?3 mg/L, and approximately 50% had CRP levels ?2 mg/L, including those at intermediate levels of traditionally estimated cardiovascular risk.CRP levels are elevated in a large proportion of patients with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, without diabetes mellitus who are not receiving statin therapy, suggesting a higher level of cardiovascular risk than predicted according to conventional risk estimation systems.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564178","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.798415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.774117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.472209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
