{"id":81723,"title":"Clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.","abstract":"Localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. Recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. The causative bacterial species in Israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of LAgP in this population. The objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an Israeli LAgP population who were also clinically assessed.Twenty-one LAgP patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. Bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups.Higher levels of Parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), Fusobacterium nucleatum/F. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and Tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the LAgP group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia were higher in the CP group.The characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of LAgP patients in Israel is mainly comprised of P. micra, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum/F. periodonticum and T. forsythia. Similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of LAgP when individual sampling is not possible.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861390","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.927012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Porphyromonas gingivalis","weight":0.912871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Prevotella intermedia","weight":0.858244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevotella_intermedia"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Fusobacterium","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusobacterium"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.81151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans","weight":0.786777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregatibacter_actinomycetemcomitans"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Chronic periodontitis","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Prevotella","weight":0.509643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevotella"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.340602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Gingival and periodontal pocket","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingival_and_periodontal_pocket"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.30465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.267177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.263246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.204374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Flora","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"}]}
