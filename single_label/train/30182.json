{"id":30182,"title":"Abuse liability of centrally acting non-opioid analgesics and muscle relaxants--a brief update based on a comparison of pharmacovigilance data and evidence from the literature.","abstract":"There is a lack of data regarding the abuse liability of centrally acting non-opioid analgesics (NOA) and muscle relaxants (MR). A comparison of data retrieved from a German pharmacovigilance database (BfArM; accessed May 2013) and data from the literature concerning the abuse liability of NOA and MR approved in Germany was performed. The BfArM-database demonstrated cases of abuse only for clonidine and paracetamol, whereas the literature suggests evidence for an abuse potential of baclofen, clonidine, ketamine, metamizole, methocarbamol, orphenadrine, paracetamol, propyphenazone, and tizanidine. The low number of detected cases in the BfArM-database could be a result of under-reporting.
