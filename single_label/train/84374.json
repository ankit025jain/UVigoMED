{"id":84374,"title":"Enhancing the interaction between annexin-1 and formyl peptide receptors regulates microglial activation to protect neurons from ischemia-like injury.","abstract":"As the immune cells of the brain, microglia are crucial for the maintenance of brain function. The aims of the present study were to determine whether and how annexin-1 is able to affect microglial phenotype and migration in the lesion microenvironment. In the current experiment, we enhanced the interaction between annexin-1 and formyl peptide receptors in microglia and analyzed the function. We found that annexin-1 could polarize microglia to a beneficial phenotype and promote microglial migration to protect neurons from ischemia-like injury, and the annexin-1-mediated neuroprotective effect was dependent on the release of glutamate and ATP from the injured neurons.
