{"id":17015,"title":"[Implanted medical device-related infections: pathophysiology and prevention].","abstract":"Medical progress led to an increase in the number of indications for indwelling devices. However, colonization of implanted devices by pathogenic microorganisms also increases risks of formation of microbial communities surrounded by an extracellular matrix called biofilms. Biofilms are able to survive in the presence of high concentrations of antimicrobials, therefore leading to treatment difficulties and exposing patients to the risk of infection recurrence. Because of these features, preventive measures reducing the risk of microbial contamination are cornerstone for the management of any patient carrying an indwelling device.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923044","annotations":[{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.791478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.701117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.583707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.304167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Immanence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanence"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Risk of infection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_of_infection"},{"name":"Cornerstone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone"},{"name":"Microbial population biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_population_biology"}]}
