{"id":19043,"title":"Electrically conductive catheter inhibits bacterial colonization.","abstract":"To design, prototype, and assess a custom vascular access catheter for its ability to inhibit bacterial colonization in vitro and to optimize electric parameters for efficacy and safe translation.A vascular access catheter with conductive elements was designed and custom fabricated with two electrodes at the tip, separated by a nonconductive segment. The catheter was colonized with Staphylococcus aureus and incubated at predetermined current levels (4-8 µA) and durations (4-24 h). Catheters were compared using bacterial counts and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).Bacteria colony-forming units were reduced significantly (P < .05) by > 90% (91.7%-100%) in all uninterrupted treatment arms that included electric current (4 µA or 8 µA) of at least 8 hours' duration. Qualitative analysis using SEM revealed that the treated catheter exposed to electric current had markedly less bacteria compared with the untreated catheter.This catheter with conductive elements inhibits bacterial colonization in vitro when very small electric current (4-8 µA) is applied across the tip for 8-24 hours. In vivo validation is requisite to future translation to the clinical setting.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745908","annotations":[{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.882502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.815861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Insulator (electrical)","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(electrical)"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.76378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.736347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.726259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.719463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.676274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Electrical resistivity and conductivity","weight":0.672491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.614608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.493174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.23813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.218004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Electrical conductor","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Semiconductor device fabrication","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication"},{"name":"Colony (biology)","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_(biology)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Prototype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Weapon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"}]}
