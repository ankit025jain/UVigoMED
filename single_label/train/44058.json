{"id":44058,"title":"Hypermutable DNA chronicles the evolution of human colon cancer.","abstract":"Intratumor genetic heterogeneity reflects the evolutionary history of a cancer and is thought to influence treatment outcomes. Here we report that a simple PCR-based assay interrogating somatic variation in hypermutable polyguanine (poly-G) repeats can provide a rapid and reliable assessment of mitotic history and clonal architecture in human cancer. We use poly-G repeat genotyping to study the evolution of colon carcinoma. In a cohort of 22 patients, we detect poly-G variants in 91% of tumors. Patient age is positively correlated with somatic mutation frequency, suggesting that some poly-G variants accumulate before the onset of carcinogenesis during normal division in colonic stem cells. Poorly differentiated tumors have fewer mutations than well-differentiated tumors, possibly indicating a shorter mitotic history of the founder cell in these cancers. We generate poly-G mutation profiles of spatially separated samples from primary carcinomas and matched metastases to build well-supported phylogenetic trees that illuminate individual patients' path of metastatic progression. Our results show varying degrees of intratumor heterogeneity among patients. Finally, we show that poly-G mutations can be found in other cancers than colon carcinoma. Our approach can generate reliable maps of intratumor heterogeneity in large numbers of patients with minimal time and cost expenditure.
