{"id":12030,"title":"The impact of temperature stress and pesticide exposure on mortality and disease susceptibility of endangered Pacific salmon.","abstract":"Anthropogenic stressors, including chemical contamination and temperature stress, may contribute to increased disease susceptibility in aquatic animals. Specifically, the organophosphate pesticide malathion has been detected in surface waters inhabited by threatened and endangered salmon. In the presence of increasing water temperatures, malathion may increase susceptibility to disease and ultimately threaten salmon survival. This work examines the effect of acute and sublethal exposures to malathion on ocean-type subyearling Chinook salmon held under two temperature regimes. Chinook salmon were exposed to malathion at optimal (11 째C) or elevated (19 and 20 째C) temperatures. The influence of temperature on the acute toxicity of malathion was determined by generating 96-h lethal concentration (LC) curves. A disease challenge assay was also used to assess the effects of sublethal malathion exposure. The malathion concentration that resulted in 50% mortality (LC50; 274.1 ?g L(-1)) of the Chinook salmon at 19 째C was significantly less than the LC50 at 11 째C (364.2 ?g L(-1)). Mortality increased 11.2% in Chinook salmon exposed to malathion at the elevated temperature and challenged with Aeromonas salmonicida compared to fish held at the optimal temperature and exposed to malathion or the carrier control. No difference in disease challenge mortality was observed among malathion-exposed and unexposed fish at the optimal temperature. The interaction of co-occurring stressors may have a greater impact on salmon than if they occur in isolation. Ecological risk assessments considering the effects of an individual stressor on threatened and endangered salmon may underestimate risk when additional stressors are present in the environment.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559935","annotations":[{"name":"Chinook salmon","weight":0.903216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_salmon"},{"name":"Pesticide","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Organophosphate","weight":0.801676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organophosphate"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Endangered species","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.710954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Salmon","weight":0.703503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon"},{"name":"Human impact on the environment","weight":0.642864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.627961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Pacific Ocean","weight":0.597539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.535711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.457112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.457054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.418291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Aquatic animal","weight":0.303234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_animal"},{"name":"Threatened species","weight":0.25402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_species"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Median lethal dose","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.170474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.154944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Photic zone","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_zone"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Malathion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malathion"},{"name":"Aeromonas salmonicida","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeromonas_salmonicida"},{"name":"Oncorhynchus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncorhynchus"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Acute toxicity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_toxicity"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Sea surface temperature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature"}]}
