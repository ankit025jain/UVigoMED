{"id":55212,"title":"Adjustable intraocular lens power technology.","abstract":"We present an overview of the adjustable intraocular lens (IOL) technologies that are available or under development. This includes IOL technologies that can be adjusted using secondary surgical procedures, such as the multicomponent IOL, the mechanically adjustable IOL, and the repeatedly adjustable IOL; IOLs that can be adjusted noninvasively in the postoperative setting, such as the magnetically adjustable IOL, the liquid crystal IOLs with wireless control; and IOLs that can be adjusted using the femtosecond laser or 2-photon chemistry. Finally, we discuss the preclinical and clinical studies of the light-adjustable intraocular lens (LAL) that is available commercially in Europe and Mexico and in the final stages of clinical evaluation in the United States. The general principles of each technology, as well as their research status, are described.No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24957439","annotations":[{"name":"Photon","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.654222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.520715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.369458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Crystal","weight":0.35878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.248197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.236089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.177041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Liquid crystal","weight":0.137394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.134085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.123079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Wireless","weight":0.114558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.0770068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Optical power","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_power"},{"name":"Property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property"},{"name":"Los Angeles Lakers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Ownership","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership"}]}
