{"id":69682,"title":"The next generation of antibody drug conjugates.","abstract":"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising therapeutic modality for the clinical management of cancer. The recent approvals of brentuximab vedotin and ado-trastuzumab emtansine plus emerging data for many molecules in clinical trials highlight the potential for ADCs to offer new therapeutic options for patients. Currently, more than 30 ADCs are being evaluated in early- or late-stage clinical trials. Accordingly, much has been done to refine and transform the early-generation ADCs to the highly effective products that we now have in clinical development. These changes include a better understanding of optimal target selection, advances in antibody engineering, improvements in linker/payload conjugation strategies, and the generation of highly potent ADC payloads. In this review, we detail the current status of ADCs in both preclinical and clinical development, highlight technological advancements in ADC development, and speculate towards the future of this targeted therapeutic platform.
