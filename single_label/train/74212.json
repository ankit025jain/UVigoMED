{"id":74212,"title":"Excellent local control with preoperative radiation therapy, surgical resection, and intra-operative electron radiation therapy for retroperitoneal sarcoma.","abstract":"To examine the value of surgical resection combined with preoperative external beam radiation therapy and intraoperative radiation therapy (Surg-RT) for retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS).Review of 63 consecutive patients with RPS from 1996 to 2011.Thirty-seven patients (59%) underwent Surg-RT and 26 (41%) had surgery alone. 51% of tumors were high grade and 36% of patients had locally recurrent disease. Final margin status was: R0 73%, R1 16%, R2 6%, and unknown 5%. Of those with R0 resections, 67% received Surg-RT. Median follow-up was 45 months. The 5-year local control rate was 89% for Surg-RT patients and 46% for surgery alone patients (P?=?0.03). On multivariate analysis, Surg-RT was the only variable associated with a lower risk of LR (HR 0.19; CI 0.05-0.69, P?=?0.003). The actuarial 5-year OS was 60% for patients receiving either Surg-RT or surgery alone.The combination of pre-operative radiation, surgical resection, and intraoperative radiation produces excellent local disease control for RPS. Combination therapy was associated with improved local control but not with overall survival.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24862926","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"External beam radiotherapy","weight":0.663334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.61033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Intraoperative radiation therapy","weight":0.529028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraoperative_radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.460235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.336682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.123776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.0479091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Actuarial science","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.0326281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Combination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Beam (nautical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"}]}
