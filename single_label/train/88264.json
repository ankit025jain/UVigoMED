{"id":88264,"title":"Wrist arthrodesis in children - a new technique: case presentation.","abstract":"Wrist arthrodesis is exceptionally performed in children. The main indication is severe wrist flexion contracture resulting from Volkmann's ischaemia or spasticity. In such cases, a proximal row carpectomy is usually necessary to allow the wrist to be positioned in neutral position. In young children, it is essential to preserve the distal radius growth plate, to prevent physeal closure. In these very particular indications, with high stresses along the stretched palmar soft-tissues, Kirschner wire fixation provides poor stability, and plate fixation is contra-indicated. Radio-metacarpal external fixation is an excellent alternative, preserving the distal radius growth plate and offering sufficient stability. This technique was used in a seven-year-old girl suffering from Volkmann's ischaemic contracture, treated by first carpal bone resection and subsequent arthrodesis with radio-metacarpal external fixation. Bone healing was achieved in three months, with a five years follow-up preservation of the distal radius growth plate.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875519","annotations":[{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.910325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.743467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.719274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Spasticity","weight":0.710405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasticity"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.676915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Epiphyseal plate","weight":0.619832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyseal_plate"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.581342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.417059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.397589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Kirschner wire","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirschner_wire"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Arthrodesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrodesis"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Marc Kirschner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Kirschner"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Grappling position","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling_position"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"}]}
