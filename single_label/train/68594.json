{"id":68594,"title":"Invasive management of proximal ureteral calculi during pregnancy.","abstract":"To review our experience with invasive management of proximal ureteral calculi during pregnancy when conservative treatment fails.From February 2006 to September 2012, a total of 87 pregnant women received invasive management for proximal ureteral calculi in our center. Invasive management included the following: double-J stent insertion, percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN), and ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URSL). The medical records of these patients were reviewed retrospectively.Of the 87 patients, 4 patients received PCN; 19 patients received cystoscopic double-J stent insertion, whereas 2 patients (10.5%) failed in guide wire inserting and switched to ureteroscopic aid; a total of 64 patients received URSL with holmium laser, in which 52 patients (81.2%) had complete fragmentation of calculi; in 9 patients (14.1%), stone fragments retrograde migrated to the renal pelvis; in 3 patients (4.7%), the stone could not be reached because of serious ureteral tortuosity. One patient (1.6%) patient had a threatened abortion, but this problem was resolved immediately using conservative treatment. All patients completed the full term of pregnancy, and no serious obstetric or urologic complications were observed.For pregnant patients with proximal ureteral calculi, double-J stent insertion, PCN, and URSL all are effective and safe options when conservative treatment fails. They should be chosen on the basis of different patient's condition. However, patient's postoperative tolerance was poor for double-J stent insertion and PCN; URSL (especially with holmium laser lithotripsy) is more effective and should be considered as the preferred choice.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508478","annotations":[{"name":"Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy","weight":0.841488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_shock_wave_lithotripsy"},{"name":"Nephrostomy","weight":0.828744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrostomy"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.801283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.769936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Renal pelvis","weight":0.761238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_pelvis"},{"name":"Cystoscopy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystoscopy"},{"name":"Holmium","weight":0.72991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmium"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.712724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.691273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.616493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.516632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Laser lithotripsy","weight":0.449902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_lithotripsy"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Ureteroscopy","weight":0.401232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureteroscopy"},{"name":"Calculus (medicine)","weight":0.243325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Tortuosity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortuosity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Threatened species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_species"},{"name":"10.5 (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
