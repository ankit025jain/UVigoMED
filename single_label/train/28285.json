{"id":28285,"title":"[Prevention of binge drinking in adolescents: do family doctors have a role to play?].","abstract":"Binge drinking has nearly become the norm for young people and is thus worrying. Although alcohol use in males attracts more media attention, females are also frequently affected. A variety of preventive measures can be proposed: at the individual level by parents, peers and family doctors; at the school and community level, particularly to postpone age of first use and first episode of drunkenness; at the structural level through a policy restricting access to alcohol for young people and increasing its price. Family doctors can play an important role in identifying at risk users and individualising preventive messages to which these young people are exposed in other contexts.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930152","annotations":[{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.676438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.59757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.550471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.515743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.422818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.418315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.312183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"School","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Binge drinking","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_drinking"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Access control","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control"},{"name":"Ronald Binge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Binge"},{"name":"Binge eating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_eating"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"Television pilot","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Price","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"}]}
