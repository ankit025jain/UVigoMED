{"id":49033,"title":"Elevated plantar pressure in diabetic patients and its relationship with their gait features.","abstract":"High plantar pressure is a major risk factor for diabetic foot ulcers. The relationship between plantar pressure and foot mobility has been investigated in some studies. However, when the foot is in motion, foot mobility is only a small feature of the gait. Therefore, we investigated relationship between high plantar pressure and gait and also studied the motion of the trunk. In addition, we investigated the relationship between gait and patient characteristics to identify patients at high-risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers.The relationships between elevated plantar pressure, gait features, and patient characteristics were analyzed. Plantar pressure distribution in the stance phase was divided on the four plantar segments. Elevated plantar pressure was defined as being more than the mean plus one standard deviation of the corresponding segment in non-diabetic subjects. Plantar pressure distribution was measured by an F-scan system, and gait features were measured using wireless motion sensors attached to the sacrum and feet. Patient characteristics were obtained from medical records or by interview.Small roll and yaw motions of the body and yaw motion of the foot during the mid-stance phase were related to the elevated plantar pressure in 57 diabetic patients. Furthermore, these gait features were related to sensory neuropathy, diabetes duration, patient weight, toe-gap force, and ankle range of motion.Given our findings, it may be possible to prevent diabetic foot ulcers by increasing foot motion during the mid-stance phase. Passive exercise aimed at expanding ankle range of motion in patients with sensory neuropathy or long-standing diabetes may assist in achieving this.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974127","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.648748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.521924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.520699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.514275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.329879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.326731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.187873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.111149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.10542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Foot (unit)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)"},{"name":"Pedobarography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedobarography"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Wireless","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pressure coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_coefficient"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Plantar","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Motion detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_detection"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
