{"id":88361,"title":"Brachial artery pseudoaneurysm.","abstract":"We describe a case of an elderly man who presented with an upper arm swelling that had developed following a humeral fracture 8?months previously. The swelling was painless but associated with significantly diminished motor function of his right hand and concurrent paraesthaesia. On examination, a large pulsatile mass was identified and CT angiography confirmed the presence of an 11Ã—7?cm brachial artery pseudoaneurysm. The patient underwent surgical repair in which a fragment of the humerus was found to have punctured the brachial artery resulting in a pseudoaneurysm. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative period and was discharged 2?days later having regained some motor function in his right hand.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859555","annotations":[{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.810802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.688541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.671522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.595028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.437717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Brachial artery","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_artery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Electric motor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Pulsatile insulin","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsatile_insulin"},{"name":"Computed tomography angiography","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography_angiography"}]}
