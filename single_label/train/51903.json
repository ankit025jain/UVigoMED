{"id":51903,"title":"Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis associated with transient cerebral dyschromatopsia, prosopagnosia, and lack of stereopsis.","abstract":"A 20-year-old woman suffered from anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis and was treated with removal of an ovarian teratoma and retroperitoneal ganglioneuroma in addition to immunotherapy. She was incapable of face recognition, had difficulty with object recognition, and lacked color sensation and stereo perception during recovery. These symptoms were transient and completely resolved over 4 months. Our report documents additional aspects of visual impairment associated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and suggests that the disease can lead to diffuse cerebral dysfunction including the cortical visual system.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647141","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Encephalitis","weight":0.703062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Prosopagnosia","weight":0.539495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia"},{"name":"NMDA receptor","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor"},{"name":"Object recognition (computer vision)","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_recognition_(computer_vision)"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Stereopsis","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereopsis"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.190214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.124458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.115637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Teratoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratoma"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Ganglioneuroma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglioneuroma"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Stereophonic sound","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound"},{"name":"Facial recognition system","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 20","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_20"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
