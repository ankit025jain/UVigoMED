{"id":8320,"title":"Therapeutic efficacy of combining pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and radiofrequency (RF) ablation: comparison between slow-drug-releasing, non-thermosensitive and fast-drug-releasing, thermosensitive nano-liposomes.","abstract":"To determine how the accumulation of drug in mice bearing an extra-hepatic tumor and its therapeutic efficacy are affected by the type of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin used, treatment modality, and rate of drug release from the liposomes, when combined with radiofrequency (RF) ablation.Two nano-drugs, both long-circulating PEGylated doxorubicin liposomes, were formulated: (1) PEGylated doxorubicin in thermosensitive liposomes (PLDTS), having a burst-type fast drug release above the liposomes' solid ordered to liquid disordered phase transition (at 42Â°C), and (2) non-thermosensitive PEGylated doxorubicin liposomes (PLDs), having a slow and continuous drug release. Both were administered intravenously at 8 mg/kg doxorubicin dose to tumor-bearing mice. Animals were divided into 6 groups: no treatment, PLD, RF, RF+PLD, PLDTS, and PLDTS+RF, for intra-tumor doxorubicin deposition at 1, 24, and 72 h post-injection (in total 41, mice), and 31 mice were used for randomized survival studies.Non-thermosensitive PLD combined with RF had the least tumor growth and the best end-point survival, better than PLDTS+RF (p<0.005) or all individual therapies (p<0.001). Although at 1 h post-treatment the greatest amount of intra-tumoral doxorubicin was seen following PLDTS+RF (p<0.05), by 24 and 72 h the greatest doxorubicin amount was seen for PLD+RF (p<0.05); in this group the tumor also has the longest exposure to doxorubicin.Optimizing therapeutic efficacy of PLD requires a better understanding of the relationship between the effect of RF on tumor microenvironment and liposome drug release profile. If drug release is too fast, the benefit of changing the microenvironment by RF on tumor drug localization and therapeutic efficacy may be much smaller than for PLDs having slow and temperature-independent drug release. Thus the much longer circulation time of doxorubicin from PLD than from PLDTS may be beneficial in many therapeutic instances, especially in extra-hepatic tumors.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24786533","annotations":[{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.83303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.634911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.564519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.447586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.331296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.269459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.177041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.163124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.149145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Phase transition","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Programmable logic device","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_device"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Compiler optimization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler_optimization"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Transition metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"},{"name":"Order and disorder (physics)","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_and_disorder_(physics)"}]}
