{"id":69515,"title":"Vitamin D receptor and its protective role in diabetic nephropathy.","abstract":"To review the advances of studies on vitamin D receptor and its role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.A comprehensive search of the PubMed literatures without restriction on the publication date was carried out using keywords such as vitamin D receptor and diabetic nephropathy.Articles related to vitamin D receptor and diabetic nephropathy were selected and carefully analyzed.The ligands as well as construction and tissue distribution of vitamin D receptor were summarized. Pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy was analyzed. The mechanisms underlying the renoprotective role of vitamin D receptor including inhibition of renin-angiotensin system, anti-inflammation, anti-fibrosis and the reduction of proteinuria were reviewed. Mounting evidences from animal and clinical studies have suggested that vitamin D therapy has beneficial effects on the renal systems and the underlying renoprotective mechanisms of the vitamin D receptor-mediated signaling pathways is a hot research topic.Our study suggests that vitamin D receptor has a great potential for preventing the progression of diabetic nephropathy via multiple mechanisms.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438630","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetic nephropathy","weight":0.885117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_nephropathy"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.829794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Calcitriol receptor","weight":0.538707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol_receptor"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.49331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.482208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.341689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.314732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.300978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.268576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.225021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
