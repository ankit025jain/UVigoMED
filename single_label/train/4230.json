{"id":4230,"title":"Consumption of non-cow's milk beverages and serum vitamin D levels in early childhood.","abstract":"Vitamin D fortification of non-cow's milk beverages is voluntary in North America. The effect of consuming non-cow's milk beverages on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in children is unclear. We studied the association between non-cow's milk consumption and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in healthy preschool-aged children. We also explored whether cow's milk consumption modified this association and analyzed the association between daily non-cow's milk and cow's milk consumption.In this cross-sectional study, we recruited children 1-6 years of age attending routinely scheduled well-child visits. Survey responses, and anthropometric and laboratory measurements were collected. The association between non-cow's milk consumption and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels was tested using multiple linear regression and logistic regression. Cow's milk consumption was explored as an effect modifier using an interaction term. The association between daily intake of non-cow's milk and cow's milk was explored using multiple linear regression.A total of 2831 children were included. The interaction between non-cow's milk and cow's milk consumption was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Drinking non-cow's milk beverages was associated with a 4.2-nmol/L decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level per 250-mL cup consumed among children who also drank cow's milk (p = 0.008). Children who drank only non-cow's milk were at higher risk of having a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level below 50 nmol/L than children who drank only cow's milk (odds ratio 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 4.7).Consumption of non-cow's milk beverages was associated with decreased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in early childhood. This association was modified by cow's milk consumption, which suggests a trade-off between consumption of cow's milk fortified with higher levels of vitamin D and non-cow's milk with lower vitamin D content.","date":"2014-11-18","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25332367","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.842185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.625535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.578346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.562585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.332283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.212223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.140104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.130071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.127493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Fortification","weight":0.115174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0932836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0499462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0401361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Free will","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Trade-off","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade-off"}]}
