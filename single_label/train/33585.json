{"id":33585,"title":"In vitro xanthine oxidase inhibitory and in vivo hypouricemic activity of herbal coded formulation (Gouticin).","abstract":"Currently, natural products have been used in treating gouty arthritis and are recognized as xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Current study was designed to evaluate in vitro xanthine oxidase inhibitory potential of Gouticin and its ingredients extracts and in vivo hypouricemic activity of gouticin tablet 500 mg twice daily. Ethanol extracts of Gouticin and its ingredients were evaluated in vitro, at 200, 100, 50, 25 ? g/ml concentrations for xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity. IC(50) values of Gouticin and its ingredients were estimated. Further, in vivo therapeutic effect of Gouticin was investigated in comparison with allopathic medicine (Allopurinol) to treat gout. Total patients were 200 that were divided into test and control group. Herbal coded medicine (Gouticin) was given to test group and allopathic medicine allopurinol was administered to control group. In vitro, Gouticin has the highest percent inhibition at 96% followed by Allopurinol with 93% inhibition. In vivo study, mean serum uric acid level of patients was 4.62 mg/dl and 5.21mg/dl by use of Gouticin and Allopurinol at end of therapy. The study showed that herbal coded formulation gouticin and its ingredients are potential sources of natural xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Gouticin 500 mg twice daily is more effective than the allopurinol 300mg once daily in the management of gout.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24811815","annotations":[{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"Allopurinol","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopurinol"},{"name":"Gout","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout"},{"name":"Xanthine","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthine"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.750305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.668921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.629021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Xanthine oxidase","weight":0.49665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthine_oxidase"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.256982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.244741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Ingredient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingredient"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Oxidase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidase"}]}
