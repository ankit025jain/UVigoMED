{"id":14838,"title":"Outbreak of pathogenic Escherichia coli in an outdoor-housed non-human primate colony.","abstract":"Pathogenic Escherichia coli has been identified as an etiologic agent in humans causing acute diarrhea or even death but has been rarely reported in non-human primates (NHP). An outbreak of diarrhea occurred in an outdoor-housed NHP colony over a period of 2 months with an attack rate of 29%.Bacterial culture and PCR were performed on the fecal specimens to identify enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) in the NHPs.By random sampling of 10% of fecal samples of diarrheal cases, four cases of EIEC in rhesus macaques and two cases of EHEC in cynomolgus macaques were confirmed.This is the first time EIEC and EHEC have been reported in NHPs associated with diarrhea. The primary source of infection could not be determined.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400996","annotations":[{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.873494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Rhesus macaque","weight":0.793451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.5941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.582972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.521852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Macaque","weight":0.512701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.451911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Crab-eating macaque","weight":0.314973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab-eating_macaque"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.230777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.112558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Attack rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_rate"}]}
