{"id":28780,"title":"The role of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in alcohol craving experience.","abstract":"The way in which genetic risk mediates the development of craving in alcohol dependence is still relatively unknown. The authors sought to clarify the extent to which alcohol craving could be predicted by a relevant polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene encoding the 5-HT transporter (5-HTTLPR). A sample of 101 alcohol-dependent patients admitted for alcohol treatment was recruited for the study. At admission, blood samples were taken for DNA extraction and alcohol craving information was collected with a composite measure. The 5-HTT polymorphism was genotyped. Alcohol dependent patients who were homozygous for the long allele (LL) self-reported higher scores of craving when compared to patients that were homozygous for the short allele (SS). However, the results were not statistically significant. Also, no significant associations were observed between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and other drinking variables. No 5-HTTLPR genotype effects were observed on alcohol craving experience in a sample of alcohol-dependent outpatients.
