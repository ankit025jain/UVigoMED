{"id":60966,"title":"Long term follow-up of BEAM-autologous and BEAM-alemtuzumab allogeneic stem cell transplantation in relapsed advanced stage follicular lymphoma.","abstract":"This is an analysis in 171 patients comparing BEAM-Auto and BEAM-Allo (alemtuzumab)-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in relapsed follicular lymphoma. BEAM-Allo group had a lower 10 years cumulative incidence of relapse(31.4% vs 55.1%, p=0.042), a trend to a plateau in survival but no statistical differences in OS or DFS, and a TRM of 24%. When transplanted in CR BEAM-Allo patients had better OS and DFS. Incidence of acute and chronic GVHD was 16.6% and 22%. 29% of BEAM-Allo patients received DLI (all but two remain in CR and alive). Our data supports Allo-HSCT as a potential curative treatment for selected patients with FL.
