{"id":21958,"title":"Successful non-surgical treatment of endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus haemolyticus following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).","abstract":"We describe a case of a 79-year-old male patient with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) at our institution. He presented at the emergency department with dyspnea and fatigue 7 months after implantation. The diagnosis of early prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) caused by Staphylococcus haemolyticus was made by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and multiple positive blood cultures. Since our patient was considered inoperable due to a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with patent bypasses, high peri-operative mortality including renal failure and a poor general prognosis, surgical removal of the valve was not an option. The patient was successfully treated with antibiotic therapy.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579245","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.892916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Aortic valve stenosis","weight":0.860214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_stenosis"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Artificial heart valve","weight":0.649582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_heart_valve"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.542521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.527859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.33773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.316482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.309215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Perioperative mortality","weight":0.26116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative_mortality"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0597639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}]}
