{"id":30704,"title":"[Osteopontin level in the serum of patients with alcoholic liver disease, treated for alcohol withdrawal syndrome--a preliminary report].","abstract":"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is consequence of alcohol addiction, that increase morbidity and mortality of those group of patients. Induction of the inflammatory process in alcohol injured liver is a turning point in ALD, can cause acute liver damage symptoms or cirrhosis with increase of hepatic fibrosis intensity and portal hypertension. Osteopontin (OPN)--a protein associated with early inflammatory process and remodeling of damaged tissues with intensification of hepatic fibrogenesis process, is considered to be a biomarker of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. A group of 12 patients with mean age--44 years, mean alcohol addiction time--16 years, hospitalized because of alcohol withdrawal symptoms were examined in the preliminary report. ALD was diagnosed in all patients, steatosis--in 4, inflammatory--in 3, cirrhosis--in 5. Control group were 19 healthy patients with no alcohol addiction and liver disease in medical history. Serum OPN level was measured by ELISA method using reagents from Raybiotech. Serum OPN level in control group ranged 0-35,955 pg/ml, in examined group ranged 0-338,280 pg/ml. OPN levels in serum of patients with hepatic steatosis were under limit of detection (< 50 pg/ml). OPN serum level increase was correlated to ALD progression. The highest OPN levels (> 100,000 pg/ml) were observed in patients with symptoms of the liver decompensation due to severe hepatitis and advanced cirrhosis.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466690","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.920564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Portal hypertension","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_hypertension"},{"name":"Alcoholic liver disease","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_liver_disease"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Osteopontin","weight":0.77421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopontin"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.510971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.479277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.459499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.378707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Alcohol withdrawal syndrome","weight":0.331689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal_syndrome"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.223263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.193635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Adrenoleukodystrophy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenoleukodystrophy"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"}]}
