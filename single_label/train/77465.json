The modality is useful in the organization of medical aid to cancer patients, in developing management decisions for the reduction the occupational load on the population, as well as in solutions problems in compensation to the population economic and social loss from industrial plants.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749287","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.679314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.506033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.400359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.356854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.17571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Forecasting","weight":0.14971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.115375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Probabilistic forecasting","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_forecasting"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Payment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment"}]}
