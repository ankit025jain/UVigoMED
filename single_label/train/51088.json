{"id":51088,"title":"[Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)].","abstract":"Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is now commonly used as a tool to measure blood glucose levels of diabetic patients, as health insurance started to cover its cost for patients receiving insulin. However, SMBG is used to evaluate blood glucose levels at different time points, making it impossible to speculate on changes in blood glucose levels occurring before and after measurement. Currently, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), which determines diurnal blood glucose patterns on a continuous basis, is being introduced into routine clinical diabetic care. CGM results sometimes show abnormal blood glucose variations or hypoglycemia after meals or during sleep, even if SMBG results show normal levels in the same patient. The identification of blood glucose variations is the main advantage of CGM. This study reviewed the characteristic of and methods for preventing hypo and hyperglycemia based on the pattern of blood glucose variations in type 1 and type 2 diabetes that was identified by the introduction of CGM.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724427","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Blood glucose monitoring","weight":0.632378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_glucose_monitoring"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.583977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Diurnality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnality"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Speculation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
