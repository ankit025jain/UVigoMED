{"id":44720,"title":"Modified gastroduodenostomy in laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy: a 'tornado' anastomosis.","abstract":"This study was to examine the utility of a modified double-stapling end-to-end gastroduodenostomy method ('Tornado' anastomosis) compared to a method with an additional gastrotomy ('Anterior Incision' method) in laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy.Forty-two patients with gastric cancer who underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy were analyzed retrospectively. Billroth-I using an additional gastrotomy was performed in 24 patients (AI group) and Billroth-I without an additional gastrotomy was performed in 18 (TOR group). Clinicopathological features, operative outcomes (lymph node dissection, operative time, operative blood loss) and postoperative outcomes (complications, postoperative hospital stay, and body weight loss at one year after surgery) were evaluated and compared between groups.Operative time was significantly shorter in the TOR group (251 min) than in the AI group (282 min) (p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences in operative blood loss, postoperative complications, and hospital stay between the 2 study groups. Body weight loss at one year after surgery was -5.8 kg in the TOR group and -6.5 kg in the AI group, without a statistically significant difference.Completion time for Billroth-I anastomosis was significantly shorter with Tornado anastomosis than with the Anterior Incision method, with safety equal between the two methods.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719958","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.682505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.498516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.452197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.423352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.382184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.359971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.236089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Tornado","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Toronto Blue Jays","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"}]}
