{"id":84979,"title":"Safety and efficacy of ceftriaxone for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a multi-stage, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","abstract":"Glutamate excitotoxicity might contribute to the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In animal models, decreased excitatory aminoacid transporter 2 (EAAT2) overexpression delays disease onset and prolongs survival, and ceftriaxone increases EAAT2 activity. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ceftriaxone for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in a combined phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trial.Stage 3 included 66 participants from stages 1 and 2 and 448 new participants. In total, 340 participants were randomly allocated to ceftriaxone and 173 to placebo. During stages 1 and 2, mean ALSFRS-R declined more slowly in participants who received 4 g ceftriaxone than in those on placebo (difference 0·51 units per month, 95% CI 0·02 to 1·00; p=0·0416), but in stage 3 functional decline between the treatment groups did not differ (0·09, -0·06 to 0·24; p=0·2370). No significant differences in survival between the groups were recorded in stage 3 (HR 0·90, 95% CI 0·71 to 1·15; p=0·4146). Gastrointestinal adverse events and hepatobiliary adverse events were more common in the ceftriaxone group than in the placebo group (gastrointestinal, 245 of 340 [72%] ceftriaxone vs 97 of 173 [56%] placebo, p=0·0004; hepatobiliary, 211 [62%] vs 19 [11%], p<0·0001). Significantly more participants who received ceftriaxone had serious hepatobiliary serious adverse events (41 participants [12%]) than did those who received placebo (0 participants).Despite promising stage 2 data, stage 3 of this trial of ceftriaxone in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis did not show clinical efficacy. The adaptive design allowed for seamless transition from one phase to another, and central venous catheter use in the home setting was shown to be feasible.National Institute of Neurological Disorders
