{"id":36619,"title":"Anomalous origin of left coronary artery with left anterior descending artery connected to left pulmonary artery from single right coronary artery.","abstract":"Single right coronary artery, so defined because all three coronary arteries arise from the single right aortic sinus of Valsalva, is an extremely rare entity occurring in less than 0.03% of the population. This case identifies a single coronary artery with the left anterior descending coronary artery distally connected to the left pulmonary artery with development of pulmonary hypertension. To the author's knowledge, this has never been documented in the English literature.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564056","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.933358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.856973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Right coronary artery","weight":0.827062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Aortic sinus","weight":0.824228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_sinus"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.43922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.33838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Left pulmonary artery","weight":0.279732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Anterior interventricular branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.257912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_interventricular_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Left coronary artery","weight":0.212004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.102441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Valsalva maneuver","weight":0.0418302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"England","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"}]}
