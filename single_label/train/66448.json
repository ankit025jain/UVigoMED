{"id":66448,"title":"Recurrent calcium phosphate urolithiasis in a black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata).","abstract":"An adult intact male black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) suffered recurrent bouts of urethral blockage over a 3-yr period caused by calcium phosphate (apatite form) uroliths. Surgical intervention was required in two of the three instances. Various attempts at medical management failed to control formation of the stones, and the underlying etiology remains unclear. In addition, there have been consistent, multiple, unchanging renal mineralizations over the course of the case. Medical management failed to significantly alter the urinary pH; although, to date, no further problems have been noted. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first known report of calcium phosphate stones in a prosimian species.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712174","annotations":[{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.729617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.699947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Calcium phosphate","weight":0.579085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.573771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.525419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.487637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Apatite","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatite"},{"name":"Bladder stone (animal)","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_stone_(animal)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.282358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Urolithiasis","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urolithiasis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Prosimian","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosimian"},{"name":"Lemur","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemur"},{"name":"Ruffed lemur","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruffed_lemur"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Ruffed Grouse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruffed_Grouse"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Black-and-white ruffed lemur","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-and-white_ruffed_lemur"}]}
