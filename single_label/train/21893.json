{"id":21893,"title":"Transfer of patient care during two-stage exchange for periprosthetic joint infection leads to inferior outcomes.","abstract":"The two-stage exchange algorithm is the gold standard for managing chronic periprosthetic joint infection (PJI); this study evaluated the impact of having the stages performed at different institutions. Patients with a chronically infected total joint arthroplasty (hip or knee) with initial resection at an outside hospital and subsequent care at our institution (transferred group) were identified then matched with a similar cohort that received both stages at our institution (continuous group). Eighteen patients (transferred group) were compared to 36 matched controls. There were significantly lower rates of successful reimplantation and retention, longer duration of treatment and more procedures in the transferred group compared to the continuous group. Patients transferred during their care for chronic PJI underwent more surgeries, longer treatment times, and less favorable outcomes.
