{"id":86054,"title":"Predictors for postoperative complications after tracheal resection.","abstract":"Tracheal resection and anastomosis is the gold standard for the treatment of tracheal stenosis. The objective of this study is to evaluate the complications after tracheal resection for benign stenosis and the predicting factors for such complications.A retrospective study was made involving patients with benign tracheal or laryngotracheal stenosis who underwent surgical resection and reconstruction between February 2002 and January 2009. Complications related and unrelated to the anastomosis were studied. Categorical variables were presented as percentage and continuous variables as mean and standard deviation. Predicting factors were determined by univariate analysis. Factors with p less than 0.05 were used for multivariate regression. Logistic regression models were also employed for dependent variables. Statistical significance was set for p less than 0.05.Ninety-four patients (18 female, 76 male) were included. Complications occurred in 42 (44.6%). Twenty-one percent had anastomotic complications. The most common complication was restenosis (16%). Nonanastomotic complications occurred in 23.2%. Wound infection occurred in 10.6%. Clinical comorbidities, previous tracheal resection, and the length of tracheal resection were statistically significant factors for complications. Previous tracheal resection was the most significant factor and was highly associated with anastomotic complications (odds ratio 49.965, p=0.012). The greatest number of complications was found in the laryngotracheal reconstruction group, and in resections more than 4 cm. Mean follow-up was 19Â±14 months. At the end of the study, 86 patients (91.4%) were breathing normally. There was no mortality in this series.Comorbidities, previous tracheal resection, and the length of tracheal resection more than 4 cm were statistically significant factors for the onset of complications.","date":"2014-07-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24820396","annotations":[{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.866004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.804186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.731492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.695321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.545849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.352562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.324648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.229061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.142846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.136941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.128571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.125893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.0496211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Continuous probability distribution","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_probability_distribution"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
