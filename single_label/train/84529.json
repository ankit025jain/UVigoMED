{"id":84529,"title":"Pediatric hospital care for children with life-threatening illness and the role of palliative care.","abstract":"Under increasing pressure to contain costs, hospitals are challenged to provide high-quality care to an increasingly complex group of children with life-threatening illness (LTI) that often worsen over time. Pediatric palliative care is an essential component of optimal hospital care delivery for these children and their families. This article describes (1) the current landscape of pediatric hospital care for children with LTI, (2) the connection between palliative care and hospital care for such children, and (3) the relationship between health care reform and palliative care for children with LTI.
