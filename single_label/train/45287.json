{"id":45287,"title":"A case of jaundice of obscure origin.","abstract":"Idiopathic painless jaundice with significant elevations in serum transaminases, occurring in a previously healthy patient, invokes a circumscribed set of possibilities including viral hepatitis, auto-immune hepatitis (AIH) and drug-induced liver injury (DILI).In this described case, common causes of cholestatic jaundice were considered including drug-induced liver injury, viral causes of hepatitis, and auto-immune antibodies. Biliary obstruction was excluded by appropriate imaging studies. Liver biopsy was obtained, though not definitive.After detailed investigation failed to reveal a cause of the jaundice, an empiric trial of steroids was initiated on the possibility that our patient had antibody-negative AIH and not DILI, with an associated grave prognosis.Empiric treatment with prednisone led to rapid resolution of jaundice and to the conclusion that the correct diagnosis was antibody-negative AIH.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24691629","annotations":[{"name":"Autoimmune hepatitis","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_hepatitis"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Cholestasis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholestasis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0583839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"}]}
