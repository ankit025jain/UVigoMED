{"id":55515,"title":"[Corneal protection in contact lens users].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy of corneoprotective agents (Corneregel and Solcoseryl) in contact lens users.A total of 66 long-term contact lens wearers with dry eye symptoms and varying degrees of corneal epitheliopathy were monitored. All patients used artificial tears, which, however, were not effective enough to suppress manifestations of corneal epitheliopathy and to release the associated discomfort. The therapy was supplemented with Corneregel. The following examination methods were applied: biomicroscopy with fluorescent staining, Norn test, Schirmer's test, advanced tearscopy with digital image analysis of the precorneal tear film lipid layer, corneal confocal microscopy. In all cases the assessment was performed prior to starting Corneregel and repeated in 7 days, 14 days and 1 month.Complete corneal re-epithelization and restoration of the most superficial layer of the epithelium were achieved within 7-14 days. In case of severe initial epitheliopathy the effect of Corneregel was not sufficient and epithelium defects remained. These patients additionally received Solcoseryl Eye Gel. After the treatment course the condition of corneal epithelium ameliorated and contact lens wearing comfort increased. A longer precorneal tear film break-up time indicated an increase of tear film stability. The total tear production did not change significantly. The moistening effect of Corneregel and low-viscosity artificial tears together with intensive regeneration of corneal epithelium enables structural recovery of the epithelial membrane and considerable improvement of the anterior corneal stroma.At the first stage of corneoprotective treatment it is appropriate to use preservative-free artificial tears of low and high viscosity. If the effect of tear substitutive therapy is unsatisfactory it is recommended to prescribe Corneregel and Solcoseryl. The regimen is to be adjusted individually.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864502","annotations":[{"name":"Contact lens","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.815043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.755917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Viscosity","weight":0.729788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.682628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.674188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.578527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Stroma of cornea","weight":0.386251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_of_cornea"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.370077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.349719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.244383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Corneal epithelium","weight":0.225705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_epithelium"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.161443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Image analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_analysis"},{"name":"Stroma (animal tissue)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_(animal_tissue)"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Artificial tears","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_tears"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Digital image","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image"}]}
