{"id":82251,"title":"Mumps-associated meningitis and encephalitis in patients with no suspected mumps infection.","abstract":"Mumps virus (MuV) was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 6 of 158 patients with meningitis or encephalitis in absence of clinical mumps in the context of mumps epidemics. Our results suggest the need for the study of MuV RNA in the CSF of neurological patients in this context.
