{"id":36101,"title":"Retroperitoneal bronchogenic cyst: prenatal diagnosis of cystoid formation, its progression and surgery.","abstract":"Presentation of a rare localization of bronchogenic cyst in retroperitoneum.A case of a patient with retroperitoneal localization of a bronchogenic cyst with a prenatally diagnosed cystic formation. The surgery was indicated at the age of 6 owing to the progression of lesion. The histopathological examination of removed cyst revealed the diagnosis of bronchogenic cyst. For four years following the surgery, the patient was clinically free of complications. The regularly performed ultrasound examinations of the abdomen have been showing normal findings.Despite the fact that retroperitoneal localization of bronchial cyst is very rare it should be considered in differential diagnosis (Fig. 3, Ref. 16).","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601704","annotations":[{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.626425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.607161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.598919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.592681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Cystoids","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystoids"},{"name":"Bronchogenic cyst","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchogenic_cyst"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Ficus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
