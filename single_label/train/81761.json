{"id":81761,"title":"Influence of xerostomia on oral health-related quality of life in the elderly: a 5-year longitudinal study.","abstract":"Xerostomia and tooth loss are major oral health problems in the elderly. The aim of this longitudinal study was to characterize the influence of xerostomia on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among elderly Japanese people.A total of 99 community-dwelling, independently living individuals aged 60 years and older were interviewed and underwent dental examination at baseline and at a 5-year follow-up. The Oral Health Impact Profile-14 and the Xerostomia Inventory were used to assess OHRQoL and xerostomia severity, respectively.Participants whose xerostomia worsened over the 5-year period had a significantly poorer follow-up OHRQoL. Linear regression models showed that tooth loss and worsening xerostomia were significant predictors of poorer follow-up OHRQoL.Tooth loss and worsening xerostomia result in poorer OHRQoL among older Japanese people.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842448","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.558619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.519011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.397256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Xerostomia","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerostomia"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Tooth loss","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_loss"},{"name":"Linear equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"List of Kakapo","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kakapo"},{"name":"Horse care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_care"},{"name":"Japanese people","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_people"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0141339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
