{"id":47637,"title":"[Relationship between effect of lamivudine in the treatment of cirrhotic patients with uncompensated hepatitis B with HBV genotypes and cytotoxic T lymphocyte].","abstract":"To explore relationship between effect of Lamivudine in the treatment of cirrhotic patients with uncompensated hepatitis B with hepatitis B virus (HBV)genotypes and HBV specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).80 cases of uncompensated cirrhotic hepatitis B (40 cases with genotype B and 40 with genotype C), HBV DNA positive, HBeAg positive and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 positive,were treated with Lamivudine 100 mg/d, one year later, its effect and relationship with HBV genotypes and HBV specific CTL were observed.HBV DNA turned negative:40 cases with genotype B turned negative (100%). In the 9th and 10th month of treatment, there was one case with genotype C had YMDD variation respectively and Adefovir dipivoxil was used for treatment, of the rest 38 cases, HBV DNA of 26 cases (68.42%) turned negative,HBV DNA negative rate of patients with genotype is lower than that of patients with genotype B, chi2 = 14.91, P < 0.01. HBeAg turned negative: 18 cases with genotype B (45%) turned negative, more than that of patients with genotype C (7 cases, 18.42%), chi2 = 6.32, P < 0.05. Peripheral blood HBV specific CTL level: before treatment, it was (0.33 +/- 0.03)% of patients with genotype B,higher than that of patients with genotype C [(0.11 +/- 0.02)%], t = 8.12, P < 0.001. 1 year after treatment: it was (0.44 +/- 0.04)% of patients with genotype B, higher than that before treatment, t = 4.01, P < 0.001, it was also higher than that of patients with genotype C 1 year after treatment [(0.23 +/- 0.03)%], t = 5.63, P < 0.01, alanine amino-transferase (ALT) returned to normal: 38 cases with genotype B (95%) returned to normal, more than that of patients with genotype C (28 cases, 73.68%), X2 = 6.79, P < 0.01.Effect of Lamivudinein the treatment of cirrhotic patients with uncompensated hepatitis B is better in patients with genotype B than patients with genotype C, its mechanism may be related to lower level of HBV specific CTL in patients with genotype C than patients with genotype B.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579476","annotations":[{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Lamivudine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.869075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.863041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.840197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.477028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.329395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Adefovir","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adefovir"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
