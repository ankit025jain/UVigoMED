{"id":66008,"title":"Is an abnormal vascular response after renal sympathetic denervation predictive of permanent damage? An unusual case of late renal artery stenosis after energy delivery.","abstract":"To describe the effect of renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) on renal arteries immediately after the procedure and at follow-up.A 52-year-old woman with severe resistant hypertension underwent RDN. A transient spasm occurred in the left renal artery immediately after radiofrequency energy delivery, with subsequent complete resolution without any additional therapy. At 6-month follow-up, the blood pressure increased, and imaging revealed a tight stenosis in the left renal artery, which was successfully treated with a stent. In the next days, there was an immediate significant blood pressure reduction.Renal denervation can be complicated by local tissue injury at the ablation sites that could be a possible trigger of late arterial disease.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754277","annotations":[{"name":"Renal artery stenosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery_stenosis"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Spasm","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.701208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.605914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Renal vein","weight":0.445905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_vein"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.369364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.218501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Radiofrequency ablation","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofrequency_ablation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.165412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_thoracic_sympathectomy"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
