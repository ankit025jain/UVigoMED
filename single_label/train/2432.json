{"id":2432,"title":"[A new system for noninvasive esophageal varices pressure measurement based on airflow and laser technology].","abstract":"Combined the optical principle with automatic control technology and computer real-time image detection technology to develop a non-contact system for noninvasive esophageal varices pressure measurement.The system included the adjustable air pump, laser device, image collection and analysis program. The feasibility and accuracy of the system were verified by in vitro experiments.The bionic vascular pressure measured by this system had good correlation and repeatability with the actual pressure.This system is accurate, feasible and has good application prospects.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25330601","annotations":[{"name":"Technology","weight":0.815177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Pressure measurement","weight":0.760458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_measurement"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.726259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.60121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Aerodynamics","weight":0.4935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics"},{"name":"Control system","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.282573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.132057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Real-time computer graphics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Automatic transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Repeatability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeatability"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Bionics","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionics"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"}]}
