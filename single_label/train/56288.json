{"id":56288,"title":"Second glaucoma drainage devices in refractory pediatric glaucoma: failure by fibrovascular ingrowth.","abstract":"To evaluate initial glaucoma drainage device failure and subsequent glaucoma drainage device placement for refractory pediatric glaucoma.Retrospective interventional case series.The Duke University surgical records from a single surgeon from 1997 to 2012 were reviewed for patients having at least 2 glaucoma drainage devices for refractory pediatric glaucoma. Data collected included glaucoma diagnosis, age at surgery, surgical interventions, preoperative/postoperative IOP and medications, and complications. Failure was defined as having an IOP >21 mm Hg (or clinically inadequate), and/or IOP-reducing surgery/devastating complication.Forty-three eyes (37 patients) had 2 or more glaucoma drainage devices. Mean age at second glaucoma drainage device implantation was 9.2 ± 7.1 years, with mean IOP 30 ± 11 mm Hg, on 3 ± 1 IOP-lowering medications. Fibrovascular ingrowth was documented during second glaucoma drainage device surgery in 12 of 43 eyes (28%), occurring only in Ahmed devices, at a mean of 70 months (range 11-153) after initial implantation. Failure of the second glaucoma drainage device surgery occurred in 18 of 43 eyes (42%) at mean 26.1 ± 32.2 months (median 19.3 months). Surgical success of second glaucoma drainage devices (Kaplan-Meier analysis) at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years was 81%, 62%, and 50%, respectively.Single glaucoma drainage device surgery fails to control IOP in some eyes with refractory pediatric glaucoma. Second glaucoma drainage device implantation offers a treatment option with modest success over time. Fibrovascular ingrowth should be suspected as a relatively common cause of IOP elevation and failure after Ahmed device implantation.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709812","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.575428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.530904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Duke University","weight":0.519348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.403889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.383167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.251738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0672669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"John Wayne","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Real options valuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_options_valuation"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Vascular tissue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_tissue"},{"name":"Failure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
