{"id":37083,"title":"Improved mitral valve performance after transapical aortic valve implantation.","abstract":"Concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) is frequently present before the performance of transapical aortic valve implantation (TA-AVI). Our aim was to study the impact of MR on outcome and the effect of TA-AVI on MR using the Edwards SAPIEN prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA).A total of 439 patients aged 81.5±6.4 years, 64.0% of whom were women, underwent TA-AVI between February 2006 and August 2011. The mean logistic EuroSCORE was 29.7%±15.7% and the mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score was 11.4%±7.6%. Outcome was assessed in patients with absent (9.8%), mild or trivial (58.5%), moderate (29.7%), and severe (2.0%) MR by pre- and postoperative echocardiography.Patients with moderate/severe MR versus mild or trivial MR had an increased in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 3.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.79-8.84; p=0.001) but a comparable 4-year survival (adjusted HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.47-3.49; p=0.623). During postoperative echocardiographic examination, there was an overall improvement in mitral incompetence (absent in 23.6%, mild in 58.6%, moderate in 17.8%, and severe in none). Independent multivariate variables associated with improved MR were MR greater than 1+ (odds ratio [OR], 7.73; p<0.001), the presence of functional MR (OR, 3.66; p=0.011), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60% or more (OR, 3.28; p=0.002), and a mean transaortic gradient (OR, 1.03; p=0.005).Moderate/severe MR before TA-AVI is associated with an increased early, but a comparable late, mortality. We observed an overall improved mitral valve performance, possibly resulting from reducing both subvalvular traction and closure forces acting on the mitral valve.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518576","annotations":[{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.819817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.72565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.692071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.619924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Mitral regurgitation","weight":0.615793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_regurgitation"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.588649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.52159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.34415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.125189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Irvine, California","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine,_California"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Regurgitation (circulation)","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(circulation)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Acting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"623","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/623"},{"name":"798","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/798"},{"name":"1 metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_metre"},{"name":"Natural satellite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Traction (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(engineering)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Frederick Wallace Edwards","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Wallace_Edwards"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"},{"name":"The Gamble (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamble_(The_O.C.)"}]}
