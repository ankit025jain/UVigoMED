{"id":90041,"title":"Meta-analysis of risk factors for the second hip fracture (SHF) in elderly patients.","abstract":"This study aims to quantitatively summarize the risk factors for the incidence of SHF. A meta-analysis was performed with the data obtained from 22 relevant papers published in Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane central database (all through January 2014) following strict selection. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for potential risk factors associated with SHF. Our meta-analysis indicated the significant risk factors for SHF were female (OR, 1.46; 95%CI, 1.29-1.66), living in institutions (OR, 2.23; 95%CI, 1.29-3.83), osteoporosis (Singh index (SI) 1-3) (OR, 10.02; 95%CI, 5.41-18.57), low vision (OR, 2.09; 95%CI, 1.06-4.12), dementia (OR, 1.89; 95%CI, 1.47-2.43), Parkinson (OR, 2.90; 95%CI, 1.41-5.95), cardiac diseases (OR, 1.32; 95%CI, 1.02-1.70) and respiratory disease (OR, 1.97; 95%CI, 1.16-3.32). Related strategies must be implemented on those involved with above-mentioned medical conditions to effectively prevent a SHF.
