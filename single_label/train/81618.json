{"id":81618,"title":"Effect of chlorhexidine on bond strength between glass-fiber post and root canal dentine after six month of water storage.","abstract":"Aim of this study was to assess the influence of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) application on bond strength of glass fibre reinforced composite (FRC) posts to root dentine using adhesive luting systems. Forty extracted human mandibular premolars were endodontically treated and root canals were prepared. Teeth were divided into 2 groups according to luting system as SuperBond C&B (etch-and-rinse/chemical cure) and FuturaBond DC (self-etch/ dual cure). Each group was further divided in 2 subgroups (n=10) according to whether CHX was applied or not. Group Futura/CHX: FuturaBond DC + CHX; group Futura: FuturaBond DC; group Super/CHX: Super Bond C&B + CHX; group Super: SuperBond C&B + CHX. Mean and standard deviation (in parenthesis) values of bond strength in MPa were: group Futura/CHX: 8.86 (1.96), group Futura: 7.65 (1.01), group Super/CHX: 17.47(2.93), group Super: 12.41 (3.83). Bond strength values were affected by the type of luting agent and CHX irrigation (p=0.001, two-way ANOVA). There were statistically significant differences among the groups according to one-way ANOVA (p<0.001). Significant differences were observed in bond strength between groups Super/CHX and Super (p=0.023), between groups Futura/CHX and Super/CHX (p<0.001). Application of CHX before luting procedure with etch-and-rinse/chemical cure luting agent of glass FRC post improved long-term bond strength between glass FRC and root dentine.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922997","annotations":[{"name":"Water","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Pascal (unit)","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"},{"name":"Chlorhexidine","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.163905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Fiberglass","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Order of the Bath","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Root canal","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_canal"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Direct current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current"},{"name":"Futura (typeface)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Warehouse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse"},{"name":"Aim (musician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_(musician)"},{"name":"7.65x21mm Parabellum","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.65x21mm_Parabellum"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0151736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Bond strength","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_strength"},{"name":"Endodontic therapy","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontic_therapy"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"}]}
