{"id":79422,"title":"[Mediafixation of the vocal cord through the external approach in the patients presenting with unilateral laryngeal paralysis].","abstract":"The objective of the present work was to develop a method for the modification of the vocal cord during the treatment of the patients presenting with unilateral laryngeal paralysis taking into consideration individual peculiarities of stereotopometric characteristics of the larynx in the subjects of different gender, neck structure, and body constitution. The earlier proposed method of laryngostereotopometry was employed in this study. The following body features were measured prior to surgery: the total length, acromial diameter, chest circumference, neck length and circumference; the degree of the fissure of glottis closure was measured by transnasal fibrolaryngoscopy. The transplant was cut out of the quadrangular cartilage of the nasal septum in the form of a prism having the base shaped as an isosceles triangle with the base equal to the width of the fissure of glottis; the vertical and horizontal sizes of the transplant were calculated from the formulas of multiple linear regression analysis. The autotransplant was introduced through the \"window\" in the plate of the shield-like cartilage between its internal perichondrium and the thyroarytenoid muscle of the arytenoid cartilage of the paralysed vocal cord in the horizontal direction in front of the site of attachment of the vocal cord of arytenoids cartilage up to the projection of the anterior commissure with fixation to the shield-like cartilage by a ligature.
