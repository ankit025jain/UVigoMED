{"id":16887,"title":"MicroRNA-155 induction by Mycobacterium bovis BCG enhances ROS production through targeting SHIP1.","abstract":"Macrophages play a critical role in the host immune response against mycobacterial infection. Our previous study has demonstrated that microRNA-155 (miR-155), one of the most important small non-coding RNAs in the immune system, promotes oxygen-independent mycobacterial killing in macrophages. However, little is known regarding the role of miR-155 in modulating oxygen-dependent mycobactericidal response in macrophages, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). In the present study, we demonstrated that miR-155 was increased in macrophages after Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) infection. Moreover, the BCG-induced upregulation of miR-155 in macrophages was dependent on TLR2, NF-?B and JNK signaling pathways. More importantly, our study explored that miR-155 significantly elevated ROS production in macrophages, although miR-155 had no influence on the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression or nitric oxide (NO) production. In addition, our study demonstrated that miR-155 repressed the expression of src homology 2 (SH2) containing inositol 5-phosphatase1 (SHIP1), and knockdown of SHIP1 greatly increased ROS production in BCG-infected macrophages. Collectively, these data indicate that miR-155 modulates ROS but not RNS production by targeting SHIP1, which may provide a better understanding of the host anti-mycobacterial response.
