{"id":37596,"title":"Valve-sparing root replacement surgery for the truncal valve in an adult: report of the initial successful case.","abstract":"We describe here an initial successful case of valve-sparing surgery using reimplantation technique in a 24-year-old male with aortic root dilatation with truncal valve insufficiency after common arterial trunk repair. Concomitant right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene was also successfully performed. He was discharged homeÂ on postoperative day 10 without stenosis or regurgitation of repaired valves. He is in New York Heart Association class I condition without any anticoagulant agents 6 months after operation. Of course, careful follow-up will be needed though our early result is acceptable.
