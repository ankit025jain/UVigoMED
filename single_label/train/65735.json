{"id":65735,"title":"The impact of multiparametric pelvic magnetic resonance imaging on risk stratification in patients with localized prostate cancer.","abstract":"To determine the impact of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) of the prostate on established risk stratification criteria in patients with clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate (ACP).The cohort included 71 patients who underwent MP-MRI of the prostate at a tertiary care referral center as part of their initial workup for ACP. Tumor characteristics comprising traditional risk stratification criteria (prostate-specific antigen, clinical T stage, and biopsy Gleason score) were recorded, and the initial National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group was calculated. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group was then recalculated incorporating MRI findings. The impact of MRI findings on changes in risk group classification was evaluated using the Stuart-Maxwell test. For patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, MRI findings were correlated with pathologic findings.The cohort included 11 (15.5%), 39 (54.9%), and 21 patients (29.6%) with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease, respectively. MRI findings led to risk group upstaging in 12 cases (16.9%). The highest yield was demonstrated in patients with intermediate-risk disease, in whom MRI led to upstaging in 25.6% of patients. There was a significant difference between pre-MRI and post-MRI risk group classifications (P<.01) for the entire cohort. Compared with radical prostatectomy specimens, the specificity of MRI for T3 disease was 92.9%.In our cohort of patients undergoing MP-MRI for previously untreated, clinically localized ACP, MRI findings led to changes in risk stratification in a substantial proportion of patients. Our findings support the use of MP-MRI in the workup of patients with localized ACP.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785987","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.851478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.761885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.756375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.688645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.584805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"National Comprehensive Cancer Network","weight":0.560555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Comprehensive_Cancer_Network"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.408898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.376722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.361396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.220642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.190311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African,_Caribbean_and_Pacific_Group_of_States"},{"name":"Blocking (stage)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(stage)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"The National (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(band)"},{"name":"92.9 (Perth radio station)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/92.9_(Perth_radio_station)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.0131816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"}]}
