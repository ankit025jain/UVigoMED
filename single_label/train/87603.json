{"id":87603,"title":"[War casualty triage during the First World War].","abstract":"Along with the front hospitals (HOE), the action of sorting out the injured was one of the most important innovations of the Great War. Progressively, it was implemented and codified on each level of the evacuating chain, with variations due to the different phases of the conflict, such as in Verdun or in the Somme. From 1917 onwards, specific sorting centers, managed by experimented soldiers, were set up in the evacuating hospitals.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069357","annotations":[{"name":"World War I","weight":0.875192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Battle of the Somme","weight":0.66717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme"},{"name":"Verdun","weight":0.565528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdun"},{"name":"War","weight":0.534488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"},{"name":"Somme","weight":0.45519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somme"},{"name":"Soldier","weight":0.401498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier"},{"name":"Casualty (person)","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_(person)"},{"name":"Triage","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.277566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Battle of Greece","weight":0.0898588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Greece"},{"name":"Codification (law)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law)"},{"name":"First World","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World"},{"name":"Action film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film"},{"name":"Sorting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting"},{"name":"Variation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_(music)"},{"name":"Phase (combat)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(combat)"},{"name":"1917","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1917"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
