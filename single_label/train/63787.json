{"id":63787,"title":"Pregnancy outcomes following recovery from acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.","abstract":"Pregnancy may precipitate acute episodes of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), but pregnancy outcomes in women who have recovered from acquired TTP are not well documented. We analyzed pregnancy outcomes following recovery from TTP associated with acquired, severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (ADAMTS13 activity <10%) in women enrolled in the Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry from 1995 to 2012. We also systematically searched for published reports on outcomes of pregnancies following recovery from TTP associated with acquired, severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. Ten women in the Oklahoma Registry had 16 subsequent pregnancies from 1999 to 2013. Two women had recurrent TTP, which occurred 9 and 29 days postpartum. Five of 16 pregnancies (31%, 95% confidence interval, 11%-59%) in 3 women were complicated by preeclampsia, a frequency greater than US population estimates (2.1%-3.2%). Thirteen (81%) pregnancies resulted in normal children. The literature search identified 382 articles. Only 6 articles reported pregnancies in women who had recovered from TTP associated with acquired, severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, describing 10 pregnancies in 8 women. TTP recurred in 6 pregnancies.With prospective complete follow-up, recurrent TTP complicating subsequent pregnancies in Oklahoma patients is uncommon, but the occurrence of preeclampsia may be increased. Most pregnancies following recovery from TTP in Oklahoma patients result in normal children.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398329","annotations":[{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.823868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.411798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.287801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombotic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Purpura","weight":0.262707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"ADAMTS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADAMTS"},{"name":"Oklahoma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma"},{"name":"ADAMTS13","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADAMTS13"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"1159","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1159"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"List of U.S. states and territories by population","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Census","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Network Ten","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Ten"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
