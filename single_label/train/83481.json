{"id":83481,"title":"The role of the built environment and assistive devices for outdoor mobility in later life.","abstract":"Despite theoretical advances in our conceptualization of disability, the \"environment\" remains a largely unspecified term in disablement models. The purpose of this research is to draw upon on a unique state-of-the-art nationally representative data set with innovative measures that provide the opportunity to tease apart and specify the role of different environmental factors in the disablement process.Using multinomial logistic regression with data from the first round of the recently launched National Health and Aging Trends Study (N = 6,578 community-dwelling Americans age 65+), this paper examines the role of the built environment (e.g., stairs or ramps leading up to the home) and mobility devices on reported difficulty going outside by oneself.Almost three quarters of community-dwelling older Americans live in a residence that has stairs at the entrance. Older adults who use a walker to help them get around are adversely affected by stairs at the entrance to their home, effectively doubling the odds of reporting difficulty going outside independently. Roughly 10% of community-dwelling older Americans live in a residence with a ramp at the entryway, which reduces the odds of outdoor mobility difficulty threefold among those using wheeled mobility devices. However, ramps at the entryway are associated with a higher likelihood of reporting difficulty going outdoors among those who do not use any type of mobility device.A better understanding of the complexities of the environment in the disablement process is critical for the planning and development of age-friendly environments allowing older adults to age in place.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25342826","annotations":[{"name":"Theory","weight":0.58647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.376707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.297581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Built environment","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built_environment"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.090992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Multinomial logit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logit"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Mobility aids","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobility_aids"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Stairway","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway"},{"name":"Drawing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Inclined plane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclined_plane"},{"name":"578","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/578"},{"name":"Ship naming and launching","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_naming_and_launching"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Multinomial distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution"},{"name":"Fad","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fad"},{"name":"Outdoors","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outdoors"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Teasing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teasing"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"National Health","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Entryway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entryway"}]}
