{"id":76063,"title":"[Special features of mild cognitive impairment in patients with metabolic syndrome].","abstract":"Aim: to establish special features of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with chronic insufficiency of cerebral circulation (CICC) with metabolic syndrome (MS) depending on the age of patients. Investigation involved 282 patients aged 45-89 with CICC. All the patients also were divided into three groups depending on age; each group was divided into two subgroups: with MS and without it. Total MMSE score in patients with MS and without it of all age groups was not significantly different. We found significant difference between groups of patients in some MMSE tests: orientation in time, orientation in space, remembering of three words, attention and count, words reproduction. Presence of MS in patients with MCI syndrome of all age groups negatively influenced on such cognitive functions as: storage and reproduction of information, attention, orientation in time (processes depicting state of executive functions). In patients with MS, comparing with those without MS, we found significantly worse characteristics of immediate and delayed memory for verbal stimuli, especially in old aged patients, the rate of sensorimotor reactions, mental capacity, the amount of active attention of patients on tables Schulte, information processing speed and attention according to SCWT for all age groups.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
