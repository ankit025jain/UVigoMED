{"id":52723,"title":"[Diabetes mellitus-related oxidative stress and its parameters in saliva].","abstract":"The uncontrolled accumulation of glucose and fatty acids in the human body without the possibility of any cells utilizing them as metabolic substrates is a typical occurrence in the process of diabetes mellitus. High concentration of mentioned substances leads to oxidative stress and that reasons in numerous complications as a result of diabetes which are often demonstrated in the oral cavity as periodontal inflammations. There are many ways to study the biomarkers of oxidative stress such as: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione, vitamins, lipid peroxidation, concentration of nitrites, non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins and hyperglycaemia in diabetes. Considering the attainability and simplicity required to collect, saliva is a popular research material used to test these biomarkers.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575653","annotations":[{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glutathione peroxidase","weight":0.825798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.814871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.732163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Nitrite","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrite"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.523648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.476084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Glutathione reductase","weight":0.453049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_reductase"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.444226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.177237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"}]}
