{"id":83047,"title":"Correlation of habits and clinical findings with histopathological diagnosis in oral submucosal fibrosis patients.","abstract":"Oral submucosal fibrosis (OSMF) is one of the most prevalent premalignant conditions in India which is easy to diagnose but difficult to manage. At present it is considered as irreversible and incurable. It has also been referred to as an epidemic in India.To correlate the frequency and duration of habits with clinical staging, functional staging and histopathological grading and to correlate the clinical and functional staging with histopathological grading.The study included a total of 90 subjects, 80 with OSMF in the experimental group and 10 patients in the control group. Patient personal history was recorded with chewing habits, including frequency and duration of chewing. The site of keeping the quid, time duration and whether he/she swallows it or spits it were also noted. Clinical staging was done on the presence of palpable fibrous bands. Functional staging was accomplished by measuring mouth opening. Incisional biopsy was done for all the patients for histopathological examination. Histopathological grading was according to Pindborg and Sirsat.The experimental group comprised 71 males and 9 females, the majority of which were in the age group of 21-30 years. Correlation of habits with clinical staging, functional staging and histopathological grading were significant (p<0.05). Clinical and functional staging did not correlate with histopathological grading, but the correlation of clinical and functional staging was highly significant (p<0.01).The widespread habit of chewing gutkha is a major risk factor for OSMF, especially in the younger age group. In this study, it was found that with increase in the duration and frequency of the habit the severity of the disease increased.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460253","annotations":[{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.820796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.726519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Precancerous condition","weight":0.55257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precancerous_condition"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.451744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"India","weight":0.4412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.291351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.258737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.203192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.144683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Gutka","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutka"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"22nd century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22nd_century_BC"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Pound sterling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling"},{"name":"Chewing tobacco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_tobacco"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS in India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_India"},{"name":"Incisional hernia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisional_hernia"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Swallow","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow"},{"name":"Habituation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habituation"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
