{"id":88416,"title":"NCCN bone health task force: key recommendations.","abstract":"For patients with advanced cancers involving bone, the standard of care for maintaining bone health is the use of antiresorptive therapies such as bisphosphonates, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, and denosumab. However, although long-term adverse events are rare and the risk-benefit ratio of these agents is usually markedly in favor of treatment, clinicians should be aware that they can occur. At the NCCN 19th Annual Conference, Dr. Azeez Farooki presented the key findings of the NCCN Bone Health Task Force, focusing on such topics as screening for osteoporosis; the controversial use of drug holidays from chronic bisphosphonate therapy; the provocative yet unclear story surrounding the potential anticancer benefits of antiresorptive agents; imaging for metastatic bone disease; and safety considerations linked to calcium supplements, vitamin D, and bone-strengthening agents.
