{"id":52519,"title":"Admixture mapping and subsequent fine-mapping suggests a biologically relevant and novel association on chromosome 11 for type 2 diabetes in African Americans.","abstract":"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease that disproportionately affects African Americans. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several loci that contribute to T2D in European Americans, but few studies have been performed in admixed populations. We first performed a GWAS of 1,563 African Americans from the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project and Northwestern University NUgene Project as part of the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. We successfully replicate an association in TCF7L2, previously identified by GWAS in this African American dataset. We were unable to identify novel associations at p<5.0Ã—10(-8) by GWAS. Using admixture mapping as an alternative method for discovery, we performed a genome-wide admixture scan that suggests multiple candidate genes associated with T2D. One finding, TCIRG1, is a T-cell immune regulator expressed in the pancreas and liver that has not been previously implicated for T2D. We performed subsequent fine-mapping to further assess the association between TCIRG1 and T2D in >5,000 African Americans. We identified 13 independent associations between TCIRG1, CHKA, and ALDH3B1 genes on chromosome 11 and T2D. Our results suggest a novel region on chromosome 11 identified by admixture mapping is associated with T2D in African Americans.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595071","annotations":[{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.862119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.820796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.624697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.587695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.423103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Northwestern University","weight":0.419348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.372202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.361745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.315792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Genome-wide association study","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"TCF7L2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCF7L2"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"European American","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_American"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Cartography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Vanderbilt University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"},{"name":"Miscegenation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscegenation"}]}
