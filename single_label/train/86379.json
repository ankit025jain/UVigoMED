{"id":86379,"title":"The changes of arterial blood gases in COPD during four-year period.","abstract":"COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible and that can lead to respiratory failure.To show the changes of arterial blood gases in COPD during the 4-year evolution of illness.The research was done on patients suffering from COPD treated at the Clinic \"Podhrastovi\" during 2006 and 2007 year. The tested parameters were examined from the date of receiving patient with COPD to hospital treatment in 2006 and 2007 and then followed prospectively until 2010 or 2011 year (the follow-up period was 4 years). There were total 199 treated patients who were chosen at random and regularly attended the control examinations. The study was conducted on adult patients of both sexes, different age group. In each patient the duration of illness was recorded so is sex, age, data of smoking habits, information about the regularity of taking bronchodilator therapy during remissions of disease, about the treatment of disease exacerbations, results of blood gases analysis as follows: pH value, PaO2 (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood), PaCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood). All these parameters were measured at the beginning and at the end of each hospital treatment. We took in elaboration data obtained in the beginning of the first hospitalization and at the end of the last hospitalization or at the last control in outpatient department when patient was in stable state. Patients were divided into three groups according to the number of exacerbations per year.There is the statistically significant decrease of PaO2 (p < 0.01) and pH, (p < 0.05) and an increase of PaCO2 (p < 0.01) during follow-up period. But in patients regularly treated in phases of remission and exacerbations of illness the course of illness is slower. The decrease of pH and PaO2 and increase of PaCO2 is statistically significantly smaller in those received regular treatment in phases of remissions (P values are respectively: < 0.05, < 0.01 and < 0.01) and exacerbations of illness (p values are respectively: < 0.01, < 0.01 and < 0.05).COPD is characterized with airflow limitation which is progressive in the course of illness, and by the changes in arterial blood gases that can lead to respiratory failure, but that course may be made slower using appropriate treatment during remission and exacerbations of diseases.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783904","annotations":[{"name":"Carbon
