{"id":25784,"title":"[Right ventricular dysfunction in advanced heart failure].","abstract":"The role of the right ventricle has often been underestimated in heart failure. It has been thought that the right cavity has a less prominent impact on symptoms, therapeutic approach, and prognosis. Right ventricular dysfunction is a complex issue and its diagnosis has acquired a relevant role, in particular with the improvement of new therapeutic options such as ventricular assist devices. The complex geometry of the right ventricle and its interaction with the left ventricle are still a matter of debate, leaving several open questions about the best therapeutic approach to manage right ventricular dysfunction. Echocardiography remains the first-line imaging technique, but an integrated multimodality evaluation with clinical, biochemical and hemodynamic parameters, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging can provide a more comprehensive way to choose the most appropriate treatment for patients with heart failure associated with right ventricular dysfunction.
