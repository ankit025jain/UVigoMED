{"id":73341,"title":"Effect of communication skills training program for oncologists based on patient preferences for communication when receiving bad news: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to identify the effects of a communication skills training (CST) program for oncologists, developed based on patient preferences regarding oncologists' communication.Thirty oncologists were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (IG; 2-day CST workshop) or control group (CG). Participants were assessed on their communication performance during simulated consultation and their confidence in communicating with patients at baseline and follow-up. A total of 1,192 patients (response rate, 84.6%) who had consultations with the participating oncologists at baseline and/or follow-up were assessed regarding their distress using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, satisfaction with the consultation, and trust in their oncologist after the consultation.At the follow-up survey, the performance scores of the IG had improved significantly, in terms of their emotional support (P = .011), setting up a supportive environment (P = .002), and ability to deliver information (P = .001), compared with those of the CG. Oncologists in the IG were rated higher at follow-up than those in the CG in terms of their confidence in themselves (P = .001). Patients who met with oncologists after they had undergone the CST were significantly less depressed than those who met with oncologists in the CG (P = .027). However, the CST program did not affect patient satisfaction with oncologists' style of communication.A CST program based on patient preferences is effective for both oncologists and patients with cancer. Oncologists should consider CST as an approach to enhancing their communication skills.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24912901","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.612878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.588297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.551911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.352099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.335087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"News","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Computer-generated imagery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery"},{"name":"Workshop","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workshop"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Trust (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Central Time Zone (North America)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Time_Zone_(North_America)"}]}
