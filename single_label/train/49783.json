{"id":49783,"title":"Preoperative octreotide treatment of acromegaly: long-term results of a randomised controlled trial.","abstract":"Randomised studies have demonstrated a beneficial effect of pre-surgical treatment with somatostatin analogues (SSA) in acromegaly when evaluated early postoperatively. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term surgical cure rates.Newly diagnosed patients were randomised to direct surgery (n=30) or 6-month pretreatment with octreotide LAR (n=32). The patients were evaluated 1 and 5 years postoperatively. Cure was defined as normal IGF1 levels and by normal IGF1 level combined with nadir GH <2?mU/l in an oral glucose tolerance test, all without additional post-operative treatment. A meta-analysis using the other published randomised study with long-term analyses on preoperative SSA treatment was performed.The proportion of patients receiving post-operative acromegaly treatment was equal in the two groups. When using the combined criteria for cure, 10/26 (38%) macroadenomas were cured in the pretreatment group compared with 6/25 (24%) in the direct surgery group 1 year postoperatively (P=0.27), and 9/22 (41%) vs 6/22 (27%) macroadenomas, respectively, 5 years postoperatively (P=0.34). In the meta-analysis, 16/45 (36%) macroadenomas were cured using combined criteria in the pretreatment group vs 8/45 (18%) in the direct surgery group after 6-12 months (P=0.06), and 15/41 (37%) vs 8/42 (19%), respectively, in the long-term (P=0.08).This study does not prove a beneficial effect of SSA pre-surgical treatment, but in the meta-analysis a trend towards significance can be claimed. A potential favourable, clinically relevant response cannot be excluded.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24866574","annotations":[{"name":"Acromegaly","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromegaly"},{"name":"Octreotide","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octreotide"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Somatostatin","weight":0.809346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.620296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.565672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1","weight":0.53424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.525596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.47403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.416574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"622","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/622"},{"name":"842","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/842"},{"name":"845","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/845"},{"name":"1026","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1026"},{"name":"1645","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1645"},{"name":"1541","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1541"},{"name":"922","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/922"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Laredo Heat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laredo_Heat"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Nadir","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"}]}
