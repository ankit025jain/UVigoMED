{"id":63317,"title":"Effect of the weekly administration of liposome-Paclitaxel combined with s-1 on advanced gastric cancer.","abstract":"This study is aimed to assess the efficacy and toxicity of weekly liposome-paclitaxel and S-1 combination therapy as first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer.The chemotherapy regime was 80 mg/m(2) liposome-paclitaxel given on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, combined with S-1 60 mg (body surface area > 1.5) or 50 mg (1.25 < body surface area < 1.5) twice a day on days 1-28, 6 weeks as one cycle. The patients continued to be treated until they received four cycles or until they developed either progressive disease or untolerated toxicity. The response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival and toxicity were evaluated.A total of 56 patients were enrolled, and the median age was 60 years (range = 38-70 years; 39 males and 17 females). The response rate and disease control rate were 25% (14/56) and 87.5% (49/56), respectively. The median progression-free survival was 6.1 months (95% confidence interval: 5.0-7.2), and the median overall survival was 10.6 months (95% confidence interval: 7.2-14.0). The most frequent hematological toxicities were neutropenia and anemia, which occurred in 22 (48.9%) and 11 (19.6%) patients, respectively.The weekly administration of a combined regimen of liposome-paclitaxel plus S-1 is effective and has a favorable toxicity profile for advanced gastric cancer.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24453274","annotations":[{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.774202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.519993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.479775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.433825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.376491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.291533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.207997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Body surface area","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_surface_area"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Surface area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"1456","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1456"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"Renault 9 & 11","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_9_&_11"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Progressive rock","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
