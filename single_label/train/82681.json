{"id":82681,"title":"Association of interleukin-1? -511 C/T polymorphism with tobacco-associated cancer in northeast India: a study on oral and gastric cancer.","abstract":"The IL-1? -511 C/T polymorphism is associated with increased IL-1 production and with increased risk of developing cancers. In this study, 251 patients (125 with gastric cancer [GC] and 126 with oral cancer [OC]) and 207 normal controls from northeast (NE) India were genotyped for the IL-1? -511 C/T polymorphism by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequencing. Analysis of results showed betel-quid chewing to be a major risk factor (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.05-3.87; P = 0.035) for OC. Inheritance of the IL-1? -511 CT or TT resulted in a 2.6- to 3.05-fold increase in the risk of developing OC relative to that of participants who possessed the reference genotype (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.06-6.22; P = 0.036 and OR = 3.05, 95% CI = 1.22-7.63; P = 0.017), after adjusting for potential confounders. The dominant genetic model also confirmed the presence of the T allele as a significant risk factor for OC (OR = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.15-6.42; P = 0.02). In GC, interaction of the CT genotype with tobacco and betel-quid chewing habits conferred a significant 78% and 89% reduced risk of cancer, respectively. In conclusion, for the NE Indian population, the IL-1? -511 CC and CT genotypes were significantly associated with increased risk of OC. However, the interaction of the CT genotype with risk habits may play a preventive role for GC but not for OC.
