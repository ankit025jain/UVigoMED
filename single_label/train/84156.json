{"id":84156,"title":"How the misincorporation of ribonucleotides into genomic DNA can be both harmful and helpful to cells.","abstract":"Ribonucleotides are misincorporated into replicating DNA due to the similarity of deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides, the high concentration of ribonucleotides in the nucleus and the imperfect accuracy of replicative DNA polymerases in choosing the base with the correct sugar. Embedded ribonucleotides change certain properties of the DNA and can interfere with normal DNA transactions. Therefore, misincorporated ribonucleotides are targeted by the cell for removal. Failure to remove ribonucleotides from DNA results in an increase in genome instability, a phenomenon that has been characterized in various systems using multiple assays. Recently, however, another side to ribonucleotide misincorporation has emerged, where there is evidence for a functional role of misinserted ribonucleotides in DNA, leading to beneficial consequences for the cell. This review examines examples of both positive and negative effects of genomic ribonucleotide misincorporation in various organisms, aiming to highlight the diversity and the utility of this common replication variation.
