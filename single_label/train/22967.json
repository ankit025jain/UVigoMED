{"id":22967,"title":"Prophylactic antibiotics for hemorrhoidectomy: are they really needed?","abstract":"Hemorrhoidectomy is considered by many to be a contaminated operation that requires antibiotic prophylaxis to lower the incidence of surgical site infection. In reality, little evidence exists to either support or refute the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in this setting.This study aimed to determine if antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with reduced incidence of postoperative surgical site infection following hemorrhoidectomy.This is a retrospective database review.This study was conducted at multiple institutions.All patients undergoing hemorrhoidectomy with minimum 3-month follow-up were included.The primary outcome measure was the incidence of postoperative surgical site infection.Eight hundred fifty-two patients met the inclusion criteria (50.1% female; mean age, 50.0 Â± 13.7 years). The prevalence of preoperative risk factors for surgical site infection included 7.7% with a smoking history, 2.5% with diabetes mellitus, 0.8% receiving steroids, and 0.2% with Crohn's disease. Surgery was performed predominately for 3-column prolapsed internal and mixed internal/external hemorrhoidal disease. All surgeries performed were closed hemorrhoidectomies. Antibiotic prophylaxis was used in a fewer number of cases (41.3% vs 58.7%). Overall, there were only 12 documented postoperative infections identified, producing an overall incidence of 1.4%. Of those patients who developed postoperative surgical site infections, 9 (75%) did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis (p = 0.25). On multivariate regression analysis, no perioperative risk factor was associated with an increased risk of developing a posthemorrhoidectomy surgical site infection. Conversely, there were no adverse antibiotic-related complications such as Clostridium difficile colitis or antibiotic-associated diarrhea in those receiving antibiotic prophylaxis.This study was limited by the retrospective nature of the analysis.Postoperative surgical site infection is an exceedingly rare event following hemorrhoidectomy. Antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce the incidence of postoperative surgical site infection, and its routine use appears unnecessary.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509461","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.814388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.766461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.59426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.563317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.467318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.388934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.369629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.228971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Hemorrhoid","weight":0.154468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemorrhoid"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.15119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Antimicrobial prophylaxis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_prophylaxis"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"}]}
