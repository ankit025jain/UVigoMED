{"id":47608,"title":"[Efficacy and safety of combination of sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization in treating primary hepatocellular carcinoma].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)in the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The clinical data of 10 patients with unresectable HCC treated by sorafenib combined with TACE in the Department of Radiology, the First Hospital of China Medical University were retrospectively analyzed. The efficacy was evaluated according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors assessment. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Safety was evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.Among the 10 patients, 2 achieved complete response, 3 achieved partial response, 3 achieved stable disease, and 2 experienced progressive disease. The median overall survival of the cohort was 29.5 months. Different degree of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred in 9 patients but all were at grade 3 or lower. The most common ADRs were hand-foot skin reaction (7/10) and diarrhea (6/10).The combination of sorafenib and TACE is an effective and safe treatment for HCC.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581125","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular
