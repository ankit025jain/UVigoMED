{"id":37434,"title":"[One case of 2q37 deletion syndrome: clinical and genetic diagnosis].","abstract":"To diagnose a new born baby with 2q37 deletion syndrome by comprehensive use of cytogenetic and molecular techniques and to investigate the phenotype characteristics and applicability of array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for detection of this syndrome.Following conventional chromosome preparation, G banded karyotyping was performed.Genomic DNA was extracted using standard procedures, which were then analyzed by array-CGH and MLPA.The patient presented with a typical face, special fist posture and congenital heart disease in 2q37 deletion syndrome. A 4.709 Mb deletion at 2q37.3 (chr2:237, 967, 852-242, 677, 269.NCBI36/hg18, including genes from COL6A3 toPDCD1) was detected by array-CGH. The results of MLPA and G banded karyotyping confirmed the existence of this deletion.2q37.3 deletion was determined to be the cryptic cause of this case.2q37 deletion syndrome has some clinically recognizable characteristics. And array-CGH is a powerful technique for the accurate diagnosis and genotype-phenotype correlation study of this syndrome.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495766","annotations":[{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Preimplantation genetic diagnosis","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.658103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.643841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"National Center for Biotechnology Information","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Megabase","weight":0.347996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabase"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.22596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Crypsis","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypsis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification","weight":0.0272758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_ligation-dependent_probe_amplification"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Multiplexing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing"}]}
