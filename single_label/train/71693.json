{"id":71693,"title":"Cancer staging in outcomes assessment.","abstract":"The T N M staging system created by a surgeon in the 1950s continues to be a major benchmark for assessing long-term outcomes in adult solid tumors. Although several major changes have occurred in this anatomical staging system, the tenets of TNM staging remain constant. Recently molecular markers and biologic modifiers have been added to this anatomical staging system to create a more robust outcomes tool.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25043160","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.537146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.302953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.213774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.184317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0254274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"1950s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950s"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Grammatical modifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_modifier"},{"name":"Academic major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major"},{"name":"1950","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950"}]}
