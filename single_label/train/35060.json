{"id":35060,"title":"Drug-induced brugada syndrome in children: clinical features, device-based management, and long-term follow-up.","abstract":"The goal of this study was to investigate the clinical features, management, and long-term follow-up of children with drug-induced Brugada syndrome (BS).Patients with BS <12 years of age with a spontaneous type I electrocardiogram have a higher risk of arrhythmic events. Data on drug-induced BS in patients <12 years of age are lacking.Among 505 patients with ajmaline-induced BS, subjects ?12 years of age at the time of diagnosis were considered as children and eligible for this study.Forty children (60% male; age 8 ± 2.8 years) were included. Twenty-four children (60%) had a family history of sudden death. Two (5%) had a previous episode of aborted sudden death, and 8 (20%) had syncope. Children experienced more frequent episodes of sinus node dysfunction (SND) compared with older subjects (7.5% vs. 1.5%; p = 0.04) and had a comparable incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias. Children more frequently experienced episodes of ajmaline-induced sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) compared with older patients (10.0% vs. 1.3%; p = 0.005). Twelve children (30%) received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). After a mean follow-up time of 83 ± 51 months, none of the children died suddenly. Spontaneous sustained VAs were documented in 1 child (2%). Among children with ICD, 1 (8%) experienced an appropriate shock, 4 (33%) had inappropriate ICD shocks, and 4 (33%) experienced device-related complications.Drug-induced BS is associated with atrial arrhythmias and SND. Children are at higher risk of ajmaline-induced VAs. The rate of device-related complications, leading to lead replacement or inappropriate shocks, is considerable and even higher than with appropriate interventions. Based on these findings, the optimal management of BS in childhood should remain individualized, taking into consideration the patient's clinical history and family's wishes.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681144","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Syncope (medicine)","weight":0.86437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.209085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.208715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Sinoatrial node","weight":0.161111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinoatrial_node"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Brugada syndrome","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugada_syndrome"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.113719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Electric shock","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_shock"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.0314217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Bachelor of Science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
