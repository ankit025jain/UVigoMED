{"id":42807,"title":"Epidemiology of hepatitis C virus in Pennsylvania state prisons, 2004-2012: limitations of 1945-1965 birth cohort screening in correctional settings.","abstract":"We described hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) prevalence in a state prison system and retrospectively evaluated the case-finding performance of targeted testing of the 1945 to 1965 birth cohort in this population.We used observational data from universal testing of Pennsylvania state prison entrants (June 2004-December 2012) to determine anti-HCV prevalence by birth cohort. We compared anti-HCV prevalence and the burden of anti-HCV in the 1945 to 1965 birth cohort with that in all other birth years.Anti-HCV prevalence among 101,727 adults entering prison was 18.1%. Prevalence was highest among those born from 1945 to 1965, but most anti-HCV cases were in people born after 1965. Targeted testing of the 1945 to 1965 birth cohort would have identified a decreasing proportion of cases with time.HCV is endemic in correctional populations. Targeted testing of the 1945 to 1965 birth cohort would produce a high yield of positive test results but would identify only a minority of cases. We recommend universal anti-HCV screening in correctional settings to allow for maximum case identification, secondary prevention, and treatment of affected prisoners.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825235","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.836937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.813286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Prison","weight":0.754488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.695533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.661375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.493064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.467347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0719954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"List of Pennsylvania state prisons","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pennsylvania_state_prisons"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"1945","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1945"},{"name":"1965","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1965"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"High-yield debt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-yield_debt"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"List of United States state prisons","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_state_prisons"},{"name":"Universal health care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Positive test","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_test"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Boeing 727","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_727"}]}
