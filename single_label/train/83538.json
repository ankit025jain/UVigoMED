{"id":83538,"title":"[Long-term results of postoperative electronic irradiation for 53 patients with keloids].","abstract":"To analyze the results of postoperative radiotherapy with electronic beam for patients with keloids in our hospital.From September 2006 to May 2009, radiotherapy was given within 24 hours after operation in 53 keloid patients. With single vertical field irradiation, 6-12 Mev electronic beams of Linear Accelerator were selected for different incision depth in different sites. The field size was 1.0 cm (range: 0.5-2.0 cm) away from both incision ends and 1.25 cm (range: 0.75-2.50 cm) away from incision laterally. The radiation was given daily with median treatment course of 4 days (range: 3-21 days) at 3.5 Gy/Fx to a median total dose of 14 Gy (range: 8-20 Gy). SPSS 21. 0 was used for analysis.All postoperative incisions healed in one stage, the median follow-up was 34 months (range: 18-63 months). The overall local control rate was 79.7%. For patients who received the dose of more than 14 Gy versus less than 14 Gy, the local control rate was 81.6%, 75.2%, respectively (P > 0.05). For male and female, the 3 year local recurrence rate were 45.3%, 9.9% respectively (P = 0.008). Multivariate analysis showed that the sex (male versus female) was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.036).Surgery combined with electronic beam irradiation is a rather effective way to treat keloids. The local control rate would have a better trend if the total dose was higher than 14 Gy. Sex is an independent prognostic factor.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322574","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.462518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.420555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.392335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.389433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Linear particle accelerator","weight":0.0451805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Keloid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Fresco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"1863","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1863"},{"name":"820","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/820"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Beam (structure)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(structure)"},{"name":"Beam (nautical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Range (particle radiation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(particle_radiation)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Radiation hardening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening"},{"name":"Particle accelerator","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator"}]}
