{"id":44306,"title":"Multiple visceral resection after locoregional recurrence of signet ring cell gastric cancer -- case report and literature review.","abstract":"Recurrence is the most important cause of treatment failure in patients with advanced gastric cancer, even after curative surgery. Surgery plays an important role in these patients,even in cases of multivisceral involvement. In selected cases good biological resources - surgery is the only viable choice to prolong survival. This report describes the case of a 41 year-old patient presenting a locoregional recurrence with multiple visceral involvement at 15 months after radical subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection for antral gastric cancer.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742419","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.724601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.672546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.480402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.274731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.207234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cardia","weight":0.149228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Signet ring cell","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signet_ring_cell"},{"name":"Seal (emblem)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(emblem)"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"}]}
