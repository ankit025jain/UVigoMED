{"id":80200,"title":"Men traveling away from home are more likely to bring malaria into high altitude villages, northwest Ethiopia.","abstract":"Information about malaria risk factors at high altitudes is scanty. Understanding the risk factors that determine the risk of malaria transmission at high altitude villages is important to facilitate implementing sustainable malaria control and prevention programs.An unmatched case control study was conducted among patients seeking treatment at health centers in high altitude areas. Either microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests were used to confirm the presence of plasmodium species. A generalized linear model was used to identify the predictors of malaria transmission in high altitude villages.Males (AOR?=?3.11, 95%CI: 2.28, 4.23), and those who traveled away from the home in the previous month (AOR?=?2.01, 95% CI: 1.56, 2.58) were strongly associated with presence of malaria in high altitude villages. Other significant factors, including agriculture in occupation (AOR?=?1.41, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.93), plants used for fencing (AOR?=?1.70, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.52) and forests near the house (AOR?=?1.60, 95% CI: 1.15, 2.47), were found predictors for malaria in high altitude villages.Travel outside of their home was an important risk of malaria infections acquisition. Targeting males who frequently travel to malarious areas can reduce malaria transmission risks in high altitude areas.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24748159","annotations":[{"name":"Ethiopia","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.765787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.363127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.34631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.331511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.276298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.270446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.244818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Case-control study","weight":0.140191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-control_study"},{"name":"Fencing","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Forest","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Generalized linear model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model"},{"name":"Album-oriented rock","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album-oriented_rock"},{"name":"House","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"},{"name":"Travel","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel"},{"name":"Altitude","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Alpine tundra","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_tundra"},{"name":"100 metres","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Community health center","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health_center"},{"name":"Linear model","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_model"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"}]}
