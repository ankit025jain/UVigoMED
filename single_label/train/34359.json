{"id":34359,"title":"Association between genes encoding components of the IL-4/IL-4 receptor pathway and dermatitis in children.","abstract":"To determine whether IL-4, IL-4R? and STAT6 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to dermatitis in Egyptian children.We genotyped three groups of children, consisting of 106 atopic dermatitis (AD) children, 95 non-AD children, and 100 of healthy controls, for IL-4 (-590 C/T), (-33 C/T), IL-4R? (I50V), (Q576R) and STAT6 (2964 G/A), (2892 C/T) gene polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP assay. Total serum IgE and serum IL-4 levels were detected by ELISA.There was a non-significant association of IL-4 -590 C/T, -33 C/T polymorphisms in the children with non-AD or those with AD when compared with the controls. We identified a significant association between IL-4R? I50V, Q576R polymorphisms and dermatitis susceptibility in AD (p=0.002, <0.001 respectively), whereas no such association was observed in non-AD group (p=0.52, 0.99 respectively). A significant association between STAT6 polymorphisms and both types of dermatitis was found. Patients who were carriers of IL4 -590C, IL-4R? I50V G, STAT6 2964 A and STAT6 2892 T had an increased risk of AD [OR and 95% CI: 3.2 (2.5-4.2), p=0.005]. Furthermore, there was no relation between each polymorphism and serum IL-4 level (p>0.05 for each) while homozygosity for the risk alleles of IL-4, IL-4R? and STAT6 SNPs were significantly associated with increased total IgE levels in all subjects.In Egyptian children, the IL-4R? and the STAT6 polymorphism may play a role in susceptibility to AD. In addition, gene-gene interaction between the IL-4, the IL-4R? and the STAT6 significantly increases an individual's susceptibility to AD.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742632","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.810789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.745251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Zygosity","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity"},{"name":"Interleukin-4 receptor","weight":0.207478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin-4_receptor"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.175556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.136252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Ancient Egypt","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"},{"name":"STAT6","weight":0.114525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT6"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.110833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.0510965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"590","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/590"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"576","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/576"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"}]}
