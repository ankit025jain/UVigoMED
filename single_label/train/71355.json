{"id":71355,"title":"Computed tomography-guided percutaneous permanent iodine-125 implantation for patients with malignant osseous tumors.","abstract":"In the present study, we evaluated the value of computed tomography-guided 125I implantation for malignant osseous tumors.Under computed tomography guidance, 125I seeds were implanted into malignant osseous tumors of 19 patients. The curative effect was evaluated according to the degree of ostealgia relief and the changes in radiological images.The 125I seeds were implanted successfully in all 19 cases. No complication was observed. Pain relief was obtained in 17 of the 19 malignant osseous tumor patients after implantation, and the effective rate was 89.5%. Follow-up computed tomography reexamination at 1, 2 and 6 months demonstrated that of the 25 lesions in 19 cases, obvious relief was obtained in 2, partial relief in 15, a slight decrease in 7, and a progressive decrease in 1. The response rate was 68%.Computed tomography-guided 125I implantation is a safe, effective and feasible method in the treatment of patients with malignant osseous tumors.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076241","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.837652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.810199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.764089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.722957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.459971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.363164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.248197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Iodine-125","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-125"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Progressive rock","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock"},{"name":"Reexamination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reexamination"}]}
