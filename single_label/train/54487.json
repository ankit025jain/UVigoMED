{"id":54487,"title":"miR-99a promotes proliferation targeting FGFR3 in human epithelial ovarian cancer cells.","abstract":"MiRNAs have been reported as important regulators in normal physiological processes, human cancer, and even their roles as therapeutic targets have been proposed. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the expression of miRNAs is reported to remarkably deregulate, showing that miRNAs are involved in the initiation and progression of this disease. In this study, we found that miR-99a was obviously decreased in EOC tissues, serums and cell lines SKOV-3. Importantly, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), predicted to be one target gene of miR-99a using computational algorithms, was higher in expression in EOC cells. Subsequently, FGFR3 was proved to be direct target of miR-99a by dual luciferase assay. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-99a dramatically suppressed expression level of FGFR3 at both mRNA and protein levels, proving FGFR3 to be inversely correlated with miR-99a. Finally, overexpression of miR-99a could significantly inhibit EOC cell proliferation in vitro by decreasing the expression of FGFR3 which also reduced the EOC cell growth after siRNA knockdown. Conclusively, miR-99a expression was remarkably downregulated in serums, tissues and cell and suppresses EOC cell proliferation by targeting FGFR3, suggesting miR-99a as a prospective prognosis marker and potential tumor suppressor for EOC therapeutics.
