{"id":12504,"title":"Enhancement of blood-brain barrier permeability and reduction of tight junction protein expression are modulated by chemokines/cytokines induced by rabies virus infection.","abstract":"Infection with laboratory-attenuated rabies virus (RABV) enhances blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, which has been demonstrated to be an important factor for host survival, since it allows immune effectors to enter the central nervous system (CNS) and clear RABV. To probe the mechanism by which RABV infection enhances BBB permeability, the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins in the CNS was investigated following intracranial inoculation with laboratory-attenuated or wild-type (wt) RABV. BBB permeability was significantly enhanced in mice infected with laboratory-attenuated, but not wt, RABV. The expression levels of TJ proteins (claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens-1) were decreased in mice infected with laboratory-attenuated, but not wt, RABV, suggesting that enhancement of BBB permeability is associated with the reduction of TJ protein expression in RABV infection. RABV neither infects the brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) nor modulates the expression of TJ proteins in BMECs. However, brain extracts prepared from mice infected with laboratory-attenuated, but not wt, RABV reduced TJ protein expression in BMECs. It was found that brain extracts from mice infected with laboratory-attenuated RABV contained significantly higher levels of inflammatory chemokines/cytokines than those from mice infected with wt RABV. Pathway analysis indicates that gamma interferon (IFN-?) is located in the center of the cytokine network in the RABV-infected mouse brain, and neutralization of IFN-? reduced both the disruption of BBB permeability in vivo and the downregulation of TJ protein expression in vitro. These findings indicate that the enhancement of BBB permeability and the reduction of TJ protein expression are due not to RABV infection per se but to virus-induced inflammatory chemokines/cytokines.Previous studies have shown that infection with only laboratory-attenuated, not wild-type, rabies virus (RABV) enhances blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, allowing immune effectors to enter the central nervous system (CNS) and clear RABV from the CNS. This study investigated the mechanism by which RABV infection enhances BBB permeability. It was found that RABV infection enhances BBB permeability by downregulation of tight junction (TJ) protein expression in the brain microvasculature. It was further found that it is not RABV infection per se but the chemokines/cytokines induced by RABV infection that downregulate the expression of TJ proteins and enhance BBB permeability. Blocking some of these cytokines, such as IFN-?, ameliorated both the disruption of BBB permeability and the downregulation of TJ protein expression. These studies may provide a foundation for developing therapeutics for clinical rabies, such as medication that could be used to enhance BBB permeability.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522913","annotations":[{"name":"Tight junction","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_junction"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Rabies","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.751881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Interferon-gamma","weight":0.709729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon-gamma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.57819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Blood-brain barrier","weight":0.578112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-brain_barrier"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.560387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.534242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.529262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Claudin","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudin"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Occludin","weight":0.0549863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occludin"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.0333955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Rabies virus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies_virus"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"}]}
