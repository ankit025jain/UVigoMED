{"id":61751,"title":"Therapeutic effects and influencing factors in sixty-eight cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified.","abstract":"To analyze the clinical characteristics, therapeutic short-term efficacy, long-term survival and influencing factors in 68 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified.Sixty-eight cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified were retrospectively studied. The effect of different treatments on survival of patients was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Using single factor analysis and the Cox proportional hazards regression model, the effect of the various clinical factors on the survival of patients was evaluated.The complete remission rate of 68 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified according to treatment was 28%. The 5-year overall survival rate was 25.63%. Chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy gave overall survival rates of 19.4% and 37.1%, respectively. Chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy gave a long-term survival rate significantly superior to that of chemotherapy alone (P <0.05).Patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified treated by the CHOP chemotherapy regimen had a high response rate but a low long-term survival rate. A complete remission with initial treatment and chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy can improve patient survival. The performance score before treatment, therapeutic effect, and bone marrow involvement are independent factors that affect survival.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675486","annotations":[{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.577663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.540985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.331707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.318376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.298926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"CHOP","weight":0.0557848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOP"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0341376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Factor analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Channel 37","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_37"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
