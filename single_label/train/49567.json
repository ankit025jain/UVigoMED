{"id":49567,"title":"Thyroid disease and cognition.","abstract":"Overt hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are associated with significant decrements in mood and cognitive function, and therapy usually leads to improvement in these symptoms. In contrast, major affective or cognitive dysfunction is not typical of subclinical thyroid disease. Subtle deficits in specific cognitive domains (primarily working memory and executive function) likely exist in subclinical hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis, but these are unlikely to cause major problems in most patients. Patients with mild thyroid disease and significant distress related to mood or cognition most likely have independent diagnoses that should be evaluated and treated separately.
