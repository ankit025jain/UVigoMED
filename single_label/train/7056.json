{"id":7056,"title":"Chickens host diverse picornaviruses originated from potential interspecies transmission with recombination.","abstract":"While chickens are an important reservoir for emerging pathogens such as avian influenza viruses, little is known about the diversity of picornaviruses in poultry. We discovered a previously unknown diversity of picornaviruses in chickens in Hong Kong. Picornaviruses were detected in 87 cloacal and 7 tracheal samples from 93 of 900 chickens by reverse transcription-PCR, with their partial 3D(pol) gene sequences forming five distinct clades (I to V) among known picornaviruses. Analysis of eight genomes from different clades revealed seven different picornaviruses, including six novel picornavirus species (ChPV1 from clade I, ChPV2 and ChPV3 from clade II, ChPV4 and ChPV5 from clade III, ChGV1 from clade IV) and one existing species (Avian encephalomyelitis virus from clade V). The six novel chicken picornavirus genomes exhibited distinct phylogenetic positions and genome features different from related picornaviruses, supporting their classification as separate species. Moreover, ChPV1 may potentially belong to a novel genus, with low sequence homologies to related picornaviruses, especially in the P1 and P2 regions, including the predicted L and 2A proteins. Nevertheless, these novel picornaviruses were most closely related to picornaviruses of other avian species (ChPV1 related to Passerivirus A, ChPV2 and ChPV3 to Avisivirus A and Duck hepatitis A virus, ChPV4 and ChPV5 to Melegrivirus A, ChGV1 to Gallivirus A). Furthermore, ChPV5 represented a potential recombinant picornavirus, with its P2 and P3 regions possibly originating from Melegrivirus A. Chickens are an important reservoir for diverse picornaviruses that may cross avian species barriers through mutation or recombination.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906980","annotations":[{"name":"Avian influenza","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza"},{"name":"Hepatitis A","weight":0.859295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A"},{"name":"Picornavirus","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picornavirus"},{"name":"Phylogenetic tree","weight":0.844261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree"},{"name":"Clade","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.789907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.750378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Influenza A virus","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.696914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.661374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.584737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.503266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Poultry","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.390388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.364424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Cloaca","weight":0.272369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca"},{"name":"Duck","weight":0.0347418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck"},{"name":"Hong Kong","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Invertebrate trachea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Biosafety level","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"}]}
