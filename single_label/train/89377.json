{"id":89377,"title":"Lifetime increased cancer risk in mice following exposure to clinical proton beam-generated neutrons.","abstract":"To evaluate the life span and risk of cancer following whole-body exposure of mice to neutrons generated by a passively scattered clinical spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) proton beam.Three hundred young adult female FVB/N mice, 152 test and 148 control, were entered into the experiment. Mice were placed in an annular cassette around a cylindrical phantom, which was positioned lateral to the mid-SOBP of a 165-MeV, clinical proton beam. The average distance from the edge of the mid-SOBP to the conscious active mice was 21.5 cm. The phantom was irradiated with once-daily fractions of 25 Gy, 4 days per week, for 6 weeks. The age at death and cause of death (ie, cancer and type vs noncancer causes) were assessed over the life span of the mice.Exposure of mice to a dose of 600 Gy of proton beam-generated neutrons, reduced the median life span of the mice by 4.2% (Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival, P=.053). The relative risk of death from cancer in neutron exposed versus control mice was 1.40 for cancer of all types (P=.0006) and 1.22 for solid cancers (P=.09). For a typical 60 Gy dose of clinical protons, the observed 22% increased risk of solid cancer would be expected to decrease by a factor of 10.Exposure of mice to neutrons generated by a proton dose that exceeds a typical course of radiation therapy by a factor of 10, resulted in a statistically significant increase in the background incidence of leukemia and a marginally significant increase in solid cancer. The results indicate that the risk of out-of-field second solid cancers from SOBP proton-generated neutrons and typical treatment schedules, is 6 to 10 times less than is suggested by current neutron risk estimates.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725699","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.728461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.725231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Neutron","weight":0.690852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.681076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.658814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Electronvolt","weight":0.608502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.567388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.500024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.485295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.405809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.263456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.146135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Bragg peak","weight":0.134423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg_peak"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Compact Cassette","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Cassette"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0481626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"William Henry Bragg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Bragg"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Semi-major axis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_axis"},{"name":"Ghost","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
