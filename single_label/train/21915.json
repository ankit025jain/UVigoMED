{"id":21915,"title":"Patients' perception of infection prevention in dental practice.","abstract":"Patient's perceptions of risk from bloodborne viruses (BBVs) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD) in relation to attendance at dental practice is understudied. This survey of an opportunistic sample of 50 dental practice patients examined patients' perceptions of the risk of acquiring BBVs and vCJD following dental treatment. Major concerns of patients revolved around hand hygiene practices rather than risks from BBVs or vCJD. No patient had avoided or delayed a visit to the dentist because of concerns over risks of cross infection.
