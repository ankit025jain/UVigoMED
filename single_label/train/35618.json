{"id":35618,"title":"Unilateral coronal craniosynostosis and Down syndrome.","abstract":"There is no known correlation between Down syndrome and craniosynostosis. The authors report 2 infants with trisomy 21 and right unilateral coronal craniosynostosis. Both patients were clinically asymptomatic but displayed characteristic craniofacial features associated with each disorder. One patient underwent a bilateral fronto-orbital advancement and the other underwent an endoscopically assisted strip craniectomy with postoperative helmet therapy. Both patients demonstrated good cosmesis at follow-up.
