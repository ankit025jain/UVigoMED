{"id":44565,"title":"Peg-interferon plus ribavirin with or without boceprevir or telaprevir for HCV genotype 1: a meta-analysis on the role of response predictors.","abstract":"To compare the efficacy of pegylated-interferon (Peg-IFN) ?-2a or ?-2b and ribavirin given as dual therapy versus triple therapy (Peg-IFN and ribavirin plus boceprevir or telaprevir) in patients with HCV-1 chronic hepatitis naïve for anti-HCV therapy or relapsers to dual therapy in relation to the presence of constitutional, clinical and virological predictors of treatment response.Included in the meta-analysis were studies meeting these criteria: original data from randomized trials on the efficacy of dual versus triple therapy in therapy-naïve patients or relapsers; at least one primary outcome clearly defined: sustained virological response in patients with or without rapid virological response (RVR), with genotype 1a or 1b, low or high HCV load, IL28-B CC or non-CC genotype, mild or severe fibrosis; odds ratio estimates of relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals; English language; and published up to the end of June 2013.Seven original studies met the inclusion criteria, allowing a meta-analysis on 3,652 patients. Triple therapy was more effective than dual, regardless of IL-28B genotype, HCV sub-genotype, liver fibrosis, and baseline HCV load. In 1,045 patients who achieved RVR, SVR was more frequently achieved with dual therapy (RR = 1.11; p = 0.002) than triple. The same results were achieved when only the therapy-naïve patients were considered.Triple therapy provides a significantly higher SVR rate than dual therapy, but dual therapy obtains a significantly higher SVR rate in patients with RVR. The data stress the clinical importance of a 4-week lead-in phase in direct-acting antiviral-based treatment.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728219","annotations":[{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.774293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.73884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.548361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.499434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.449497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.434852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.374453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.254677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.134399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Nave","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave"},{"name":"Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)"},{"name":"Boceprevir","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boceprevir"},{"name":"Telaprevir","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telaprevir"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.0172936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"United States Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution"},{"name":"652","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/652"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Triple (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"Interleukin 28","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_28"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Somnambulist (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnambulist_(Angel)"}]}
