{"id":81096,"title":"Occurrence of Hysterothylacium and Anisakis nematodes (Ascaridida: Ascaridoidea) in the tanaka's snailfish Liparis tanakae (Gilbert & Burke) (Scorpaeniformes: Liparidae).","abstract":"The tanaka's snailfish Liparis tanakae (Gilbert & Burke) (Scorpaeniformes: Liparidae) is an economically important marine fish species in China. However, the helminth parasites of this fish are still poorly known. During a helminthological survey of Chinese marine fishes from 2011 to 2012, we revealed that L. tanakae was heavily infected with third-stage larvae and adults of ascaridoid nematodes (total prevalence 100% and mean intensity 82.3 nematodes per fish). Four species of third-stage larvae Hysterothylacium liparis Li, Xu & Zhang, 2007, H. aduncum (Rudolphi, 1802), Hysterothylacium fabri (Rudolphi, 1819), and Anisakis pegreffii (Campana-Rouget & Biocca, 1955) and a single species of adults H. liparis were differentiated and identified by morphological and molecular methods. The detailed morphology of the four species of third-stage larvae was also studied using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The morphological and molecular characterization of the third-stage larvae of H. liparis was reported. Liparis tanakae represents a new host record for A. pegreffii and H. fabri. In addition, a new name, Hysterothylacium zhoushanense nom. nov. was also given to Hysterothylacium zhoushanensis Li, Liu & Zhang, 2012 to make the latinized specific epithet agree with this neuter generic name.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464274","annotations":[{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.882757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Parasitic worm","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.733822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.69961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.645747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.641477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.482562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Specific name (zoology)","weight":0.444512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_name_(zoology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.383456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Latinisation (literature)","weight":0.354731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinisation_(literature)"},{"name":"Ascaridida","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaridida"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.322916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Marine (ocean)","weight":0.296149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_(ocean)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.266363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Light microscopy","weight":0.253264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_microscopy"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.21466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Name of a biological genus","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_a_biological_genus"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Scorpaeniformes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpaeniformes"},{"name":"Anisakis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisakis"},{"name":"Helminthology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helminthology"},{"name":"Epithet","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithet"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Grammatical gender","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Karl Rudolphi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Rudolphi"},{"name":"Four Species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Species"},{"name":"Charles Henry Gilbert","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Henry_Gilbert"},{"name":"Lithium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"}]}
