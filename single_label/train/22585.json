{"id":22585,"title":"Synthesis, docking and evaluation of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of novel 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-6-yl)selenopheno[2,3-d]pyrimidines.","abstract":"A series of 1,2,4-(triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-6-yl)selenopheno[2,3-d]pyrimidines (10a-j) were synthesized with various substituted anilines and benzoic acids. Structures of newly synthesized compounds were established by IR, (1)H &(13)C NMR and LC-MS spectral data. The antioxidant activity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated by DPPH, NO and H2O2 radical scavenging methods. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Gram +ve and Gram -ve bacteria and antifungal activity by well diffusion method. Compounds 10d, 10h and 10i showed promising antioxidant, antibacterial as well as antifungal activity and these were found to be the most potent activity molecules when compared with that of standard drugs. Molecules docking studies have been performed on Staphylococcus aureus (SA) of Gram +ve bacteria.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531232","annotations":[{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.894133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Benzoic acid","weight":0.809271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzoic_acid"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.798509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.782914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Nuclear magnetic resonance","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.652211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.648721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Substitution reaction","weight":0.45067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_reaction"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.407213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.392511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.346946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.269337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Properties of water","weight":0.258384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"},{"name":"Aniline","weight":0.185593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniline"},{"name":"DPPH","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPPH"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0886352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Carbon-13","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-13"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Scavenger","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger"},{"name":"Hydrogen atom","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Molecular cloud","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_chromatography-mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
