{"id":68740,"title":"Impact of prednisone on toxicities and survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.","abstract":"We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing regimens that included daily oral prednisone (P) in only one arm to investigate its impact on toxicities and outcomes in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Five trials were identified totaling 2939 patients, of whom 1471 were randomized to an arm not containing P and 1468 received therapy containing P. There was no difference between the non-P and P groups for severe toxicities (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.82, p=0.712, I(2)=97.9%). When examining toxicities as a reason for discontinuing therapy, the non-P groups were not different from the P groups (relative risk [RR]=1.24, p=0.413, I(2)=86.8%). The non-P groups demonstrated no difference in OS compared to the P groups (HR=1.09, p=0.531, I(2)=79.7%). The meta-analysis is limited by the trial level design and small number of trials.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24500033","annotations":[{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.786648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.696404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.523759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.51883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"286","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/286"},{"name":"531","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/531"},{"name":"1471","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1471"},{"name":"712","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/712"},{"name":"1468","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1468"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Level design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_design"},{"name":"Trial court","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Croatian Radiotelevision","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Radiotelevision"},{"name":"Graphic design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design"},{"name":"Hero (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(Angel)"}]}
