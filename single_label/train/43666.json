{"id":43666,"title":"Dose-reduced CT with model-based iterative reconstruction in evaluations of hepatic steatosis: how low can we go?","abstract":"To determine whether dose-reduced CT with model-based iterative image reconstruction (MBIR) is a useful tool with which to diagnose hepatic steatosis.This prospective clinical study approved by our Institutional Review Board included 103 (67 men and 36 women; mean age, 64.3 years) patients who provided written informed consent to undergo unenhanced CT. Images of reference-dose CT (RDCT) with filtered back projection (R-FBP) and low- and ultralow-dose CT (dose-length product; 24 and 9% of that of RDCT) with MBIR (L-MBIR and UL-MBIR) were reconstructed. Mean CT numbers of liver (CT[L]) and spleen (CT[S]), and quotient (CT[L/S]) of CT[L] and CT[S] were calculated from selected regions of interest. Bias and limits of agreement (LOA) of CT[L] and CT[L/S] in L-MBIR and UL-MBIR (vs. R-FBP) were assessed using Bland-Altman analyses. Diagnostic methods for hepatic steatosis of CT[L]<48 Hounsfield units (HU) and CT[L/S]<1.1 were applied to L-MBIR and UL-MBIR using R-FBP as the reference standard.Bias was larger for CT[L] in UL-MBIR than in L-MBIR (-3.18HU vs. -1.73HU). The LOA of CT[L/S] was larger for UL-MBIR than for L-MBIR (±0.425 vs. ±0.245) and outliers were identified in CT[L/S] of UL-MBIR. Accuracy (0.92-0.95) and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (0.976-0.992) were high for each method, but some were slightly lower in UL-MBIR than L-MBIR.Dose-reduced CT reconstructed with MBIR is applicable to diagnose hepatic steatosis, however, a low dose of radiation might be preferable.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Digestive System
