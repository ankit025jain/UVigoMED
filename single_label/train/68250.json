{"id":68250,"title":"Dyslipidemia and progression of kidney disease: role of lipid-lowering drugs.","abstract":"HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity in patients with normal and abnormal kidney function but not in patients with end-stage kidney disease. Evidence supports a role for statins in delaying the progression of kidney disease in a variety of experimental models in animals. However, the evidence that statins may retard CKD progression in humans is scant. In this review, we critically consider the available data supporting a role for statins in CKD progression in humans and the possibility that there might be differences among statins in regards to effects on the kidneys. Finally, we review the evidence that statins may increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
