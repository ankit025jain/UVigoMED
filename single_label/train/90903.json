{"id":90903,"title":"What is the best clothing to prevent heat and cold stress? Experiences with thermal manikin.","abstract":"The present study summarizes the current knowledge of the heat and cold stress which might significantly affect military activities and might also occur among travellers who are not well adapted to weather variations during their journey. The selection of the best clothing is a very important factor in preserving thermal comfort. Our experiences with thermal manikin are also represented in this paper.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564064","annotations":[{"name":"Heat","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Weather","weight":0.650147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.402019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Thermal comfort","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_comfort"},{"name":"Clothing","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Manikin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manikin"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Thermal","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal"},{"name":"Variation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_(music)"},{"name":"Thermoreceptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoreceptor"},{"name":"Cold","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Experience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience"}]}
