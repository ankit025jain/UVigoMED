{"id":14142,"title":"An in vivo model for analysis of developmental erythropoiesis and globin gene regulation.","abstract":"Expression of fetal ?-globin in adulthood ameliorates symptoms of ?-hemoglobinopathies by compensating for the mutant ?-globin. Reactivation of the silenced ?-globin gene is therefore of substantial clinical interest. To study the regulation of ?-globin expression, we created the GG mice, which carry an intact 183-kb human ?-globin locus modified to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) from the G?-globin promoter. GG embryos express eGFP first in the yolk sac blood islands and then in the aorta-gonad mesonephros and the fetal liver, the sites of normal embryonic hematopoiesis. eGFP expression in erythroid cells peaks at E9.5 and then is rapidly silenced (>95%) and maintained at low levels into adulthood, demonstrating appropriate developmental regulation of the human ?-globin locus. In vitro knockdown of the epigenetic regulator DNA methyltransferase-1 in GG primary erythroid cells increases the proportion of eGFP(+) cells in culture from 41.9 to 74.1%. Furthermore, eGFP fluorescence is induced >3-fold after treatment of erythroid precursors with epigenetic drugs known to induce ?-globin expression, demonstrating the suitability of the G?-globin eGFP reporter for evaluation of ?-globin inducers. The GG mouse model is therefore a valuable model system for genetic and pharmacologic studies of the regulation of the ?-globin locus and for discovery of novel therapies for the ?-hemoglobinopathies.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24443374","annotations":[{"name":"Base
