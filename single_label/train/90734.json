{"id":90734,"title":"Repeal of the Michigan helmet law: early clinical impacts.","abstract":"Michigan repealed a 35-year mandatory helmet law on April 13, 2012. We examined the early clinical impacts at a level 1 trauma center in West Michigan.Retrospective cohort study comparing outcomes among motorcycle crash victims in a 7-month period before and after the helmet law repeal.One hundred ninety-two patients were included. After the repeal, nonhelmeted motorcyclists rose from 7% to 29% (P < .01). There was no difference in mortality rate after admission; however, crash scene fatalities increased significantly. Intensive care unit length of stay, mechanical ventilation time, and cost of stay were also higher in the nonhelmeted cohort (P < .05).Our study highlights the negative ramifications of repealing a mandatory helmet law. Motorcyclists not wearing helmets increased significantly in a short period of time. Nonhelmeted motorcyclists more frequently died on the scene, spent more time in the intensive care unit, required longer ventilator support, and had higher medical costs.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581760","annotations":[{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.619129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.51531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Motorcycle","weight":0.352478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.351701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Medical ventilator","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ventilator"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.113788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Michigan","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0481093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.0229663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"April 13","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_13"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Helmet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet"},{"name":"Unit vector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Repeal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeal"},{"name":"Health care prices","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_prices"},{"name":"West Michigan","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Michigan"}]}
