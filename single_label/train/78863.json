{"id":78863,"title":"[Quality of universal newborn hearing screening results : Multicenter analysis of data recorded between 2009 and 2012 in four German states].","abstract":"Bearing in mind the impending evaluation of newborn hearing screening in Germany, this study investigated whether multicenter analysis of the screening results from four German states is possible and to what extent the results meet national quality and outcome criteria.The screening data from 170 hospitals and a total of 533,150 newborns (21 % of all German newborns) from 2009 to 2012 were evaluated according to definite rules and analyzed in terms of averages, as well as over time.During the investigated period and averaged over the hospitals, the quality criteria \"percentage of screened newborns\" (91.4 %) and \"percentage requiring further follow-up\" (5.0 %), the \"day of screening\" (day 4), as well as the target parameter \"age at diagnosis\" (4.8 months) were not met. Steady improvements were observed over time: in the last year of the evaluation, 95.3 % of children were examined; only 4.8 % required follow-up and the age at diagnosis decreased to 4.2 months. On average, 83 % of the babies were screened before day 4. The steady reduction in variance of most of the variables from the participating hospitals indicates continual improvement.A multicenter analysis of screening data is possible and valid in the case of good quality data.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24557064","annotations":[{"name":"Infant","weight":0.475509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.288387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.209485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mendelian inheritance","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.122221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Universality (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universality_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Continuous improvement process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_improvement_process"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
