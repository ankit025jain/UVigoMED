{"id":23298,"title":"Application of RLEP real-time PCR for detection of M. leprae DNA in paraffin-embedded skin biopsy specimens for diagnosis of paucibacillary leprosy.","abstract":"The TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was evaluated systematically with respect to the standard curve, linear range, and used for detecting Mycobacterium leprae DNA in paraffin-embedded skin biopsy specimens from 60 confirmed leprosy patients and three healthy individuals and 29 other dermatoses and bacterial DNA from 21 different species. The test was further evaluated with 51 paucibacillary (PB) patients. The results showed that the test had good sensitivity (8 fg) and good specificity with no cross-reactivity with 21 other bacterial species and the control specimens, except one with Xanthomatosis. The real-time PCR detection rate for the 51 PB specimens was 74.5% (38 of 51). We conclude that the real-time PCR test is a useful adjunct test for diagnosing early stage or PB leprosy cases.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24493677","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.746321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Mycobacterium leprae","weight":0.692368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_leprae"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.676719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Skin biopsy","weight":0.522725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_biopsy"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.389445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Xanthoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthoma"},{"name":"Standard curve","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_curve"},{"name":"TaqMan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaqMan"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"RNA polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Petabyte","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petabyte"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Fg (Unix)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fg_(Unix)"}]}
