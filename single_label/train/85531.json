{"id":85531,"title":"[Simultaneous bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax; report of a case].","abstract":"Simultaneous bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax (SBSP) occurred in a 16-year-old male. He presented with severe dyspnea. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pneumothorax. Computed tomography revealed bilateral apical bullas. Chest tubes were promptly inserted bilaterally. The patient underwent single-stage bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery( VATS). Bilateral bullectomy was performed sequentially. Saline poured in to test for air leakage did not escape to the opposite pleural cavity, suggesting no pleuro-pleural communication. Post-operative course was uneventful. A bilateral single-stage VATS by a conventional lateral approach with intra-operative patient repositioning is a safe, feasible and familiar technique for treatment of SBSP.
