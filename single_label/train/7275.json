{"id":7275,"title":"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 knockout reduces cognitive impairment and pathogenesis in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","abstract":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology occurs in part as the result of excessive production of ?-amyloid (A?). Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is now considered a receptor for A? and consequently contributes to pathogenic A? signaling in AD.Genetic deletion of mGluR5 rescues the spatial learning deficits observed in APPswe/PS1?E9 AD mice. Moreover, both A? oligomer formation and A? plaque number are reduced in APPswe/PS1?E9 mice lacking mGluR5 expression. In addition to the observed increase in A? oligomers and plaques in APPswe/PS1?E9 mice, we found that both mTOR phosphorylation and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression were increased in these mice. Genetic deletion of mGluR5 reduced A? oligomers, plaques, mTOR phosphorylation and FMRP expression in APPswe/PS1?E9 mice.Thus, we propose that A? activation of mGluR5 appears to initiate a positive feedback loop resulting in increased A? formation and AD pathology in APPswe/PS1?E9 mice via mechanism that is regulated by FMRP.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Animal
