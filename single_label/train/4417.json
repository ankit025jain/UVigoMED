{"id":4417,"title":"[The epidemiology of demodex mites at the college students living in dormitories in the city of Ordu].","abstract":"Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis can cause different skin and eye symptoms. There are indications showing that the prevalence of these parasites is higher in public places. In this direction, the study was aimed to determine the prevalence of demodex in university students, inhabiting in dormitories.The study consisted of 300 men and women, college students who were staying in the dormitories in the city of Ordu. Random sampling method was used in the sample selection. Each participating student had to sign a patient's consent form, before samples were taken using standard superficial skin biopsies from the faces of the patients. The samples were embedded in Entellan mounting solution and examined under the light microscope.Samples were taken from 300 college students (170 males and 130 females) aged between 18-30 years, and in 110 (37%) of them, demodex mites were found. No significant differences were found between gender, age, type of skin or skin care, and Demodex incidence.Demodex mites are very prevalent in college students studying in Ordu.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308453","annotations":[{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.757491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.663352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Optical microscope","weight":0.660937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_microscope"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.267891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.19349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Skin biopsy","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_biopsy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"University","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Demodex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demodex"},{"name":"Ordu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordu"},{"name":"Demodex folliculorum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demodex_folliculorum"},{"name":"College","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Mite","weight":0.0253721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"1830","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1830"},{"name":"Face (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(geometry)"},{"name":"Public space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_space"},{"name":"Dormitory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormitory"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Random sampling","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sampling"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"}]}
