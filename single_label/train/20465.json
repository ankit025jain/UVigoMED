{"id":20465,"title":"Penicillium marneffei infection within an osteolytic lesion in an HIV-negative patient.","abstract":"Penicillium marneffei is a thermally dimorphic pathogenic fungus that causes systemic infection similar to disseminated cryptococcosis. P. marneffei is endemic in Southeast Asia, usually infecting HIV-infected individuals; infection of HIV-negative individuals is extremely rare. Here, we describe a disseminated P. marneffei infection within an osteolytic lesion in an HIV-negative patient. A 40-year-old Chinese woman presented with intermittent fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, and a skin rash. Following a sternum biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with P. marneffei infection. An emission computed tomography bone scan revealed the presence of increased radioactivity in the left clavicle and sternum, indicative of an osteolytic lesion. In addition to reporting this very rare case, we also present a brief review of the literature, highlighting the differences in clinical manifestations between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients infected with P. marneffei as it applies to our case.
