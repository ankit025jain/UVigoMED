{"id":52834,"title":"Effects of long-term thyroid hormone level alterations, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation and statin administration in rats.","abstract":"Thyroid hormones (THs) play multiple roles in the organism and alterations of their levels can result in many pathological changes. Currently, we use hyperthyroid and hypothyroid rats as \"models of a diseased organism\" and analyze whether n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) administration can ameliorate TH-induced pathophysiological changes. We investigate myosin heavy chain composition, calsequestrin levels, changes in cardiac tissue remodeling and cell-to-cell communication, expression of protein kinases, mitochondrial functions, oxidative stress markers and cell death, changes in serum lipid levels, activities of key enzymes of thyroid hormone metabolism, activity of acetylcholine esterase and membrane anisotropy, as well as mobile behavior and thermal sensitivity. Additionally we also mention our pilot experiments dealing with the effect of statin administration on skeletal muscles and sensory functions. As THs and n-3 PUFA possess multiple sites of potential action, we hope that our complex research will contribute to a better understanding of their actions, which can be useful in the treatment of different pathophysiological events including cardiac insufficiency in humans.
