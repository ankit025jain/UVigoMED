{"id":81529,"title":"[Electromyographic study of mastication muscles in patients with TMG osteoarthrosis].","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the functional activity of cranio-mandibular system in patients with TMG osteoarthrosis. The study included 20 patients with TMG osteoarthrosis and 20 healthy subjects representing control group. The EMG examination was performed according to standard protocol developed in Milan University. The symmetry index values in the group with TMG osteoarthrosis were lower than in the control group (78.76±12.29%), while Torque values were higher (8.53±14.62%). EMG standardized indexes allowed differentiating TMG osteoarthrosis.
