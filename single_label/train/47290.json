{"id":47290,"title":"Metalloproteinase-3 and -9 as novel markers in the evaluation of ulcerative colitis activity in children.","abstract":"The enhanced activity of matrix endopeptidases (MMPs) involved in the degradation of connective tissue has been noted in tissue samples from the digestive tract in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however sera concentrations of MMPs, a potential tool for diagnostic tests in IBD patients, have not been established so far. The goal of the studies was to evaluate the concentrations of MMP-3 and MMP-9, in the sera of children suffering from ulcerative colitis (UC) in relation to disease activity.The study was comprised of 31 children with UC (aged 3-18 years) and 37 children in the control group (aged 1-18 years). Disease activity was estimated using the Truelove-Witts scale. MMP-3 and -9 concentrations were determined using ELISA tests.Median MMP-3 concentrations were 18.4 ng/mL (95% CI: 12.5-24.3) for moderate and severe, 4.35 ng/mL (95% CI: 2.5-7.8) for the mild form of UC and 1.8 ng/mL (95% CI: 1.2-2.5) for the control group. Median MMP-9 concentrations were 18.0 ng/mL (95% CI: 2.83-36.6) for moderate and severe, 1.55 ng/mL (95% CI: 0.4-3.0) for the mild form of UC and 1.3 ng/mL (95% CI: 0.7-1.96) for the control group. Serum MMP-3 and MMP-9 concentrations in the moderate group were higher than those in the mild and control groups (p < 0.001). MMP-3 concentrations in the mild group also differed from those in the control group (p < 0.001). Among the parameters studied (MMP-3, MMP-9, CRP and ESR), MMP-3 had the highest discriminative value (AUC = 0.9, p < 0.001, sensitivity = 71%, specificity = 92%) in distinguishing patients with UC from healthy individuals.Elevation of MMP-3 and MMP-9 concentrations along with the disease activity suggests the possibility of their application in the evaluation of the clinical activity of UC.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24596011","annotations":[{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.780391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.725525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.672072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.670819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.458512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.441872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.431296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.160732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.129335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Endopeptidase","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endopeptidase"}]}
