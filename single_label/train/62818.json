{"id":62818,"title":"[Pulmonary malt lymphoma].","abstract":"This review will describe the current knowledge in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of pulmonary MALT (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue) lymphoma. Pulmonary MALT lymphomas are low-grade B cell lymphoma and are the most frequent lymphomas arising from the lung. Tumour cells arise from mucosa associated lymphoid tissue. Unlike other sites, no pathogen has been associated with pulmonary location of MALT lymphoma. However addictive translocations involving the MALT1 gene are frequently evidenced Patients are frequently asymptomatic and present with a chronic alveolar opacity. Diagnosis requires histology that may be retrieved by minimally invasive procedures during bronchial endoscopy or by CT scan guided percutaneous biopsies. Prognosis is good and treatment may vary with abstention, surgery, radiotherapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509230","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"MALT lymphoma","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MALT_lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.778848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.743415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.724201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Lymphoid tissue","weight":0.606359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_tissue"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue","weight":0.0199414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucosa-associated_lymphoid_tissue"},{"name":"B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"}]}
