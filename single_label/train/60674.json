{"id":60674,"title":"Hairy cell leukemia accompanied by Evans syndrome.","abstract":"We report a case of Western type hairy cell leukemia (HCL), a very rare leukemia in Japan. In this malignancy, leukemic cells in a peripheral blood film may be missed due in part to accompanying pancytopenia and in part to loss of typical cytoplasmic projections if prepared in a conventional Japanese way using forced air-drying. Our present patient also had a variety of autoantibodies and the clinical picture was primarily that of Evans syndrome (ES), suggesting disturbed immune responses associated with the HCL. Although HCL accompanied by either AIHA or ITP has been reported, the occurrence of ES in HCL is extremely rare.
