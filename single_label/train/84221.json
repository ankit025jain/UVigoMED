{"id":84221,"title":"[Clinical effects of packed red blood cells transfusion according to storage life and time of transfusion].","abstract":"It was studied 66 males aged 39.5Â±5.3 years with hemorrhagic shock II degree. Gas composition of arterial and venous blood was studied twice (before and after transfusion). It was revealed that succinct transfusion of packed red blood cells (to 2 doses) with storage life to 3 days after bleeding stop and hypovolemia filling is the most effective correction of hemorrhagic shock II degree. Replacement therapy in operating room in condition of stopped bleeding and unrepaired hypovolemia is burdening factor because it does not conducive to transfer of oxygen at the tissue level and inhibits stimulation of bone marrow in response to hypoxia.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25146544","annotations":[{"name":"Hypovolemia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovolemia"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.780056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.742257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.688377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.495769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.404307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Packed red blood cells","weight":0.311024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packed_red_blood_cells"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.271522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"}]}
