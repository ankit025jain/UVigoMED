{"id":38640,"title":"Assessment protocols of maximum oxygen consumption in young people with Down syndrome--a review.","abstract":"Maximum oxygen consumption is considered the gold standard measure of cardiorespiratory fitness. Young people with Down syndrome (DS) present low values of this indicator compared to their peers without disabilities and to young people with an intellectual disability but without DS. The use of reliable and valid assessment methods provides more reliable results for the diagnosis of cardiorespiratory fitness and the response of this variable to exercise. The aim of the present study was to review the literature on the assessment protocols used to measure maximum oxygen consumption in children and adolescents with Down syndrome giving emphasis to the protocols used, the validation process and their feasibility. The search was carried out in eight electronic databases--Scopus, Medline-Pubmed, Web of science, SportDiscus, Cinhal, Academic Search Premier, Scielo, and Lilacs. The inclusion criteria were: (a) articles which assessed VO2peak and/or VO2max (independent of the validation method), (b) samples composed of children and/or adolescents with Down syndrome, (c) participants of up to 20 years old, and (d) studies performed after 1990. Fifteen studies were selected and, of these, 11 measured the VO2peak using tests performed in a laboratory, 2 used field tests and the remaining 2 used both laboratory and field tests. The majority of the selected studies used maximal tests and conducted familiarization sessions. All the studies took into account the clinical conditions that could hamper testing or endanger the individuals. However, a large number of studies used tests which had not been specifically validated for the evaluated population. Finally, the search emphasized the small number of studies which use field tests to evaluate oxygen consumption.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
