{"id":83187,"title":"Management of salivary gland malignancies in the pediatric population.","abstract":"The management of pediatric salivary gland cancer (SGC) remains a challenge, and long-term outcome data are lacking for these rare tumors. The heterogeneity of histopathological features in 24 different SGCs further complicates unequivocal treatment recommendations across different age groups. This review aims to outline the management guidelines for pediatric SGC.Compared with adults, pediatric SGC is more often localized to the primary site and of low-grade histology. Surgery remains the treatment of choice accompanied by oncological treatment in selected patients. Elective neck dissection seems unnecessary as the occurrence of occult metastases is rare.This review provides information for clinicians to manage pediatric SGC highlighting the need for individually based treatment decisions at multidisciplinary head and neck centers.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24419404","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.564129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.549488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Neck dissection","weight":0.547339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_dissection"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.438889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.31318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.307222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.273852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Salivary gland neoplasm","weight":0.194893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland_neoplasm"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.170908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Occult","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Stargate Command","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Command"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
