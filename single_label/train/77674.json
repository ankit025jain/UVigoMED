{"id":77674,"title":"The impact of shift duration on the efficacy and tolerability of armodafinil in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with shift work disorder.","abstract":"To examine the impact of night-shift duration (?9 hours or >9 hours) on efficacy and tolerability of armodafinil in patients with shift work disorder (SWD).This was a post hoc analysis of a 6 week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Shift workers with diagnosed SWD and late-in-shift sleepiness (between 4?am and 8?am, including the commute home) received armodafinil 150?mg or placebo before their night shift.Proportion of patients with at least minimal improvement in late-in-shift sleepiness, late-in-shift Clinical Global Impressions-Change (CGI-C) rating and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), as well as overall Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale and modified Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS-M), were assessed at baseline and final visit.Of the 383 patients enrolled, 279 (73%) worked shifts ?9 hours and 104 (27%) worked shifts >9 hours. A greater percentage of patients receiving armodafinil had at least minimal improvement in late-in-shift CGI-C (?9 hours: 78% vs 60%, P?=?0.0017; >9 hours: 77% vs 46%, P?=?0.0020) regardless of shift duration. Armodafinil patients also demonstrated significantly greater improvements in GAF score (?9 hours: 9.5 vs 5.4, P?<?0.0001; >9 hours: 9.6 vs 4.3, P?=?0.0019) and KSS score (?9 hours: -2.9 vs -1.9, P?=?0.0002; >9 hours: -2.8 vs -1.6, P?=?0.00 28). Improvement in SDS-M composite score was significantly greater for armodafinil patients working >9 hours (-6.8 vs -2.7, P?=?0.0086). Headache was the most frequent adverse event in all treatment groups.Patients receiving armodafinil had significantly greater improvements in late-in-shift clinical condition and in wakefulness and overall global functioning than did placebo-treated patients, regardless of shift duration. Prospectively designed, randomized clinical trials that include objective measures of sleepiness are needed to support these findings.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450538","annotations":[{"name":"Somnolence","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.736981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.495077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Armodafinil","weight":0.358333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armodafinil"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Wakefulness","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefulness"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Karolinska Institutet","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karolinska_Institutet"},{"name":"Post hoc ergo propter hoc","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Social Democratic Union of Macedonia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Union_of_Macedonia"},{"name":"Shift work","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_work"},{"name":"Global Assessment of Functioning","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Assessment_of_Functioning"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Dragunov sniper rifle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragunov_sniper_rifle"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Level of measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement"},{"name":"Nightshift","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightshift"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"4 AM (Our Lady Peace song)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_AM_(Our_Lady_Peace_song)"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
