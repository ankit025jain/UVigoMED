{"id":62392,"title":"Modified retroperitoneoscopic renal pedicle lymphatic disconnection for intractable chyluria.","abstract":"To describe a modified retroperitoneoscopic renal pedicle lymphatic disconnection (MRRPLD) and to compare the efficacy and safety of MRRPLD with traditional retroperitoneoscopic renal pedicle lymphatic disconnection (RRPLD).From September 2008 to July 2012, RRPLD and MRRPLD were performed respectively on 18 and 14 patients at our center. Comparison was conducted including operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative time of bed rest, hospital stay, postoperative urine chyle test, and complications. All operations were completed without conversion to open surgery. The mean operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative time of bed rest, and hospital stay from MRRPLD group were all decreased compared with data from RRPLD group. There was significant difference in operative time, postoperative time of bed rest, and hospital stay (P <.05). Complications occurred only in 1 patient receiving RRPLD. Chyluria disappeared in all patients after the operation. No recurrence was observed during the follow-up.MRRPLD has a good effect and safety for chyluria. It is a simpler, more minimally invasive, and more economic surgical therapy compared with traditional RRPLD.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582120","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.638002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.566711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bed rest","weight":0.314973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_rest"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Chyle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chyle"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Disconnection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disconnection"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Mexican general election, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_general_election,_2012"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"}]}
