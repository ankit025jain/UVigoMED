{"id":44463,"title":"Inhibitory effect of biosynthetic nanoscale peptide Melittin on hepatocellular carcinoma, driven by survivin promoter.","abstract":"Hepatic resection and orthotopic liver transplantation are the only potentially curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but are indicated only in a minority of patients. Biosynthetic nanoscale peptide Melittin (Mel) is postulated to disrupt microbial phospholipid membranes by formation of stable or transient pores. Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family, is transcriptionally upregulated in most malignant tissues but not in normal tissues. It has been reported that the survivin promoter activity is tumor-specific and makes it a good candidate for construction of gene therapy vectors. In the present study, a non-viral vector (pSURV-Mel), encoding Mel gene, was developed to evaluate its anti-tumor effect in HCC cell lines and in vivo in a mouse model of human HCC xenograft tumor. Our results showed that the survivin promoter is specifically activated in tumor cells, and the pSURV-Mel plasmid expressed Mel selectively in tumor cells and also induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, intratumoral Injection of pSURV-Mel significantly suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, pSURV-Mel induced cell death by an apoptosis-dependent pathway. All taken together, this study elucidates a relatively safe, highly effective and cancer specific gene therapy strategy for HCC. The mechanisms of non-viral vector-induced cell death which were revealed by this work will shed light on the construction of more powerful vectors for cancer therapy.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Digestive System
