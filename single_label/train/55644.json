{"id":55644,"title":"A case of central serous chorioretinopathy associated with use of deer antler spray supplement.","abstract":"This case report describes central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) in a healthy man associated with the use of deer antler spray, an athletic supplement purported to contain insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The CSC resolved after cessation of the supplement. Currently, there are no reports in the literature linking IGF-1 and CSC. We conclude that agents containing IGF-1, such as deer antler supplements, may be correlated with the development of CSC.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24840532","annotations":[{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.175786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Antler","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antler"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1"},{"name":"Central serous retinopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_serous_retinopathy"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"Pepper spray","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray"},{"name":"Dual diagnosis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_diagnosis"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Economic development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Deer","weight":0.0130527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer"}]}
