{"id":69591,"title":"Secondary oxalosis due to excess vitamin C intake: a cause of graft loss in a renal transplant recipient.","abstract":"Renal oxalate deposition can be seen with primary hyperoxaluria, malabsorptive states, ethylene glycol toxicity and, rarely, with excessive vitamin C ingestion. We report a case of secondary hyperoxaluria in which the diagnosis was not considered initially because there was no past history of urinary calculi and no evidence of nephrocalcinosis on plain X-ray of the abdomen and ultrasonography. The disease was detected and diagnosed only after kidney transplantation. Secondary oxalosis can cause graft loss or delayed graft function. Biopsy of the allograft should be carefully examined for oxalate deposits even in the absence of a family history. When oxalosis is diagnosed, intensifying hemodialysis (HD) to eliminate calcium oxalate can help in the recovery of renal function in some cases. Systematic vitamin C supplementation in HD patients should be avoided as it can be a cause of secondary oxalosis.
