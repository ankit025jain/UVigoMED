{"id":24250,"title":"[Microbial stress of skin and wounds in clinical aspects and practice. Between search and destroy and monitor and relax].","abstract":"The antibiotic treatment of microbial pathogens of the skin and wounds could so far not fulfil the expectations of an effective and permanent elimination of pathogens so that local treatment with antiseptic agents as a flanking measure to wound cleansing and debridement has become increasingly more established. Because an antiseptic treatment does not actually represent a treatment of infections, the current antimicrobial treatment strategy for infections in skin and wound areas consists of combined antibiotic and flanking antiseptic administration following debridement. However, the combined therapy is not always successful. There is an urgent need for new forms of therapy particularly to combat multiresistant pathogens in biofilms in infections of chronic and other complicated wounds.
