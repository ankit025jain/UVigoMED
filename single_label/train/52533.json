{"id":52533,"title":"Influence of experimental diabetes and insulin treatment on the enantioselective pharmacokinetics of mexiletine and its metabolites.","abstract":"This study evaluates the influence of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on the kinetic disposition and metabolism of mexiletine (MEX) enantiomers in rats. Animals in the control (n = 6 for each blood collection time), diabetic (single intravenous dosage of 45 mg·(kg body mass)(-1) of streptozotocin), and insulin-treated groups (diabetic rats treated daily with 2 IU insulin) received by gavage a single dose of 10 mg·(kg body mass)(-1) racemic MEX. MEX enantiomers and the metabolites hydroxymethylmexiletine (HMM) and p-hydroxymexiletine PHM) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Statistical analysis was based on a serial sacrifice design, and parameter estimation was performed using a Bayesian modeling procedure. Area under the curve (AUC) for the (-)-(R) enantiomers of MEX, HMM, and PHM did not differ between the control and diabetic groups. However, AUC for (+)-(S)-MEX and (+)-(S)-HMM were lower in the diabetic than in the control group. Insulin treatment recovered glucose levels to normal and the (+)-(S)-MEX AUC and (+)-(S)-HMM AUC became similar to the AUCs observed in the nondiabetic animals.
