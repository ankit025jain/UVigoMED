{"id":37578,"title":"Biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia and neonatal morbidity: a case-control study.","abstract":"To investigate the association of preeclampsia with angiogenic imbalance, and the correlation of levels of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors to complications in mother and fetus.Serum samples were obtained from 40 women with established preeclampsia (study group) and from 40 normotensive women (control group). Epidemiological characteristics of the two groups were analyzed. The levels of the angiogenic (VEGF and PlGF) and anti-angiogenic (sFlt-1) factors of the two study groups were determined in serum using ELISA. Neonatal adverse outcomes (late preterm, early term, low birth weight (LBW), very LBW (VLBW), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission) between the groups of the study were analyzed, as well as the association between the biomarkers of the study and neonatal adverse outcomes of the preeclamptic group of patients.sFlt-1 levels were significantly higher in the preeclamptic women compared to normotensive women (median (range): 21297 (690-32637)pg/ml vs. 846.45 (363-2867)pg/ml, respectively), whereas there was a significant decrease in the levels of VEGF (90 (90-211)pg/ml vs. 90.55 (90-521)pg/ml, respectively), as well as in the levels of PlGF (13.62 (8-532)pg/ml vs. 239.86 (61-685)pg/ml, respectively). The increased serum values of the anti-angiogenic sFlt-1 were associated with increased rates of late preterm and early term births and VLBW.An imbalance between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors exists in preeclampsia and is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485669","annotations":[{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Intrauterine growth restriction","weight":0.871618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_growth_restriction"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.799132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.758551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.696211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.672162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.640434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.521095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.308022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.174805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0540107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"}]}
