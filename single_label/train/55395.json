{"id":55395,"title":"Prediction of glaucomatous visual field progression: pointwise analysis.","abstract":"To evaluate whether pointwise regression analysis of serial measures of retinal sensitivity can predict future visual field (VF) loss.Medical records of 158 patients with glaucomatous eyes with at least 6 years follow-up and 10 reliable VF exams were retrospectively analyzed. The entire follow-up period was divided into two, roughly corresponding to the first (early period) and second (late period) half of follow-up. Retinal sensitivity data obtained from the Swedish interactive threshold algorithm standard or full-threshold VF tests were analyzed, and linear and first-order exponential regression analyses of retinal sensitivity against time were performed to obtain the slope of regression analysis in each VF test location. Paired t tests were used to compare the slopes of the early and late period in each regression analysis.When assessed by linear regression analysis, inferior nasal location showed highest rate of change (-0.52?dB/year) in early period. Late period showed generally faster rate of progression compared to early period. Superior arcuate and superior and inferior nasal locations showed that early and late slopes did not show significant difference (p value,?0.19???0.49). Central and edged locations showed significant difference between the two slopes (p value??<?0.05). First-order exponential regression analysis showed similar result.Superior arcuate and superior and inferior nasal areas in VF had a consistent rate of change of retinal sensitivity, indicating that these locations may have the higher capability for prediction of future deterioration. These results suggest that location should be considered when predicting glaucomatous VF progression.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24892993","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.607488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.113728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.0997798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Slope","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0489187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0401361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"P-value","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Central Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Subscript and superscript","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscript_and_superscript"},{"name":"Confidence band","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_band"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Late Period of ancient Egypt","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Period_of_ancient_Egypt"},{"name":"Exponential growth","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Interactivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactivity"}]}
