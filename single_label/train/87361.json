{"id":87361,"title":"Sentinel injuries: subtle findings of physical abuse.","abstract":"Injuries, other than abrasions, are rare in precruising infants. In this population, a history or observation of a sentinel skin injury, intraoral injury, or musculoskeletal injury without a plausible explanation, is concerning for physical abuse. A precruising infant with a sentinel injury should be medically evaluated for occult injury and predisposing medical conditions, as well as reported to authorities for further investigation. Early identification of sentinel injuries and appropriate interventions can prevent further abuse.
