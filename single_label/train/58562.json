{"id":58562,"title":"Lack of association between serotonin transporter 5-HTT gene polymorphism and endometriosis in an Italian patient population.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine whether the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), a key component in the control of the serotonergic system, is associated with endometriosis in an Italian population.A case-control study, comprising 137 Italian patients with surgically confirmed endometriosis and 120 healthy controls, was carried out. 5-HTT genotypes (LL, SL and SS) were obtained by polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis analysis. We found no overall difference in genotypic and allelic distributions of the 5-HTT gene between cases and controls.Our results suggest that the 5-HTT L/S promoter polymorphism is not associated with susceptibility to endometriosis in the studied Italian patients.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925205","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.658814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.642728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.6348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.597982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.579805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Serotonin transporter","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_transporter"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.272125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Italian people","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_people"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Schutzstaffel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Huntingtin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingtin"},{"name":"Fish measurement","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_measurement"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"}]}
