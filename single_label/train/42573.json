{"id":42573,"title":"Toward a personalized medicine approach to the management of inflammatory bowel disease.","abstract":"The medical management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is evolving toward a personalized medicine-based model. Modern therapeutic algorithms that feature use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists in combination with immunosuppressive are highly effective when initiated in high-risk patients early in the course of disease. Defined targets that guide intensification of therapy are critical interventions. In this model, therapy is optimized through appropriate pretreatment testing, therapeutic drug monitoring, and patient-based monitoring strategies. This review discusses the current application of personalized medicine to the management of IBD.
