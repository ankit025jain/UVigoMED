{"id":61025,"title":"Efficacy and safety of eculizumab in children and adolescents with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.","abstract":"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is rare in children, but represents a similarly serious and chronic condition as in adults. Children with PNH frequently experience complications of chronic hemolysis, recurrent thrombosis, marrow failure, serious infections, abdominal pain, chronic fatigue, and decreased quality of life with reduced survival. The terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab is proven to be effective and safe in adults and approved by the FDA for treatment of PNH.Eculizumab therapy resulted in complete and sustained inhibition of hemolysis in all participants with a reduction of lactate dehydrogenase to normal levels. All hematological parameters stabilized. No definitive, study drug-related adverse events were observed. Only one severe SAE of hospitalization due to aplastic anemia occurred, which was not study drug-related.Eculizumab appears to be a safe and effective therapy for children with PNH.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777716","annotations":[{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Aplastic anemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplastic_anemia"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.788203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.684374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.660458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Hemoglobinuria","weight":0.555557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobinuria"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.552466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria","weight":0.483969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_nocturnal_hemoglobinuria"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.483806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.244317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Paroxysmal attack","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_attack"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Eculizumab","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eculizumab"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"},{"name":"Aplasia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplasia"}]}
