{"id":47021,"title":"Transanal endoscopic microsurgery colorectal anastomosis: a critical step to natural orifice colorectal surgery in humans.","abstract":"Transanal endoscopic microsurgery is used in the surgical management of advanced rectal polyps and early rectal cancers. There are case reports of transanal endoscopic microsurgery colorectal anastomoses being performed with laparoscopic assistance in humans.The concept of a transanal endoscopic microsurgery colorectal anastomosis without laparoscopic assistance has been discussed and trialed on animal and cadaveric specimens; however, to date, there have been no technical reports of this particular procedure in the literature.We present a technical note describing a transanal endoscopic microsurgery intraperitoneal colorectal anastomosis in a live human without laparoscopic assistance.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608316","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.694342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.673437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.602154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.526676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.455739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.169585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
