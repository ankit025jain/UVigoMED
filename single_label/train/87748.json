{"id":87748,"title":"The injured runner.","abstract":"Running is often recommended by physicians to maintain a healthy lifestyle. As more individuals participate in running-related activities, clinicians must be increasingly aware of common injuries. Training errors leading to overuse are the most common underlying factors in most running-related injuries. Clinicians need to keep in mind that the presenting injury is frequently the result of an inability to compensate for a primary dysfunction at another site. Although imaging may be helpful in differentiating among diagnoses with similar clinical presentations, a detailed history and physical examination are essential in making a correct diagnosis.
