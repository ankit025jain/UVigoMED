{"id":79603,"title":"The role of toll-like receptor agonists in the immunotherapy of leishmaniosis. An update and proposal for a new form of anti-leishmanial therapy.","abstract":"The use of toll-like receptor agonists in immunotherapy is a new approach in the prevention of immunosuppression during fatal Leishmania parasite infection. The objective of such immunotherapy is to activate specific cell-mediated immune responses, macrophage activation and antigen-responsive inflammation, to kill intracellular amastigotes. Toll-like receptor agonist-based treatment in immunocompetent hosts can be effective either by selective use of the agonists alone or in combination with the anti-leishmanial drug stibanate. Recent investigations suggest that toll-like receptor signal pathways constitute a possible new mode of anti-leishmanial treatment. This article describes the prospect of toll-like receptor - mediated signal pathways in the immunotherapy of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniosis, as well as post kala-azar dermal leishmaniosis (PKADL), a skin-sequel of visceral infection. Suitable synthetic agonists need to be developed for toll-like receptors to overcome immunosuppression.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25115057","annotations":[{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Leishmania","weight":0.782502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.694783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.521606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.509917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.320833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Amastigote","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amastigote"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"}]}
