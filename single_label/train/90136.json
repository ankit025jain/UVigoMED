{"id":90136,"title":"Internal fixation compared with total hip replacement for displaced femoral neck fractures: a minimum fifteen-year follow-up study of a previously reported randomized trial.","abstract":"Prospective randomized studies comparing internal fixation and a cemented hip replacement in the treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures have shown favorable short-term results for prosthetic replacement. The present report compares the results after a minimum of fifteen years.From 1994 to 1998, 143 patients (146 hips) were randomized to closed reduction and internal fixation with two screws (n = 78) or a cemented total hip replacement (n = 68). The average age of the patients was eighty-four years (range, seventy-five to 101 years), and 38% were classified as mentally impaired. Failure after internal fixation was defined as early redisplacement, nonunion, symptomatic segmental collapse, or deep infection. In the arthroplasty group, failure was defined as two dislocations or more, implant loosening, deep infection, or a periprosthetic fracture.For the lucid patients, the failure rate was 55% after internal fixation compared with 5% after total hip replacement. For patients with mental impairment, it was 16% in both groups.Total hip replacement is superior to internal fixation in the treatment of a displaced femoral neck fracture.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647513","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.815177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.5527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.545403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.470812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.331201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.237111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Developmental disability","weight":0.0775986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0670588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Femur neck","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Failure (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_(band)"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Displacement (ship)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(ship)"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Cervical fracture","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_fracture"}]}
