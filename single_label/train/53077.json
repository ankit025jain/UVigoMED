{"id":53077,"title":"Direct inhibitory effects of pioglitazone on hepatic fetuin-A expression.","abstract":"Fetuin-A, a circulating glycoprotein synthesized in the liver, is involved in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, regulation of fetuin-A synthesis has remained obscure. We previously reported that pioglitazone treatment significantly reduced serum fetuin-A levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. To clarify whether pioglitazone can directory inhibit hepatic fetuin-A synthesis, we investigated the effects of pioglitazone on fetuin-A expression both in vitro and in vivo. Pioglitazone treatment suppressed mRNA and protein expression of fetuin-A in Fao hepatoma cells. Interestingly, rosiglitazone but not metformin, also inhibited fetuin-A expression. In addition, GW 9662, an inhibitor of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) ?, reversed pioglitazone-induced suppression of fetuin-A, suggesting that thiazolidinedione derivatives may have common characteristics with regard to fetuin-A suppression, possibly through PPAR?activation. Finally, oral administration of pioglitazone to mice for 8 weeks resulted in suppression of hepatic fetuin-A mRNA. These findings suggest that pioglitazone may partially ameliorate insulin resistance through its direct inhibitory effects on fetuin-A expression in the liver.
