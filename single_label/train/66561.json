{"id":66561,"title":"Detection of prostate calcification with megavoltage helical CT.","abstract":"Prostate calcification is a noninvasive landmark for daily positioning of image-guided radiation therapy. However, detectability of prostate calcification with megavoltage helical computed tomography (MVCT) has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the detectability of prostate calcification and to investigate how to predict detectability of calcification with MVCT.Thirty patients with prostate cancer who were scheduled for helical tomotherapy were included in this study. The detectability of prostate calcification on MVCT was evaluated by comparing against kilovoltage multidetector-row CT (KVCT) as the standard of reference. Maximum signal intensity (SImax), area (A) of calcification, and the product of both (SImax路A) were compared between undetectable and detectable calcifications. Then, the threshold values of SImax, A, and SImax路A were decided to achieve 100% sensitivity on MVCT.KVCT identified 49 calcifications in 28 of 30 patients. MVCT detected 19 (39%) of 49 calcifications in 15 (50%) of 30 patients. The minimum threshold values of SImax, A, and SImax路A to detect prostate calcifications were 953 HU, 20.98 mm(2), and 7784 HU mm(2), respectively. Using the threshold values of SImax, A, and SImax路A, 20% (10/49), 18% (9/49), and 35% (17/49) of calcifications were in the detection range, respectively.MVCT can depict about one-third of prostate calcifications detectable on KVCT. The product of maximum signal intensity and area of calcification is the most distinguishable index for predicting patients showing prostate calcifications on MVCT.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703468","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.56926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.465305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.30477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.288801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Helix","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix"},{"name":"Tomotherapy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomotherapy"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Hungary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"1749","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1749"},{"name":"1049","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1049"},{"name":"953","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/953"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Metastatic calcification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastatic_calcification"},{"name":"Range (particle radiation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(particle_radiation)"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Megavoltage X-rays","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megavoltage_X-rays"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Landmark","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark"}]}
