{"id":53853,"title":"[Amylin under examination. Fibrillogenic polypeptide hormone of the pancreas].","abstract":"In patients or animals affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) some pathological deposits, called amyloid, are observed among cells of islets of Langerhans. Among other constituents, deposits consist of an insoluble, fibrillar form of peptide neurohormone called amylin, produced by pancreatic beta cells. It is thought that formation of fibrillar deposits of misfolded and aggregated peptide is highly toxic to beta cells and leads to cell dysfunction, cell loss, pancreas destruction and progress of the disease. This relatively small 37-amino acid peptide constitutes a serious scientific, research and to some extent a medical problem. This article presents amylin as a hormone, neurohormone and as a fibrillating molecule which participates in amyloid deposit formation in human and animal pancreas. The role of some amino acids important for fibril formation has been highlighted.
