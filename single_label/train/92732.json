{"id":92732,"title":"PPAR?/? promotes HRAS-induced senescence and tumor suppression by potentiating p-ERK and repressing p-AKT signaling.","abstract":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-?/? (PPAR?/?) inhibits skin tumorigenesis through mechanisms that may be dependent on HRAS signaling. The present study examined the hypothesis that PPAR?/? promotes HRAS-induced senescence resulting in suppression of tumorigenesis. PPAR?/? expression increased p-ERK and decreased p-AKT activity. Increased p-ERK activity results from the dampened HRAS-induced negative feedback response mediated in part through transcriptional upregulation of RAS guanyl-releasing protein 1 (RASGRP1) by PPAR?/?. Decreased p-AKT activity results from repression of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDPK1) expression. Decreased p-AKT activity in turn promotes cellular senescence through upregulation of p53 and p27 expression. Both over-expression of RASGRP1 and shRNA-mediated knockdown of ILK partially restore cellular senescence in Ppar?/?-null cells. Higher PPAR?/? expression is also correlated with increased senescence observed in human benign neurofibromas and colon adenoma lesions in vivo. These results demonstrate that PPAR?/? promotes senescence to inhibit tumorigenesis and provide new mechanistic insights into HRAS-induced cellular senescence.
