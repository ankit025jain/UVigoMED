{"id":24064,"title":"Time to positivity in liquid culture predicts colony forming unit counts of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum specimens.","abstract":"Time to liquid culture positivity (TTP) is a technically accessible and widely available measure of viable mycobacterial load in sputum samples. We describe the ability of TTP to predict colony forming unit counts of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from sputum samples collected before or during the first 14 days of antituberculosis therapy.
