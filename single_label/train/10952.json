{"id":10952,"title":"Cocirculation of three hemagglutinin and two neuraminidase subtypes of avian influenza viruses in Huzhou, China, April 2013: implication for the origin of the novel H7N9 virus.","abstract":"We detected three avian influenza hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes (H7, H9, and H5) and two neuraminidase (NA) subtypes (N9 and N2), as well as H7N9-related H9N9 reassortant intermediates, cocirculating among poultry in Huzhou, China, during April 2013. The results of our study reveal not only that Huzhou is one of the geographic origins of the novel H7N9 virus but also that cocirculation poses a potential threat to humans in the future.
