{"id":47985,"title":"Guidance for the nutrition management of gastrointestinal allergy in pediatrics.","abstract":"Food allergies and their related elimination diets have been associated with an increased risk of inadequate nutrient intake and poor growth in the pediatric population. In recognition of these nutritional risks, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy in the United States recommend nutrition counseling and close growth monitoring for all children with food allergy. The care of children with gastrointestinal food allergic disorders can be complicated and is best performed with a structured approach in which medical and nutrition needs are addressed simultaneously. Children with gastrointestinal food allergy may be at greater nutritional risk because of decreased dietary intake. For these children, it is important to perform a comprehensive nutrition assessment to identify nutrition-related problems and to develop and implement a plan that meets the patient's needs within the context of the elimination diet. We provide an overview of the nutritional risks and strategies to assess nutritional status in pediatric patients with gastrointestinal food allergy.
