{"id":75566,"title":"[Cultural adaptation of the scale Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia - PAINAD to Brazil].","abstract":"To translate and culturally adapt to Brazil the scale Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia(PAINAD).The cultural adaptation process followed the methodology of a theorical reference, in five steps: translation to Brazilian Portuguese, consensual version of translations, back-translation to the original language, revision by a committee of specialists in the field and a equivalency pre-test. The instrument was assessed and applied by 27 health professionals in the last step.The Escala de Avaliação de Dor em Demência Avançada was culturally adapted to Brazil and presented semantic equivalency to the original, besides clarity, applicability and easy comprehension of the instrument items.This process secured the psychometric properties as the reliability and content validity of the referred scale.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076274","annotations":[{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.89825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Brazilian Portuguese","weight":0.7081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Portuguese"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.624062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Portugal","weight":0.504067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.451388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.422166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.406273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Semantics","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Committee","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Content validity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_validity"},{"name":"Semantic equivalence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_equivalence"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Tel Dor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Dor"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Escala (group)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escala_(group)"}]}
