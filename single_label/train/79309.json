{"id":79309,"title":"Improving sound localization after cochlear implantation and auditory training for the management of single-sided deafness.","abstract":"To report a successful case of cochlear implantation and auditory training for the improvement of sound localization in a patient with single-sided deafness.Case report and literature review.Tertiary referral otology practice.Fifty-seven-year-old man receiving cochlear implantation after 8 years of unilateral sensorineural hearing loss.Initially, CROS hearing aid, then osseointegrated bone conduction system and finally cochlear implantation and auditory training.Sound localization tests.Sound localization tests after CI and auditory training showed improvement when compared with testing performed after fitting of an osseointegrated bone conduction system.Cochlear implantation followed by 3 months of auditory training may have improved sound localization in this patient with single-sided deafness. Further case-controlled studies need to be undertaken to ascertain whether CI alone without formal auditory training will promote the same results.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448287","annotations":[{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Bone conduction","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_conduction"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.799146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.786795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Otology","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otology"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.633441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.612956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.382953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Sound localization","weight":0.316667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_localization"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Cochlear Limited","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_Limited"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Unilateral hearing loss","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateral_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Electrical conduction system of the heart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conduction_system_of_the_heart"},{"name":"Osseointegration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseointegration"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Cochlear nuclei","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nuclei"},{"name":"Language localisation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
