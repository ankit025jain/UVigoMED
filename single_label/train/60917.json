{"id":60917,"title":"Prevalence and correlates of maternal anemia in rural Sidama, Southern Ethiopia.","abstract":"In order to assess the prevalence and correlates of prenatal anemia, a survey was conducted among 700 randomly selected pregnant women in rural Sidama, Southern Ethiopia. The prevalences of anemia, Iron Deficiency (ID) and ID anemia were 31.6%, 17.4% and 8.7%, respectively. The burden of anemia was significantly high among illiterates, women devoid of self-income, lowlanders, multiparas and women aged 25-34 years. Women who weren't on iron-folate supplementation had 1.90 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.14-3.19) times increased odds of anemia. Anemia was associated with ID, zinc deficiency and elevated C-reactive protein with odds ratio of 2.46 (95% CI: 1.63-3.73), 2.29 (95% CI: 1.62-3.23) and 1.98 (95% CI: 1.12-3.47) respectively; however, it was not associated with vitamin A deficiency. Though ID was a significant correlate of anemia, only 11.8% of anemia was attributable to it. Zinc, iron and vitamin A deficiencies did not show synergistic interaction in associating with anemia.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796168","annotations":[{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.826331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.763082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Vitamin A","weight":0.70277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.587161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.460158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.379329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Ethiopia","weight":0.379295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Vitamin A deficiency","weight":0.148052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A_deficiency"},{"name":"Zinc deficiency","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_deficiency"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Literacy","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy"},{"name":"Sidama people","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidama_people"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Idaho","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho"},{"name":"623","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/623"},{"name":"633","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/633"},{"name":"1 decametre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decametre"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Scottish Lowlands","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Lowlands"},{"name":"Confidence (2003 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_(2003_film)"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Maternal death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death"}]}
