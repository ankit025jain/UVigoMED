{"id":78879,"title":"[Tree pollen dispersion in Ito City, Shizuoka Prefecture].","abstract":"The authors investigated the atmospheric tree pollen dispersion in Ito City, Shizuoka Prefecture for 12 years for the purpose of the prophylaxis and treatment of pollinosis.We set up a Durham sampler on the rooftop of the three-story building in Ito City, and counted atmospheric pollen grouping first, Taxodiaceae and Cupressaceae; second, Pinaceae and Podocarpaceae; third, Betulaceae and Ulmaceae; last, Fagaceae. The counts of atmospheric tree pollen on season and the weather from January to June were treated statistically and analyzed on the computer program Microsoft Excel.Each average and SD of total pollen count was, in order, 7079±6503 count/cm(2), 502±146 count/cm(2), 891±480 count/cm(2), 906±481 count/cm(2). The last summer weather correlates to the atmospheric pollen count of Taxodiaceae, Cupressaceae, Betulaceace and Ulmaceae. The atmospheric pollen count of Taxodiaceae and Cupressaceae in spring is influenced by the weather; their atmospheric pollen count is reduced by a heavy rain or a heavy snow out of season. The atmospheric pollen count of Pinaceae, Podocarpaceae and Fagaceae does not relate to the weather.As a result of having examined the relations between the count of the atmospheric pollen and the weather in Ito City, I recognized relations in Taxodiaceae, Cupressaceae, Pinaceae and Podocarpaceae, but there were not the relations of intentionality in Betulaceae, Ulmaceae and Fagaceae.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552763","annotations":[{"name":"Tree","weight":0.526802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Pollen","weight":0.322283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen"},{"name":"Computer program","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program"},{"name":"Snow","weight":0.135098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow"},{"name":"Pinaceae","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinaceae"},{"name":"Cupressaceae","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupressaceae"},{"name":"Podocarpaceae","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podocarpaceae"},{"name":"Fagaceae","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagaceae"},{"name":"Taxodiaceae","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxodiaceae"},{"name":"Rain","weight":0.0934898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Betulaceae","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betulaceae"},{"name":"Ulmaceae","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulmaceae"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Microsoft Excel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel"},{"name":"Shizuoka Prefecture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shizuoka_Prefecture"},{"name":"Intentionality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentionality"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Microsoft","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Weather","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather"},{"name":"Roof","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roof"},{"name":"Standard-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-definition_television"},{"name":"Lake-effect snow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake-effect_snow"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Spring (hydrosphere)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrosphere)"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Treatise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Sampler (musical instrument)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampler_(musical_instrument)"},{"name":"Pollen count","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen_count"},{"name":"Dispersion (optics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)"},{"name":"Railways Act 1921","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railways_Act_1921"},{"name":"Closed season","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_season"}]}
