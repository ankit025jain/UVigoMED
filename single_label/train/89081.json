{"id":89081,"title":"Neurological manifestations of thoracic myelopathy.","abstract":"Investigation of preoperative manifestations of thoracic myelopathy in a large population has not been reported. The aim of this study was to identify symptoms specific to anatomical pathology or compressed segments in thoracic myelopathy through investigation of preoperative manifestations.Subjects were 205 patients [143 men, 62 women; mean age, 62.2 (range 21-87 years)] with thoracic myelopathy who underwent surgery at our affiliate institutions from 2000 to 2011. The disease distribution included ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) in 106 patients, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) in 17, OLF with OPLL in 17, intervertebral disc herniation (IDH) in 23, OLF with IDH in 3, and spondylosis in 39. We assessed (1) initial and preoperative complaints, (2) neurological findings, (3) Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores (JOA, full score, 11 points), (4) the compressed segments, and (5) preoperative duration. Multivariate analyses were performed to examine potential relationships between preoperative manifestations and anatomical pathology or compressed segments.The multivariate analyses revealed relationships between lower limb muscle weakness and T10/11 anterior compression; lower limb pain and T11/12 anterior compression; low back pain and T11/12 compression; and hyporeflexia in the patellar tendon reflex/foot drop and T12/L1 anterior compression.This study elucidated symptoms specific to anatomical pathology or compressed segments in thoracic myelopathy. These relationships can be helpful in the initial investigation of thoracic diseases, although additional measures such as MRI or CT are necessary for definitive diagnosis.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756535","annotations":[{"name":"Thoracic
