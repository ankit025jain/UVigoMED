{"id":86308,"title":"Obstructive sleep apnea in obese community-dwelling children: the NANOS study.","abstract":"Obesity in children is assumed to serve as a major risk factor in pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). However, the prevalence of OSAS in otherwise healthy obese children from the community is unknown.To determine the prevalence of OSAS in obese children identified and recruited from primary care centers.A cross-sectional, prospective, multicenter study. Spanish children ages 3-14 y with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for age and sex were randomly selected, and underwent medical history, snoring, and Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) assessments, as well as physical examination, nasopharyngoscopy, and nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) recordings.Two hundred forty-eight children (54.4% males) with mean age of 10.8 ± 2.6 y were studied with a BMI of 28.0 ± 4.7 kg/m(2) corresponding to 96.8 ± 0.6 percentile when adjusted for age and sex. The mean respiratory disturbance index (RDI), obstructive RDI (ORDI), and obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) were 5.58 ± 9.90, 5.06 ± 9.57, and 3.39 ± 8.78/h total sleep time (TST), respectively. Using ? 3/h TST as the cutoff for the presence of OSAS, the prevalence of OSAS ranged from 21.5% to 39.5% depending on whether OAHI, ORDI, or RDI were used.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24790273","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.664568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.646788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.591498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.574425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.562853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.542531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.473334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.171439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.151262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.129987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Snoring","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoring"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Respiratory Disturbance Index","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_Disturbance_Index"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
