{"id":36044,"title":"[The protein oxidation and antioxidant defence mechanisms in children with atopic dermatitis].","abstract":"120 children 1-18 years old with atopic dermatitis (AD) were examined. Thus in 60 children AD was on the background of undifferentiated connective tissue dysplasia. 60 children were examined without this pathology Condition of antioxidant system we have studied levels of protein oxidation due to condition of antioxidant system we have studied levels of enzymes (superoxiddysmutase, glutathione reduktase, glutathione peroxidase). Analisis of results revealed dysbalance in prooxidant system in all groups of children under supervision. Decreasing levels of certain fractions of proteins the length of waves 356 n. m., 370 n. m. and increasing certain fractions of proteins the length of waves 530 n. m. with progressive worsening due to severity of AD. We improved high activity of antioxidant defence mechanisms in children with AD in comparison to healthy ones. Levels of enzymes were changed depending on severity of AD. In case milder course of the disease activation of protein oxidation with further exhausting took place. Presence of undifferentiated dysplasia of connective tissue in children with AD didn't make any differences in results of studies.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605640","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.823523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.625776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.613398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.612708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.60408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Pro-oxidant","weight":0.30435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-oxidant"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.285883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.234564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.230397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.147756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Glutathione peroxidase","weight":0.140403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"356","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/356"},{"name":"370","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/370"},{"name":"Defence mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanism"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Area code 530","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_530"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.0126805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"}]}
