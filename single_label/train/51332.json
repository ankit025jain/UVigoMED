{"id":51332,"title":"Glargine metabolism over 24 h following its subcutaneous injection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a dose-response study.","abstract":"After subcutaneous injection insulin glargine is rapidly metabolized to M1 and M2. In vitro, both M1 and M2 have metabolic effects and bind to IGF-1R similarly to human insulin, whereas glargine exhibits a higher affinity for the IGF-1R and greater mitogenetic effects. The present study was specifically designed to establish the dose-response metabolism of glargine over 24 h following s.c. injection in T2DM subjects on long-term use of glargine.Ten subjects with T2DM were studied during 24 h after s.c. injection of 0.4 (therapeutic) and 0.8 (high dose) U/kg of glargine on two separate occasions during euglycaemic clamps (cross-over design). Glargine, M1 and M2 over 24 h period were determined in appropriately processed plasma samples by a specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Plasma M1 concentration (AUC0-24 h) was detected in all subjects and increased by increasing the glargine dose from therapeutic to high dose (p = 0.008). Glargine was detectable in 6 (therapeutic dose) and 9 (high dose) out of the 10 subjects and also increased by increasing the dose (p = 0.031). However, glargine concentration (AUC0-24 h--high dose) represented at most only 9.7% (4.6-15%) of the total amount of insulin measured in the blood. M2 was not detected at all.In T2DM people on long-term use of insulin glargine, even with higher doses (0.8 U/kg), glargine is nearly totally metabolized to the active metabolite M1. Glargine is often detectable in plasma, but its concentration remains well below that needed in vitro to potentiate IGF-1R binding and mitogenesis.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702815","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.764199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.73916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.712649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.706273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.642963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.638131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.624742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1","weight":0.574475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.409714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.356278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Mitogen","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Insulin glargine","weight":0.272342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_glargine"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.187497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.177041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor","weight":0.149228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1_receptor"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0392089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Therapeutic index","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Humulin","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humulin"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Chromosomal crossover","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover"}]}
