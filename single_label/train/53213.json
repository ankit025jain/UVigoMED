{"id":53213,"title":"Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the development of coronary heart disease and stroke subtypes in a general Japanese population: the Hisayama Study.","abstract":"It has not been fully determined whether non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDLC) levels are involved in vascular events, especially stroke, in general Asian populations. We evaluated the association between non-HDLC levels and the risk of type-specific cardiovascular disease in a prospective cohort study in Japan.A total of 2452 community-dwelling Japanese subjects aged?40 years were followed prospectively for 24 years.The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of coronary heart diseases (CHD) significantly increased with elevating non-HDLC levels (P for trend<0.001), but no such association was observed for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. With regard to ischemic stroke subtypes, the age- and sex-adjusted incidence of lacunar infarction significantly increased with elevating non-HDLC levels (P for trend<0.01), and such tendency was seen for atherothrombotic infarction (P for trend=0.098), while a significant inverse association was observed for cardioembolic infarction (P for trend=0.007). After adjustment for confounders, namely, age, sex, diabetes, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, electrocardiogram abnormalities, current drinking, current smoking, and regular exercise, the associations remained significant for CHD [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for a 1 standard deviation of non-HDLC concentrations=1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.02 to 1.35], atherothrombotic infarction (adjusted HR=1.39, 95% CI=1.09 to 1.79), and cardioembolic infarction (adjusted HR=0.64, 95% CI=0.47 to 0.85).Our findings suggest that elevated non-HDLC levels are a significant risk factor for the development of atherothrombotic infarction as well as CHD but reduce the risk of cardioembolic infarction in the general Japanese population.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Endocrine System
