{"id":68804,"title":"[A woman with needle-shaped crystals in the urine].","abstract":"A 24-year-old female patient was admitted to the ICU with suspected meningo-encephalitis. She was treated with antibiotics and acyclovir 1500 mg/day. Forty-eight hours later she developed acute renal failure with needle-shaped crystals in the urine. Acyclovir treatment was suspended and renal function replacement therapy was initiated. After two weeks, her renal function had fully recovered. Based on the typical clinical course and the typical crystalluria, we diagnosed her with acyclovir-induced acute renal failure.
