{"id":54944,"title":"Focal relationship between structure and function within the central 10 degrees in glaucoma.","abstract":"To investigate which measurements of inner macular thickness are the most useful for evaluating the focal relationship with visual sensitivity within the central 10° in glaucoma and which layers require correction for retinal ganglion cell (RGC) displacement.Sixty eyes of 60 subjects with glaucoma were included. Sensitivity of each test point of 10-2 standard automated perimetry was compared with the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), GCL+ inner plexiform layer (IPL), and RNFL+GCL+IPL (GCC), with and without RGC displacement, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Visual sensitivity was evaluated by unlogged 1/Lambert (1/L) values.Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness correlated significantly with the sensitivities of all test points except for some in the papillomacular bundle region when adjusting for RGC displacement (rs = 0.287-0.767, P < 0.05). In the central 5.8°, the GCL and (GCL+IPL) thickness correlated significantly with the sensitivities of all test points when adjusting for RGC displacement (GCL: rs = 0.363-0.729, P < 0.01; (GCL+IPL): rs = 0.359-0.715, P < 0.01). The GCC thickness correlated significantly with the sensitivities of all 68 test points when adjusting for RGC displacement (rs = 0.359-0.767, P < 0.01). RGC displacement improved the correlation between sensitivity and GCL, (GCL+IPL), and GCC in the central 4 points (GCL: rs = from 0.270-0.470 to 0.421-0.540; (GCL+IPL): rs = from 0.195-0.450 to 0.381-0.549; GCC: rs = from 0.132-0.449 to 0.359-0.562).The GCC is the most useful parameter to evaluate structure and function within the central 10° in glaucoma. Adjusting for RGC displacement is essential to evaluate the relationship between structure of the GCL-related layer and function at the central macula.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25082882","annotations":[{"name":"Retinal ganglion cell","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_ganglion_cell"},{"name":"Ganglion cell","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cell"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Ganglion cell layer","weight":0.820631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cell_layer"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Macula of retina","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula_of_retina"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Inner plexiform layer","weight":0.691396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_plexiform_layer"},{"name":"Nerve fiber layer","weight":0.671019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_fiber_layer"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.585583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.56633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Perimetry","weight":0.535634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimetry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.396944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nerve fiber","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_fiber"},{"name":"GNU Compiler Collection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection"},{"name":"Iran Pro League","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Pro_League"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"549","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/549"},{"name":"1320","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1320"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Law school in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_school_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Luminosity function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_function"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Rank correlation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_correlation"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Taxonomic rank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank"},{"name":"Boeing 767","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_767"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"470 (dinghy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/470_(dinghy)"},{"name":"Area code 562","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_562"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Rotters Golf Club","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotters_Golf_Club"},{"name":"IBM 3590","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3590"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0139782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"}]}
