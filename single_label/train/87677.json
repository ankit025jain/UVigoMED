{"id":87677,"title":"[Minimally invasive treatment for distal radial fracture and dislocation of type IV based on Fernandez classification].","abstract":"To investigate the effects of external fixation combined with minimally invasive internal fixation for the treatment of distal radial fracture and dislocation of type IV based on Fernandez classification.From January 2007 to October 2012,19 patients with the distal radius fracture and dislocation of type IV according to Fernandez classification were reviewed. There were 14 males and 5 females,ranging in age from 22 to 42 years old,with an average of 36.5 years old. All the patients were treated with minimally invasive reduction, and external fixation with finite internal fixation. The K-wire was used to fix radiolunate articular surface for correcting the instability of dorsal and volar intercalated segment. The radiolunate angle, scapholunate angle, and the length of the radial shorting were measured by the standard X-ray. Gartland and Werley evaluation system was used to evaluate recovery of function.No complications such as injury of blood vessels and radial nerves and pin track infections occurred. After operation, the radiolunate angle, scapholunate angle and the length of the radial shorting time were (9.5 +/- 3.3) degrees, (51.3 +/- 11.2) degrees and (11.2 +/- 1.8) mm by the standard X-ray. On the 3rd month after operation, GW score was 3.02 +/- 3.05. There was no re-displacement and subluxation occurred during the follow-up period. Good functional recovery were improved wrist function significantly.External fixation combined with minimally invasive internal fixation can treat distal radial fracture and dislocation of type IV based on Fernandez classification. Wrist joint stability depends on the structure of the bone and ligament around wrist joint. Emphasis on the diagnosis and treatment of carpal instability, and postoperative functional rehabilitation can improve wrist function.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029846","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.812922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Subluxation","weight":0.806949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subluxation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.747458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Distal radius fracture","weight":0.746321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radius_fracture"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.723856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.696827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.667628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Osteogenesis imperfecta","weight":0.663694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.647494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Radius (bone)","weight":0.524769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_(bone)"},{"name":"Radial nerve","weight":0.481348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_nerve"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.266938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.258811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.229403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0562587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"}]}
