{"id":37398,"title":"[Anesthetic management of a patient with diaphragmatic relaxation and megacolon].","abstract":"We managed an 87-year-old man with diaphragmatic relaxation under general anesthesia. He had dyspnea and severe constipation. The chest X-ray revealed that two thirds of the left chest cavity were compressed by the megacolon gas. The Spo2 before the operation was 93%. The colon gas was deflated before and after the induction of anesthesia. There was no significant improvement in the tidal volume and the arterial oxygen tension. The postoperative chest X-ray showed that the shift of the left diaphragm was improved. He was able to walk 100 meters and the severe constipation disappeared after the operation.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498779","annotations":[{"name":"Tidal volume","weight":0.959338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_volume"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.786484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Partial pressure","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.763874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Thoracic cavity","weight":0.573774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.526793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.255407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.222407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.140868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Tide","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide"},{"name":"Megacolon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacolon"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Electromagnetic induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"100 metres","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"},{"name":"Relaxation technique","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_technique"}]}
