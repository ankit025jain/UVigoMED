{"id":86222,"title":"A meta-analysis of pemetrexed-based doublet compared with pemetrexed alone for the second-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.","abstract":"This meta-analysis investigated pemetrexed-based doublet compared with pemetrexed alone as second-line therapy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Randomized controlled trials which compared pemetrexed-based doublet with single-agent pemetrexed in patients as second-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer were searched. Overall survival (OS) was the primary end point, while secondary end points included progression-free survival, overall response rate, 1-year survival rate, and grade 3 or 4 toxicity.Four eligible randomized clinical trials including 1,084 patients were selected. Meta-analysis demonstrated that pemetrexed-based doublet arm significantly improved the overall response rate (OR=2.70, 95% CI: 1.76-4.15, p=0.000), compared with docetaxel alone group, while there were no significant differences in overall survival (HR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.74-1.04, p=0.132), progression-free survival (HR=0.91, 95% CI: 0.73-1.15, p=0.443), and 1-year survival rate (OR=1.43, 95% CI: 0.85-2.40, p=0.178) between the two arms. However, there were more frequencies of grade 3-4 leucopenia (OR=2.86, 95% CI: 1.32-6.20, p=0.008), neutropenia (OR=2.69, 95% CI: 1.55-4.68, p=0.000) and thrombocytopenia (OR=6.92, 95% CI: 2.51-19.07, p=0.000) in pemetrexed-based doublet group. Grade 3-4 anemia (OR=0.62, 95% CI: 0.33-1.18, p=0.144) and fatigue (OR=1.15, 95% CI: 0.73-1.79, p=0.550) had equivalent incidences in the two groups.This is the first meta-analysis to compare pemetrexed-based doublet with single-agent pemetrexed in second-line therapy of non-small cell lung cancer. Our meta-analysis suggested that pemetrexed combination chemotherapy was not superior to single-agent arm and was not recommended as the second-line chemotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 6, Ref. 20).","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797599","annotations":[{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Pemetrexed","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemetrexed"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.604047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"History of cancer chemotherapy","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cancer_chemotherapy"},{"name":"Superior vena cava","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"SESAMO","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SESAMO"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"741","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/741"},{"name":"331","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/331"},{"name":"764","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/764"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"852","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/852"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Ficus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus"},{"name":"Winning percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Coat of arms","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms"},{"name":"Minuscule 326","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_326"}]}
