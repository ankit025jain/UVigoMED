{"id":82203,"title":"[Invisible and almost invisible orthodontic appliances].","abstract":"Patient demand for invisible esthetic orthodontic appliances is steadily increasing. Two types of orthodontic appliances have a high rate of patient acceptance. The lingual technique has continually evolved by offering both prefabricated brackets or custom-made brackets. The various techniques have been improved over time, and the results are better than ever. Thermoplastic aligners are an alternative to lingual devices and their use is rapidly growing. Their specific properties make it easier to assess their indications and limitations. A review of the literature, the development of these systems and a presentation of some clinical examples of treated cases will help us to provide some of the basics for understanding each of these two types of appliances and to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of each system.
