{"id":47794,"title":"New endoscopic classification system for biliary stricture after liver transplantation.","abstract":"A new classification system for biliary stricture (BS) after liver transplantation (LT) is proposed, aiming to standardize endoscopic treatment for this condition.Data were retrospectively collected from patients who had undergone endoscopic retrograde cholangiography after LT, and who provided endoscopy images clear enough to reveal the biliary system. Images were classified separately by two endoscopists, who discussed and resolved any disputed findings. From these images, a new classification system is proposed (Ling classification): type A, normal biliary structure; type B, anastomotic stricture and normal intrahepatic biliary structure; type C, narrow and stiff intrahepatic biliary structure or beaded intrahepatic biliary structure or intrahepatic biliary cast without anastomotic stricture; type D, narrow and stiff intrahepatic biliary structure or beaded intrahepatic biliary structure or intrahepatic biliary cast with anastomotic stricture.Analysis involved 93 patients: 76 men and 17 women, median age 54 years (range, 12-69 years). Type B was the most commonly observed BS after LT, accounting for 44 cases (47.3%). Type A, the least commonly observed type, accounted for nine (9.7%), type C for 22 (23.7%) and type D for 18 (19.3%) cases.A new endoscopic classification system for BS after LT is proposed, to help determine the most appropriate treatment for patients with each type of stricture.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573973","annotations":[{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.70715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.691491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.346584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.151533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.151152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0650786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Beadwork","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beadwork"},{"name":"Lithuania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania"},{"name":"1269","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1269"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Emperor Ling of Han","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Ling_of_Han"},{"name":"AC power plugs and sockets","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets"},{"name":"Orthopedic cast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_cast"},{"name":"Curse of 1940","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_1940"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Bachelor of Science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science"},{"name":"Cholangiography","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiography"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Stellar classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Blood type","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"D-type asteroid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-type_asteroid"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
