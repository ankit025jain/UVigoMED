{"id":72431,"title":"Analysis of the differences of serum protein mass spectrometry in patients with triple negative breast cancer and non-triple negative breast cancer.","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to investigate differences of serum protein mass spectrometry in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-TNBC and thus to search for candidate serum protein biomarkers for identification and diagnosis of TNBC. Thirty serum samples from patients with TNBC without any treatment and 30 serum samples from patients with non-TNBC without any treatment were detected by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser dissociation tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). PDQest 7.0 software of Bio-Rad was adopted to screen differentially expressed proteins. Protein ID retrieval was conducted by using Mascot software to confirm the results of differential proteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis profiles were obtained successfully. A total of 16 differential protein loci were discovered by analyzing patient sera of the two groups using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis software. Ten differential proteins were identified by mass spectrometric analysis in the 16 differential proteins. Combined with database and literature search results, it is speculated that the specifically upregulated proteins and downregulated proteins including transthyretin, haptoglobin, and antitrypsin may be the potential markers for early diagnosis of TNBC. Comparing the TNBC patients with the non-TNBC patients, there are differences in serum protein compositions. The ten differential proteins discovered in the present study provide reference basis for further improving early diagnosis and identification and diagnosis index of TNBC. Especially, transthyretin, haptoglobin, and antitrypsin show dramatic significances for the early diagnosis of TNBC.","date":"2014-10-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972967","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.824695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.746655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.693564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.69026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.559039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.505079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.331811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.329115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.324076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.286582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.210564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Alpha 1-antitrypsin","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_1-antitrypsin"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Triple-negative breast cancer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-negative_breast_cancer"},{"name":"Transthyretin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin"},{"name":"Protein mass spectrometry","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Dissociation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation"},{"name":"Differential equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation"},{"name":"Web search engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
