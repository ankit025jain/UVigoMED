{"id":31014,"title":"Endogenous endophthalmitis associated with intravenous drug abuse.","abstract":"To describe demographics, characteristics, and management of eyes with endogenous endophthalmitis (EE) in intravenous drug abusers.Retrospective chart review of patients with EE who presented to University Hospital, New Jersey Medical School between January 2005 and October 2012.Thirty-four patients presented with a clinical diagnosis of EE during this time period. Eighteen patients (53%) had a history of intravenous drug abuse with at least 15 of the 18 patients reporting intravenous heroin abuse. Average age was 43 years (24-61 years), 13 were men. Three patients had bilateral involvement. Mean time from the onset of symptoms to presentation was 10 days (range, 1-42 days). Presenting vision in the affected eye ranged from 20/100 to no light perception; the majority of patients had vision of counting fingers or worse. All patients were admitted to the hospital for intravenous antimicrobials and further workup. Final best-corrected visual acuity at the last follow-up ranged from 20/20 to no light perception, with most patients having final vision of 20/400 or worse.We reviewed 21 eyes of 18 patients with EE and concurrent intravenous drug abuse over an 8-year period; our study shows extremely poor visual prognosis associated with EE in this setting.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418848","annotations":[{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.633361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.576586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.516351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.475564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.447372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.42116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.407917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"New Jersey","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.312183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.208106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Endophthalmitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endophthalmitis"},{"name":"New Jersey Medical School","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Medical_School"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Jersey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020"},{"name":"Counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Estonia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"}]}
