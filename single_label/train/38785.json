{"id":38785,"title":"Treatment of angiofibromas in tuberous sclerosis complex: the effect of topical rapamycin and concomitant laser therapy.","abstract":"Facial angiofibromas are the most troublesome cutaneous manifestations of the tuberous sclerosis complex and are difficult to treat. Lasers are most commonly used to treat these skin lesions, but results are disappointing with frequent recurrences. Recently, treatment of facial angiofibromas with topical rapamycin has been reported to yield promising results. We observed the need of laser ablation in addition to topical rapamycin to get best results for the treatment of angiofibromas in 4 cases. The result showed that topical rapamycin ointment was enough when the papules were yet small in size, i.e. less than a few millimeters, but additional laser ablation was needed for large papules approximately larger than 4 mm. Considering the natural course of facial angiofibromas, we believe that topical rapamycin can be best used in childhood patients. In adults, topical rapamycin was useful for treating the still present small papules and for preventing recurrences after laser treatment.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401865","annotations":[{"name":"Topical","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Laser medicine","weight":0.687247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_medicine"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Papule","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papule"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.516275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Laser ablation","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_ablation"},{"name":"Tuberous sclerosis","weight":0.4,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberous_sclerosis"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0408852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Photorejuvenation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorejuvenation"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Natural history of disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history_of_disease"},{"name":"Tuber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuber"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"}]}
