{"id":66198,"title":"Enhancing proteasome-lnhibitor effect by functionalized gold nanoparticles.","abstract":"Colloidal gold nanoparticles intensify the anticancer response of the drug bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor. Polyethylene glycol-coated gold nanoparticles and the drug show a synergistic effect in reducing the cell viability of prostate cancer cell line Du145. It was observed a significant cell viability reduction with bortezomib concentrations as low as 4 nM. The proteasome inhibitor alone had to be present at concentrations in the ranger of 120 nM to induce identical cytotoxicity response. These findings demonstrate that gold nanoparticles enhancing the permeation and retention (EPR) effect in Du145 cells and open the possibility to decrease multi-drug resistance (MDR). The in vitro results of functionalized gold nanoparticles, internalized by cancer cells, pave the way for a more efficient proteasome inhibitor delivery and release in adenocarcinoma cells.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24734524","annotations":[{"name":"Bortezomib","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortezomib"},{"name":"Proteasome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.682984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.494288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.400137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Proteasome inhibitor","weight":0.382443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.373183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.219121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Colloidal gold","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloidal_gold"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Permeation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeation"},{"name":"Electron paramagnetic resonance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_paramagnetic_resonance"},{"name":"Endocytosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis"}]}
