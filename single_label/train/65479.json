{"id":65479,"title":"Long segment recanalization and dedicated central venous stenting in an ultimate attempt to restore vascular access central vein outflow.","abstract":"Maintaining vascular access in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis is a challenging process, especially in patients enduring multiple central line placements and in whom peripheral options have been exhausted.We present a case of a 60-year-old male without options for peripheral vascular access due to multiple failed arteriovenous fistulas for hemodialysis. Furthermore, bilateral subclavian, brachiocephalic veins and iliac veins were occluded or significantly obstructed. After long segment central vein recanalization, an upper arm loop arteriovenous graft was implanted. The recanalized segment was stented with a 12-mm dedicated venous nitinol stent.Chronic central vein obstructions demand stents with both high radial force and flexibility. We recommend dedicated venous stents to improve technical success and reduce stent-related complications like early re-occlusion due to fracturing, kinking or straightening.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24817466","annotations":[{"name":"Stent","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.728188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.545526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.470526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Peripheral vascular disease","weight":0.458297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vascular_disease"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.350845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Brachiocephalic vein","weight":0.289395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiocephalic_vein"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.288635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Central venous catheter","weight":0.287256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Radial artery","weight":0.268635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_artery"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.258455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.182496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Subclavian artery","weight":0.0706695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclavian_artery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0492338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Nickel titanium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_titanium"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Central force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_force"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"Flexibility (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexibility_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Maintaining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintaining"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Outflow (meteorology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outflow_(meteorology)"},{"name":"Hair straightening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_straightening"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Brachiocephalic artery","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiocephalic_artery"}]}
