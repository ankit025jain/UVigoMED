{"id":7580,"title":"Species H rotavirus detected in piglets with diarrhea, Brazil, 2012.","abstract":"We determined nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the rotavirus gene encoding viral protein 6 from 3 fecal samples collected from piglets with diarrhea in Brazil, 2012. The analyses showed that the porcine rotavirus strains in Brazil are closely related to the novel species H rotavirus.
