{"id":61393,"title":"[Imaging examinations in lymphoma].","abstract":"Imaging examinations are necessary in the various clinical situations of malignant tumors including lymphoma, which are differential diagnosis, staging, evaluation of response to treatment, prognosis prediction or early diagnosis of relapse. Generally morphologic imaging(such as CT, MRI and US) and functional imaging(such as gallium scintigraphy and FDG-PET) are used for malignant lymphoma. Especially, CT and FDG-PET have quite important roles for multicenter studies of treatment according to the response criteria of lymphoma. In this chapter, the features of each imaging examinations in lymphoma were explained. In addition, interim PET was mentioned at the end, which is considered as a promising biomarker for stratifying treatment of lymphoma.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724398","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Scintigraphy","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintigraphy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.791357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.785708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.622487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.57535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.565672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.254341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Gallium","weight":0.250341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"}]}
