{"id":62911,"title":"Enlarged memory T-cell pool and enhanced Th1-type responses in chronic myeloid leukemia patients who have successfully discontinued IFN-? monotherapy.","abstract":"A small proportion of chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with interferon-? (IFN-?) monotherapy are able to discontinue the treatment without disease relapse although residual leukemia cells are present. Recently, we showed that these patients have increased amount of NK-cells and a distinct blood cytokine profile. We now aimed to study the function of NK- and T-cells in order to understand the role of the immune system in maintaining the treatment response after IFN-? discontinuation. The study included 13 patients: 5 patients were still treated with IFN-? monotherapy (IFN-ON, median treatment time 163 months) and 8 had stopped the treatment successfully (IFN-OFF, median time without therapy 42 months). Detailed immunophenotype and cytokine production of NK- and T-cells was analyzed with flow cytometry. In addition, the cytotoxicity of NK-cells was studied using K562 as target cells and both the degranulation and direct killing was measured. Compared to healthy controls, IFN-OFF patients had increased proportion of CD4(+) effector memory (CCR7(-)CD45RA(-); median 23% vs. healthy 16%, p = 0.009) and CD8(+) central memory T-cells (CCR7(+)CD45RA(-); median 26% vs. healthy 14%, p = 0.004). Further, upon stimulation the IFN-?/TNF-? cytokine secretion by CD4(+) T-cells was significantly enhanced in IFN-OFF patients (median 13.7% vs. healthy 7.8%, p = 0.01), and CD4+ effector and central memory cells were the main cytokine producers. No similar increase was observed in IFN-ON group (6.5%). In addition, the proportion of NK-cells was significantly increased in IFN-OFF patients (median IFN-OFF 24%, healthy 13%, p = 0.04), but their direct killing of K562 cells was impaired. The cytotoxicity of NK-cells was also diminished in IFN-ON patients. To conclude, in addition to elevated NK-cell count, IFN-OFF patients have increased amount of memory T-cells, which are able to induce strong cytokine response upon stimulation. This activity may contribute to the maintenance of prolonged remission after successful IFN-? discontinuation.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498197","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immunophenotyping","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunophenotyping"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.779394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.741734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Degranulation","weight":0.711048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degranulation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.666054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.654891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"PTPRC","weight":0.649257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPRC"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.610462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.49837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.333004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"CC chemokine receptors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Memory B cell","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_B_cell"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"}]}
