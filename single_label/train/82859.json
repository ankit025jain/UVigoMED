{"id":82859,"title":"[Complex treatment of oral mucosa cancer].","abstract":"The analysis of the results of complex treatment of 58 patients with oral mucosa cancer was conducted. In the main group of 20 patients used a method developed by the authors comprehensive treatment, including chemoradiotherapy (CRT), cryodestruction (CD) of the tumor, followed by 24 hours of local microwave hyperthermia. In the control group of 38 patients with complex treatment consisted of a CRT and a CD of the tumor. Local recurrence rate of tumor growth in the first 12 months of observation in the main group patients was (7.7 +/- 5.96)%, in the control group--(31.6 +/- 7.54)%. The frequency of regional metastases for the entire observation period was (34.2 +/- 7.54)%--in the control group, in the main group were absent. The use of local microwave hyperthermia in a day after tumor CD allows to raise not only local, but also the overall anti-tumor effect of the CD and in general, comprehensive treatment.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501920","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.763194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.722519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.634476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.379879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.374893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.307213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cathode ray tube","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube"},{"name":"Microwave","weight":0.241444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.155885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.145929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1 decametre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decametre"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Main group element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_group_element"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
