{"id":8729,"title":"IL-18, but not IL-12, induces production of IFN-? in the immunosuppressive environment of HPV16 E7 transgenic hyperplastic skin.","abstract":"IFN-? has a central role in the defense against infections and cancer. More recently, however, IFN-? has also been reported to have immunosuppressive effects in models of autoimmune disease, melanoma, and premalignant skin disease. Although IL-12 and IL-18 are critical inducers of IFN-? during infection, the mechanisms that induce IFN-? in an immunosuppressive context are unknown. Previously, we identified a key role for IFN-? in mediating the suppression of antigen-specific immune responses in a transgenic mouse model of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated epidermal hyperplasia, driven by the expression of the HPV16 E7 oncoprotein from a keratin 14 promoter (K14E7). We now demonstrate elevated production of IFN-?, IL-18, and IL-12 by K14E7 transgenic skin compared with nontransgenic skin. IFN-? in K14E7 transgenic skin was produced predominantly by CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells, which were present in greater numbers in K14E7 transgenic skin. Production of IFN-? in K14E7 skin required IL-18 but not IL-12. Our findings show that IL-18 contributes to inducing IFN-? in an immunosuppressive cutaneous environment caused by viral oncogene-driven hyperplasia.
