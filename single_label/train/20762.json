{"id":20762,"title":"Treatment and prevention of Mycobacterium ulcerans infection (Buruli ulcer) in Australia: guideline update.","abstract":"• Guidelines reflecting contemporary clinical practice in the management of Buruli ulcer (Mycobacterium ulcerans infection) in Australia were published in 2007. • Management has continued to evolve, as new evidence has become available from randomised trials, case series and increasing clinical experience with oral antibiotic therapy. • Therefore, guidelines on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of Buruli ulcer in Australia have been updated. They include guidance on the new role of antibiotics as first-line therapy; the shortened duration of antibiotic treatment and the use of all-oral antibiotic regimens; the continued importance, timing and role of surgery; the recognition and management of paradoxical reactions during antibiotic treatment; and updates on the prevention of disease.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641151","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.640183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.613516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.580865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.569827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.562485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.531742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.490611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.473737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Paradox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox"},{"name":"Paradoxical reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxical_reaction"},{"name":"Buruli ulcer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buruli_ulcer"},{"name":"Mycobacterium ulcerans","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_ulcerans"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
