{"id":37402,"title":"[Fiberoptic tracheal intubation through a laryngeal mask airway in a pediatric patient with treacher collins syndrome].","abstract":"A 6-month-old girl with Treacher Collins syndrome was scheduled for tracheotomy because of severe airway obstruction. During slow induction of anesthesia with inhalation of sevoflurane, assisted mask ventilation was successfully performed using oropharyngeal airway. Either direct laryngoscope or GlideScope Video Laryngoscope could not reveal any part of the epiglottis (Cormack and Lehane grade 4). Even fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination assisted by GlideScope Video Laryngoscope gave a poor view of the pharynx on the video monitor. Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was inserted easily and allowed adequate ventilation, through which fiberoptic intubation was successfully achieved. We cut the LMA short in order to pass the 3 mm tracheal tube until the glottis through it.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498771","annotations":[{"name":"Laryngeal mask airway","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_mask_airway"},{"name":"Tracheotomy","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy"},{"name":"Oropharyngeal airway","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oropharyngeal_airway"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Sevoflurane","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevoflurane"},{"name":"Glottis","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Epiglottis","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiglottis"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.76253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.729548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Tracheal tube","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_tube"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.547437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.455346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Airway obstruction","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_obstruction"},{"name":"Video monitor","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_monitor"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"}]}
