{"id":86520,"title":"Act fast and ventilate soft: the Düsseldorf hands-on translation of the acute respiratory distress syndrome Berlin definition.","abstract":"Early identification of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and forceful implementation of standardized therapy algorithms are the mandatory basis of an effective therapy to improve patient outcome. Recently, a new definition of ARDS was implemented, which simplified the diagnostic criteria for ARDS. Evidence-based therapies are rare, but some cornerstone interventions can be recommended. Lung-protective ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure and low tidal volume and early prone positioning in severe cases improve survival rate. We here present an integrated \"Düsseldorf hands-on translation\" in the form of a \"one-page\" standard operating procedure in order to fasten and standardize both diagnosis and therapeutic algorithms on an intensive care unit.
