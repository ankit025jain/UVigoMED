{"id":22653,"title":"Expression of the E-cadherin/?-catenin/tcf-4 pathway in gastric diseases with relation to Helicobacter pylori infection: clinical and pathological implications.","abstract":"To determine the expression of E-cadherin, ?-catenin, and transcription factor 4 (TCF4) proteins in gastric diseases with relation to Helicobacter pylori infection.A total of 309 patients including 60 with superficial gastritis (SG), 57 with atrophic gastritis (AG) and 192 with gastric cancer (GC), were enrolled. The expression of E-cadherin, ?-catenin, TCF4 proteins in the gastric mucosa was detected by immunohistochemistry and H. pylori infection by immunohistochemistry and PCR.The expression rates of E-cadherin were significantly higher in SG and AG than in GC (P<0.01), while those of ?-catenin in the nucleus were significantly lower in SG and AG than in GC (P<0.05). In GC cases, the expression rates of E-cadherin, ?-catenin and TCF4 were significantly higher in the intestinal type than in the diffuse type (P<0.05). In GC patients, the expression rate of E-cadherin was significantly higher in the presence of H. pylori than in the absence of infection (P=0.011). Moreover, the expression level of TCF4 and ?-catenin protein was significantly higher in the nucleus and cytoplasm in H. pylori positive than in H. pylori negative GC patients, especially in those with the intestinal type (all P < 0.05).The expression of E-cadherin and ?-catenin progressively decreases during the process of GC tumorigenesis, while overexpression of TCF4 occurs. H. pylori infection is associated with a significant increase in the expression of E-cadherin and ?-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus in GC patients, especially those with the intestinal type.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528029","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.735011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Atrophic gastritis","weight":0.535303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophic_gastritis"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.395524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.393226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.180524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Gastric mucosa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_mucosa"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
