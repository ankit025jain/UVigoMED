{"id":87931,"title":"Normal saline influences coagulation and endothelial function after traumatic brain injury and hemorrhagic shock in pigs.","abstract":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hemorrhagic shock (HS) are the leading causes of trauma-related deaths. These insults disrupt coagulation and endothelial systems. This study investigated whether previously reported differences in lesion size and brain swelling during normal saline (NS), colloids (Hextend [HEX]), and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) resuscitation are associated with differential effects on coagulation and endothelial systems.We subjected 15 Yorkshire swine to TBI and HS (40% blood volume), and kept in HS for 2 hours before resuscitation with NS, HEX, or FFP. Markers of endothelial activation (E-selectin, Intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM]-1), coagulation activation (prothrombin fragment 1 + 2), and natural anticoagulation (activated protein C [aPC]) were determined in serum and brain whole cell lysates.Serum levels of aPC were greater in the NS group (203 ± 30 pg/mL) compared with HEX (77 ± 28 pg/mL; P = .02) and FFP (110 ± 28 pg/mL; P = .09), as was PF 1 + 2 in the brain when compared with FFP (PF 1 + 2, 89 ± 46 vs 37 ± 14 ng/mL; P = .035). Brain E-selectin was greater in the NS group compared with FFP (3.36 ± 0.02 vs 3.31 ± 0.01 ng/mL; P = .029). Circulating ICAM-1 levels were increased in the NS group (151 ± 9 ng/mL) compared with the HEX (100 ± 9 ng/mL; P < .01) and FFP (108 ± 9 ng/mL; P = .01).In this clinically realistic large animal model of TBI + HS, NS resuscitation was associated with an early activation of coagulation, natural anticoagulation, and endothelial systems, compared with HEX and FFP.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24953275","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Fresh frozen plasma","weight":0.876069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_frozen_plasma"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.844821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Cerebral edema","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.742257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Protein C","weight":0.688914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_C"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.680462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.590954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.585769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.564861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Colloid","weight":0.558225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.548236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.307503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.179812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.114958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Blood volume","weight":0.114558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_volume"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0789213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"ICAM-1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Food preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_preservation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
