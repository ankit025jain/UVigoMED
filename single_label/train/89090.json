{"id":89090,"title":"[Study on occupational safety climate in different types of enterprises and its relationship with occupational accidental injury].","abstract":"To evaluate the occupational safety climate in different types of enterprises and its relationship with occupational accidental injury.A cross-sectional survey based on self-report questionnaires was performed among 3311 front-line workers from 54 medium and small-sized manufacturing enterprises of different types in Zhongshan, China to investigate the socio-demographic characteristics, safety climate experience in workplace, and incidence of occupational accidental injury in the past year.Analysis of the data revealed that employees in different types of companies perceived different levels of safety climate, according to the scores on four subscales; the European and American enterprises had significantly better safety climate than the Hong Kong and Chinese private enterprises (P < 0.01). The self-reported rates of occupational injury were 3.38%, 4.76%, and 6.72%, respectively, for European and American, Hong Kong, and Chinese private enterprises (?(2) = 6.78, P < 0.05). After control of such factors as age, sex, income, education level, and marriage, the logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of occupational accidental injury in the European and American enterprises was significantly lower than that in the Chinese private enterprises (OR = 0.57, 95%CI = 0.35-0.91).The type of enterprise influences the occupational safety climate and incidence of occupational injury among workers.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754937","annotations":[{"name":"China","weight":0.710965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.694196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Business","weight":0.678346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"},{"name":"Hong Kong","weight":0.667143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.541329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.475431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.417844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.33461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Climate","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.23094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.189899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Zhongshan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongshan"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Injury prevention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_prevention"}]}
