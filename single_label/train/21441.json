We instituted an enhanced surveillance program for CRE that identified unrecognized CRE-colonized patients but failed to identify possible CRE transmissions. We also identified risk factors associated with transmitting CRE.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602948","annotations":[{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Transmitter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter"},{"name":"List of states with limited recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_limited_recognition"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Transmission (telecommunications)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(telecommunications)"},{"name":"NSA warrantless surveillance controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_controversy"}]}
