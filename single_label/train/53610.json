{"id":53610,"title":"Effect of liver transplantation on glucose levels in patients with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"Liver transplantation (LT) may induce the occurrence of diabetes mellitus. It can be speculated, however, that the LT may have a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism. We therefore conducted a study to examine the changing trends in blood glucose levels before and after LT in patients with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.In this observational study, we enrolled 47 patients (38 prediabetes and 9 diabetes) who underwent LT. We compared the blood glucose levels between the pre-transplantation (24 months) and the post-transplantation (36 months) periods and analyzed the diverse factors affecting glucose levels.The glucose regulation worsened and insulin dose increased in patients with diabetes, which was notably seen during the steroid maintenance period. Following steroid withdrawal, however, there was a decrease in the insulin dose in 55.6% of the patients, and 33.3% of the patients converted from insulin to oral agents. Of the patients with prediabetes, 55.3% developed new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT). However, 18.4% achieved a recovery of glucose levels to normal range. Of the 21 NODAT patients, 52.4% achieved a recovery of glucose level to the prediabetes range after steroid withdrawal. There was a significant correlation between the old age and the persistence of NODAT (P < .05).LT may have a diverse effect on glycemia, which may lead to changes in glucose control methods. Therefore, glucose metabolism after LT may need to be differentiated by the underlying glucose disturbance status and the time after LT with or without steroid maintenance period.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507056","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.806856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.560555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.548787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.436741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.370534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.241876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.215191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.182608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Prediabetes","weight":0.166355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Lithuania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania"},{"name":"Persistent organic pollutant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
