{"id":68043,"title":"Predicting 24-hour urinary protein excretion in Afro-Caribbean Barbadians by comparing urine protein excretion over different durations versus spot collection.","abstract":"The gold standard for the determination of proteinuria, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease, is the measurement of protein in a 24-hour urine collection. However this method has been shown to be unreliable mainly due to poor compliance of sampling by patients. This study investigates other appropriate means of predicting 24-hour urinary protein excretion in a sample of Afro-Caribbeans in Barbados by assessing the correlation of actual and estimated urinary protein excretion between a 24-hour urine collection sample, 12-hour (AM and PM) and spot (AM and PM) urine collections.A convenient sample of 30 healthy participants of Afro-Caribbean origin between the ages of21 and 55 years was recruited for the study The 24-hour urine samples and anthropometric data were collected as documented in the study s standard clinical procedure. A 24-hour urine sample was collected as two separate 12-hour AM and PM samples. In addition, two spot samples (AM and PM) were taken during each 12-hour sample collection period. Analysis of the urinary protein and creatinine was done with a Roche/Hitachi Modular System (Roche Diagnostics, IN, USA). SPSS version 19 was used to analyse the data to make inferences.Thirty Afro-Caribbean persons participated in the study: 16 females and 14 males. The average age and body mass index (BMI) were 38 +/- 17 years and 25.32+/- 5.98 kg/m2, respectively. The Spearman Rho 's correlation was used to interpret associations of the urinary parameters in 24-hour collected sample and the other samples. The strongest correlation of the protein:creatinine ratio in the 24-hour collected sample to the other samples was observed with the 12-hour AM sample (r = + 0.743, p < O.01)followed by the 12-hour PM sample (r = +0.672, p < 0.01). On analysing gender, the more significant correlations found were among the males for the 12-hour timed samples with r = +0.945, p < 0.01 and r = +0.736, p < 0.01 for the AM and PM samples, respectively. There were very strong correlations between the 24-hour urinary protein excretion and the estimated 24-hour protein excretion from the 12-hour AM and PM samples (r = +0.846, p < 0.01 and r = +0.637, p < 0.01, respectively). Both males and females had the strongest correlation for the estimation of 24-hour protein excretion in the 12-hour AM sample (r = +0.795, p < 0.01 and r = +0.965, p < 0.01, respectively).The use ofa 12-hour timed sample, specifically the morning sample, may be a more convenient way to assess proteinuria in the Afro-Caribbean population. This method allows for a quicker assessment of proteinuria which not only allows earlier diagnosis of renal disease but may also reduce the clinical cost of the disease s management.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564038","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass
