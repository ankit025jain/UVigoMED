{"id":82758,"title":"Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for salivary gland dysfunction and xerostomia: a systematic review of preclinical studies.","abstract":"The most severe forms of xerostomia and salivary gland dysfunction, as well as a severely reduced quality of life, are seen in Sj√∂gren syndrome (SS) and after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. For both conditions, no effective regenerative therapies yet exist. Thus, the aim of this article was to assess, through systematic review, the potential benefit of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in radiation-induced and SS-related salivary gland dysfunction and xerostomia. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Google Scholar. We identified 6 separate study comparisons eligible for inclusion. Owing to the limited number of studies, we conclude that more randomized, adequately powered clinical trials are needed to validate the potential beneficial effect of MSCs on salivary gland dysfunction and xerostomia. Nonetheless, the preliminary studies identified in the present review were encouraging for further research.
