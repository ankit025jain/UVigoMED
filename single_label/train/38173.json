{"id":38173,"title":"Impact of long-acting octreotide in patients with early-stage MEN1-related duodeno-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.","abstract":"Somatostatin analogues (SSA) represent one of the main therapeutic option in patients affected with functioning well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). There are no studies specifically focusing on NETs associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1).To evaluate the efficacy of the long-acting SSA octreotide in MEN1 patients with early-stage duodeno-pancreatic NETs.Forty patients with MEN1 were retrospectively evaluated. Twenty patients with evidence of one or more MEN1-related duodeno-pancreatic NETs < 20 mm in size (age range 26-61 years) were treated with octreotide long-acting octreotide (LAR) as first-line therapy. Treatment duration ranged 12-75 months. At the baseline radiological evaluation, multiple duodeno-pancreatic NETs (range 1-8, size 3-18 mm) were detected.An objective tumour response was observed in 10%, stable disease in 80% and progression of disease in 10% of cases. In six patients with abnormally increased CgA, gastrin and/or insulin serum concentrations, a significant clinical and hormonal response occurred in 100% of cases and was stable along the time.Therapy with SSA is highly safe and effective in patients with early-stage MEN1 duodeno-pancreatic NETs, resulting in long-time suppression of tumour and hormonal activity and 10% objective response. This suggests to early start therapy with SSA in patients with MEN1-related NETs.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24443791","annotations":[{"name":"Octreotide","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octreotide"},{"name":"Gastrin","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrin"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Somatostatin","weight":0.78517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.762319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.729313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.538096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"MEN1","weight":0.247654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEN1"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia","weight":0.0394773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_endocrine_neoplasia"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"1275","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1275"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"20 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Laredo Heat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laredo_Heat"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"}]}
