{"id":53175,"title":"Metformin resistance alleles in polycystic ovary syndrome: pattern and association with glucose metabolism.","abstract":"Insulin-sensitizer treatment with metformin is common in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). OCT alleles were investigated in PCOS patients to identify genetic 'bad responders' and 'nonresponders' to metformin including their possible effects on glucose metabolism without treatment. We genotyped eight SNPs in OCT1, OCT2 and ATM genes in 676 women with PCOS and 90 control women, we also measured oral glucose tolerance tests prior to treatment. Nonfunctional alleles were present in 29.8% and low-functional alleles in 57.9% of our PCOS cohort. OCT variants were significantly associated with elevated baseline and glucose-induced C-peptide levels in PCOS. Metformin bad responders or nonresponders based on OCT genotypes might be relevant in clinical practice - their modulation of metformin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and metformin-independent glucose effects remain to be elucidated.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533710","annotations":[{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.690689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.672072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.620886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.510532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.328393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Automated teller machine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_teller_machine"},{"name":"SLC22A1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLC22A1"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
