{"id":22246,"title":"Outcomes after endocarditis or device infection in patients with left ventricular epicardial leads versus coronary sinus leads.","abstract":"There is scant data about outcomes in patients with left ventricular epicardial (LVE) leads who develop endocarditis or device-related infection.This retrospective study evaluated mortality and recurrence of infection among patients with LVE leads in comparison to patients with endovascular coronary sinus (CS) leads after the development of endocarditis or device-related infection.Patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices who developed endocarditis or pocket infection over 5 years at Cleveland Clinic were included in the study. The groups were all patients with LVE leads versus CRT devices without epicardial leads that developed endocarditis or pocket infection. Mortality was assessed using the Social Security Death Index and re-infection was assessed by reviews of the medical record.Prospective extraction of the CRT device and leads occurred among all 50 patients with CS leads and 8 of the 14 patients with LVE leads. The survival rate was 92.9 versus 92 % and freedom from re-infection rate was 64.3 versus 80 % in the patients with LVE leads versus CS leads, respectively, over 1 year (P value?=?0.918 and 0.226, respectively). At 3 years, the survival rate in LVE lead group was 92.9 % and freedom from re-infection rate was 64.3 % in comparison to survival rate of 90 % and freedom from re-infection rate of 68 % in the CS group (P value?=?0.751 and 0.798, respectively).After development of endocarditis or pocket infection, no statistically significant differences were seen in mortality, or recurrent infection between patients with LVE leads and those with CS leads.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
