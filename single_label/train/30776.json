{"id":30776,"title":"A European community pharmacy-based survey to investigate patterns of prescription fraud through identification of falsified prescriptions.","abstract":"To identify prescription drugs involved in falsified prescriptions in community pharmacies in 6 European countries.A cross-sectional survey among 2,105 community pharmacies in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden was carried out to collect all suspect prescription forms. For each reported drug, the number of reported falsified prescriptions per thousand inhabitants was estimated. A falsification ratio was calculated by dividing the number of reports by the number of defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day for this drug, computed from national sale or reimbursement data.On 862 prescription forms, benzodiazepines (zolpidem, bromazepam, alprazolam), buprenorphine (as an opioid maintenance drug) and tramadol were the most frequently reported. Depending on their level of use in each country, methylphenidate, morphine and flunitrazepam presented the highest falsification ratios, particularly in Spain, Belgium and France.Stimulants, opioids and some benzodiazepines were the most frequently reported drugs in this survey on falsified prescriptions, but differences between countries were observed.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24458222","annotations":[{"name":"Flunitrazepam","weight":0.931565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flunitrazepam"},{"name":"Tramadol","weight":0.912877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol"},{"name":"Zolpidem","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zolpidem"},{"name":"Alprazolam","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam"},{"name":"Buprenorphine","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine"},{"name":"Methylphenidate","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate"},{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.785671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.74952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Bromazepam","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromazepam"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.716365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Belgium","weight":0.598387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"},{"name":"France","weight":0.594475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.534824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.514594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.290145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Heroin-assisted treatment","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin-assisted_treatment"},{"name":"Fraud","weight":0.0262373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"European Economic Community","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Falsifiability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"}]}
