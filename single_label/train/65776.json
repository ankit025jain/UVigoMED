{"id":65776,"title":"Tobacco exposure in children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease: parental behavior and knowledge. A study from the Midwest Pediatric Nephrology Consortium.","abstract":"The incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high. Exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) is a known risk factor for CVD. Due to a recent report of high incidence of SHS in children with CKD, we sought to investigate via questionnaire the smoking behaviors of caregivers of children with CKD.A cross sectional study was conducted in which caregivers of children and adolescents with CKD were asked to complete a single anonymous self-administered survey.Almost 40% of children and adolescents lived with one or more smokers. Over half of smokers smoked in the presence of their children and in the car. Smokers were significantly less aware of the detrimental effect of SHS exposure on the renal health of their children. Among smokers, almost 70% reported they had not been advised by their child's nephrologist to quit tobacco use.There is a high prevalence of SHS exposure among children and adolescents with CKD, which may contribute to CVD. Caregivers are not fully aware of the detrimental effects of SHS exposure on the renal health of their children.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780552","annotations":[{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.741293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.712649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.690752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Passive smoking","weight":0.673944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.614946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.40255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.133181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Smoke","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke"},{"name":"Anonymity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity"},{"name":"Cross-sectional study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study"},{"name":"Midwestern United States","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}]}
