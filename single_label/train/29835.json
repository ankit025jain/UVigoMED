{"id":29835,"title":"Role of personality traits in cocaine craving throughout an outpatient psychosocial treatment program.","abstract":"Cocaine dependence is a major international public health concern. Its chronically relapsing nature is possibly related to craving intensity, which can be influenced by diverse biological and psychological aspects. This study aimed to evaluate the role of different personality traits in craving measured throughout a psychosocial treatment program.The sample comprised 66 cocaine-dependent outpatients who were enrolled in an individual and manualized cognitive-behavioral therapy program. The influence of personality traits on craving intensity, frequency, and duration was analyzed using a generalized estimating equations model with an autoregressive correlation structure.Craving varied during treatment. The personality traits of novelty seeking, reward dependence, and harm avoidance interacted with craving intensity, and the personality trait of persistence interacted with craving duration throughout the treatment period. Furthermore, there were significant interactions between drug use and craving intensity, and between different routes of administration and craving intensity. Participants who used cocaine/crack while in treatment and concurrent users of crack (i.e., freebase) cocaine and powder cocaine also had a higher craving intensity.The extent of craving variation can depend on certain personality styles. This study shows that craving is influenced by personality traits, and this may presumably change clinical expression involved in disease.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604459","annotations":[{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.814871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.806541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.711179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.667952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.563195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.552802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.434593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Free base","weight":0.420962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_base"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.364373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Personality psychology","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.247364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Reward system","weight":0.131235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Crack cocaine","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Powder (substance)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(substance)"},{"name":"Trait theory","weight":0.0289305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_theory"},{"name":"Cocaine dependence","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine_dependence"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Avoidant personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Estimation theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Craving (withdrawal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craving_(withdrawal)"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
