{"id":15848,"title":"Trends in antifungal susceptibility of Candida species--one year observation.","abstract":"In the past years opportunistic fungal infections have seriously increased, mainly in immunocompromised patients. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of yeast-like fungi in invasive candidiasis and to estimate its susceptibility to chosen antifungal agents. One hundred and sixty strains of yeast-like fungi were cultured from various clinical material: samples from lower respiratory tract, blood, the peritoneal cavity and others. The susceptibility tests were established according to the quantitative E-test method. The Candida genus represented the main etiological factor of invasive candidiasis. The predominant species were: C. glabrata (71/160), C. albicans (34/160), C. krusei (17/160), C. tropicalis (14/160). All tested strains were the most resistant to itraconazole. Candida glabrata presented the 100% susceptibility to amphotericin B and caspofungin and was the least susceptible to itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole. Candida albicans was the most susceptible species to all antymicotics.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25115116","annotations":[{"name":"Itraconazole","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itraconazole"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Caspofungin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspofungin"},{"name":"Voriconazole","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voriconazole"},{"name":"Amphotericin B","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphotericin_B"},{"name":"Candida glabrata","weight":0.875245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_glabrata"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.867542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Candidiasis","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidiasis"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.772597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.771872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.761355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Opportunistic infection","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_infection"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.675131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Posaconazole","weight":0.622417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posaconazole"},{"name":"Candida krusei","weight":0.595056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_krusei"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.576106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.300935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Candida tropicalis","weight":0.232943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_tropicalis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Peritoneal cavity","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneal_cavity"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"}]}
