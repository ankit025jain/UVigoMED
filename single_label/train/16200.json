{"id":16200,"title":"[Protein toxins of Staphylococcus aureus].","abstract":"Main scientific-research studies regarding protein bacterial toxins of the most widespread bacteria that belong to Staphylococcus spp. genus and in particular the most pathogenic species for humans--Staphylococcus aureus, are analyzed. Structural and biological properties of protein toxins that have received the name of staphylococcus pyrogenic toxins (PTSAg) are presented. Data regarding genetic regulation of secretion and synthesis of these toxins and 3 main regulatory genetic systems (agr--accessory gene regulator, xpr--extracellular protein regulator, sar--staphylococcal accessory regulator) that coordinate synthesis of the most important protein toxins and enzymes for virulence of S. aureus, are presented.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051707","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.766442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.719171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.673266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.649835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.613397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.22732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.165836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system"}]}
