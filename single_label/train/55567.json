{"id":55567,"title":"High-irradiance accelerated collagen crosslinking for the treatment of keratoconus: six-month results.","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of accelerated corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) with riboflavin for keratoconus by the change in dioptric power and corneal topography.Private practice, Tokyo, Japan.Case series.The accelerated CXL treatments (KXL system) were performed using a 10-minute riboflavin 0.1% (Vibex Rapid) soak and a 3-minute ultraviolet-A (UVA) irradiance at a level of 30 mW/cm(2). This corresponds to a total radiant exposure of 5.4 J/cm(2). Preoperative and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperative examinations were performed.The study enrolled 39 eyes of 22 patients. The mean uncorrected distance visual acuity showed a statistically significant improvement, from 1.11 ± 0.42 logMAR preoperatively to 0.89 ± 0.53 logMAR 6 months postoperatively (P<.01). The mean maximum keratometry readings also changed significantly, from 49.95 ± 6.11 diopters (D) preoperatively to 49.19 ± 5.82 D at 6 months (P<.01). There were no statistically significant changes in the endothelial cell density between preoperatively and postoperatively.The changes after accelerated CXL were similar to those after conventional CXL. Thus, accelerated CXL has the potential to efficiently treat and halt the progression of keratoconus and may be an effective, efficient therapeutic option for treating corneal ectatic disease.No
