{"id":50605,"title":"The influence of radioiodine therapy on the number of circulating epithelial cells (CEC) in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma - a pilot study.","abstract":"The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the changes of circulating epithelial cells in the blood of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer after radioiodine-therapy with I-131.The cells were detected by fluorescence-microscopy via the epithelial-cell-adhesion-molecule (EpCAM), a molecule described to be over-expressed in most carcinoma tissues and also present on circulating cells deriving from primary site. Epithelial cells were assessed before radioiodine-therapy, as well as 2 days, 14 days, and 3 months after therapy. 2 patient groups were examined: 1) patients with thyroid cancer receiving a first radioiodine-therapy after thyroidectomy (RITfirst, n=13), and 2) patients with thyroid cancer in need of repeated radioiodine-therapy due to local or metastatic recurrences (RITrep, n=15). Circulating epithelial cell changes were correlated to changes of serum-thyroglobulin and to clinical response evaluated 3 months after therapy.Patients with an early decrease of cells after radioiodine-therapy (RITfirst 7/13; RITrep 2/15) showed an increase of serum-thyroglobulin in most of the cases (RITfirst 5/7; RITrep 2/2). In the RITrep group, a decrease in cell counts 2 days after radioiodine-therapy indicated a clinical response in 90% of the cases.This study indicates that the number of circulating epithelial cells in differentiated thyroid cancer undergo changes in response to radioiodine-therapy. The destruction of cells through radioiodine-therapy may induce a short-term release of thyroglobulin in the blood. A clear relationship between the clinical outcome and the cell changes could not be found, but early cell decreases may help identifying patients more likely to respond to radioiodine-therapy.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771011","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Iodine-131","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.676248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.141013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Epithelial cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial_cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Canadian Electroacoustic Community","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Electroacoustic_Community"}]}
