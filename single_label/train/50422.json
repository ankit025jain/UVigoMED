{"id":50422,"title":"Tumoricidal activity of combining the agonistic DR5 antibody D-6 with cisplatin in C30 cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo.","abstract":"A previous study by our group reported that the agonistic DR5 antibody D-6 was capable of triggering apoptosis in A2780 cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cells and that this marked effect was enhanced by cisplatin in vitro. The present study examined whether D-6 and cisplatin may exert the same anti-tumor effect on C30 cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells, and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. D-6 exhibited an apoptosis-inducing effect, increased the cell growth inhibition rate of C30 cells in a dose-dependent manner, induced significant morphological changes characteristic for apoptosis, as observed by electron microscopy, and downregulated the expression of caspase 3, 8 and 9 precursors in C30 cells treated with D-6 at the protein level. All of these effects were evidently enhanced when accompanied by cisplatin. Furthermore, D-6 alone or in combination with cisplatin in the established models of C30 tumor xenografts resulted in a significant repression of tumor growth, and evident apoptosis, as determined by a terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. In addition, the expression of caspase 3, 8 and 9 precursors in the tumor xenografts was as similar to that found in vitro. In conclusion, the present study suggested that D-6 may serve as a novel anti-tumor agent against C30 cisplatin?resistant ovarian cancer, with the ability to trigger apoptosis via caspase-dependent and ?independent pathways and the potential to decrease the cisplatin resistance of the C30 cell line.
