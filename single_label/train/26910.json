{"id":26910,"title":"Usefulness of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels to predict success of weaning from intra-aortic balloon pumping.","abstract":"There is currently no reliable method of predicting the success of weaning from intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP). The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level to predict the success of weaning from IABP. Consecutive patients scheduled for weaning from IABP were prospectively enrolled. NT-proBNP levels were measured at baseline (before the start of weaning) and cessation (just before cessation of IABP). Changes in NT-proBNP level between baseline and cessation were analyzed in 2 groups of patients: those who were successfully weaned and those who were not successfully weaned for any reason, including a decision to discontinue weaning, worsening of pulmonary edema after cessation of IABP, or unstable hemodynamics after cessation of IABP. A total of 30 patients were enrolled (mean age 66 Â± 12 years, 16 men, 16 with acute myocardial infarctions, and 14 with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure). Median (interquartile range) baseline NT-proBNP levels were not significantly different between the successful and unsuccessful weaning groups (4,200 [1,400 to 8,752] pg/ml vs (5,620 [2,035 to 13,950] pg/ml, p = 0.30). In the unsuccessful weaning group, the median NT-proBNP level was significantly higher at cessation (9,995 [2,920 to 15,100] pg/ml) than at baseline (p = 0.008). All patients with decreases in NT-proBNP level between baseline and cessation were successfully weaned from IABP. In conclusion, these results show that NT-proBNP levels were useful for predicting the success of weaning from IABP. If the NT-proBNP level increases during weaning from IABP, more intense management should be considered.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073567","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary edema","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_edema"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.748291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.569365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.296238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.289224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.279407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Weaning","weight":0.142224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Intra-aortic balloon pump","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intra-aortic_balloon_pump"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/995"},{"name":"950","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/950"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"920","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/920"},{"name":"Breast pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_pump"},{"name":"Natriuretic peptide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natriuretic_peptide"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_exacerbation_of_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
