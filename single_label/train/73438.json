{"id":73438,"title":"Expression of serum toll-like receptor 9 and oxidative damage markers in benign and malignant breast diseases.","abstract":"The intracellular redox environment plays an important role in the maintenance of proper cellular homeostasis and functions. Disturbances in redox equilibrium of cells result in pro-inflammatory conditions, and these inflammatory conditions can induce carcinogenesis or increase the malignant potential of the tumor. Oxidative stress or tissue damage can trigger toll-like receptor (TLR) family of receptors that are involved in altering the innate immune system. The present study was aimed at evaluating the level of oxidative damage markers in breast diseases by measuring the 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), protein carbonyl (PC), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant status (TAS) alterations in relation to expression of TLR-9. A significant increase in the level of oxidative damage markers was observed in breast carcinoma patients in comparison to benign and normal controls, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in TAS and expression of TLR-9 concentrations. 8-OHdG, PC, and MDA were negatively correlated with expression of TLR-9 and TAS levels. Altered levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress and TLR-9 among the malignant, benign, and controls suggest a correlation of oxidative stress and TLR signaling in the progression of disease in breast carcinoma patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis depicts that expression of TLR-9 is a good indicator for distinguishing cancer patients from benign and normal controls. High accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of oxidative stress markers and expression of TLR-9 can be used as discriminatory marker/s for efficient diagnosis.
