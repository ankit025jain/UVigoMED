{"id":67435,"title":"[Recent advances in treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer after docetaxel failure].","abstract":"The standard first-line treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is docetaxel-based chemotherapy. However, CRPC may not respond to docetaxel due to drug resistance or other causes. Several new therapeutic agents have been developed, some of which are approved by FDA or on clinical trials. The mechanisms of action of these agents include stabilizing microtubules, inhibiting hormone synthesis, blocking androgen receptor, bone targeting or immune regulation. In this article we review the novel therapeutic options for CPRC after docetaxel failure.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616470","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.5758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.512807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.465761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.454078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.383257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.328889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.272203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Microtubule","weight":0.131144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
