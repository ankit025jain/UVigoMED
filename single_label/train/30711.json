{"id":30711,"title":"[Confirmed poisonings with ethylene glycol and methanol in south Poland in the years 2010-2012 based on results from toxicological laboratories in Kraków and Sosnowiec].","abstract":"The purpose of the research was to present the number of ethylene glycol and methanol poisonings in south Poland in the years 2010-2012, based on data from toxicological laboratories in Kraków and Sosnowiec. Total numbers of positive determinations of the toxic alcohols were 380-ethylene glycol and 152-methanol. Most of the patients poisoned with the toxic alcohols were men (87.4%), the mean age of the patients was 48.1 years. Mean ethylene glycol concentration in samples from poisoned patients was 57.5 mg/dl in serum and 286.2 mg/dl in urine; mean blood methanol concentration was 1.4 g/l. Samples collected from poisoned patients treated on the area of whole voivodeship were determined in toxicology laboratories. According to information about orderers of ethylene glycol and methanol tests, positive results of the toxic alcohols were the most often in big cities and in cities, where department of toxicology were located (Kraków and Sosnowiec). In many cases patients were treated in hospitals in small cities, and samples collected from patients were transported to perform toxicological determination. The study shows, that intoxications with ethylene glycol and methanol are a big problem in Poland and the number of methanol poisonings markedly increased in the years 2010-2012.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466682","annotations":[{"name":"Methanol","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.661005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.556612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.474091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Antidote","weight":0.405859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidote"},{"name":"Ethylene","weight":0.341472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.317447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Ethylene glycol","weight":0.303889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.302581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.156225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Sosnowiec","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosnowiec"},{"name":"Voivodeship","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivodeship"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"286","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/286"},{"name":"380","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/380"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Advice and consent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_and_consent"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Galician language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language"}]}
