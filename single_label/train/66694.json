{"id":66694,"title":"Laparoscopic sentinel lymph node versus hyperextensive pelvic dissection for staging clinically localized prostate carcinoma: a prospective study of 200 patients.","abstract":"Lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic factor in prostate cancer (PC). The aim of this prospective study was to validate, through laparoscopic surgery, the accuracy of the isotopic sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique correlated with hyperextensive pelvic resection (extended pelvic lymphadenectomy dissection) in patients with localized PC, candidates for local curative treatment.A transrectal ultrasound-guided injection of (99m)Tc-sulfur rhenium colloid (0.3 mL/100 MBq) in each prostatic lobe was performed the day before surgery. Detection was performed intraoperatively with a laparoscopic probe, followed by extensive resection. SLN counts were performed in vivo and confirmed ex vivo. Histologic analysis was performed by hematoxylin-phloxine-safran staining, followed by immunohistochemistry if the SLN was free of metastasis.Two hundred three patients with PC at intermediate or high risk of lymph node metastases were included. The intraoperative detection rate was 96% (195/203). Thirty-five patients had lymph node metastases, 19 only in the SLN. The false-negative rate was 8.5% (3/35). Unilateral surgical SLN detection did not validate bilateral pelvic lymph node status, and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy dissection was necessary on the opposite side of detection to minimize the false-negative rate (2.8% [1/35]). A significant metastatic sentinel invasion in the common iliac region existed (9.3%) but was always associated with other metastatic node areas. The internal iliac region was the primary metastatic site (40.7%). Finally, this series invalidated any justification for a standard or limited dissection, which would have missed 51.9% and 74.1% of lymph node metastases, respectively.The radioisotope SLN identification method up to the common iliac region is successful to identify sentinel nodes during laparoscopic surgery per hemipelvis to be acceptably considered as an isolated procedure and should be validated for intermediate- and high-risk patients.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686781","annotations":[{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.897476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Colloid","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid"},{"name":"Sentinel lymph node","weight":0.821081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_lymph_node"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.792926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.69692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.565672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.555505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.461266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Becquerel","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becquerel"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.291335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.209804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0175845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"}]}
