{"id":32798,"title":"The design and delivery of a PKA inhibitory polypeptide to treat SCA1.","abstract":"Spinocerebellar ataxia-1 (SCA1) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily targets Purkinje cells (PCs) of the cerebellum. The exact mechanism of PC degeneration is unknown, however, it is widely believed that mutant ataxin-1 becomes toxic because of the phosphorylation of its serine 776 (S776) residue by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Therefore, to directly modulate mutant ATXN1 S776 phosphorylation and aggregation, we designed a therapeutic polypeptide to inhibit PKA. This polypeptide comprised of a thermally responsive elastin-like peptide (ELP) carrier, which increases peptide half-life, a PKA inhibitory peptide (PKI), and a cell-penetrating peptide (Synb1). We observed that our therapeutic polypeptide, Synb1-ELP-PKI, inhibited PKA activity at concentrations similar to the PKI peptide. Additionally, Synb1-ELP-PKI significantly suppressed mutant ATXN1 S776 phosphorylation and intranuclear inclusion formation in cell culture. Further, Synb1-ELP-PKI treatment improved SCA1 PC morphology in cerebellar slice cultures. Furthermore, the Synb1-ELP peptide carrier crossed the blood-brain barrier and localized to the cerebellum via the i.p. or intranasal route. Here, we show the intranasal delivery of ELP-based peptides to the brain as a novel delivery strategy. We also demonstrate that our therapeutic polypeptide has a great potential to target the neurotoxic S776 phosphorylation pathway in the SCA1 disease.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903464","annotations":[{"name":"Protein kinase A","weight":0.919392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_A"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.797407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.792843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Purkinje cell","weight":0.748916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_cell"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.659502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.653635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.634837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Spinocerebellar ataxia","weight":0.469199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinocerebellar_ataxia"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.375452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.307422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.208641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.134085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Protein aggregation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_aggregation"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"}]}
