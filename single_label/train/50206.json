{"id":50206,"title":"Early recurrence of early stage endometrioid endometrial carcinoma: possible etiologic pathways and management options.","abstract":"The majority of endometrial cancers is early stage and of the endometrioid histological type, as the symptoms (mainly vaginal bleeding) of the disease lead to an early diagnosis. Close follow-up is nevertheless essential in such cancers staged early on, in which the rate of recurrence is relatively low. We retrieved the studies included in our narrative review after performing a systematic electronic search in the PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane databases. The incidence or recurrence of disease in such patients could be up to 2.6%, with the main sites of recurrence being the vaginal vault or metastases in distant parts of the body. Genetic factors such as p53 overexpression, inactivation of 14-3-3-sigma, KRAS amplification and KRAS mRNA expression, microsatellite instability and Lynch syndrome genes could be associated with such a recurrence. Black race is also correlated, as well as lymphovascular space involvement, lower uterine segment involvement and DNA aneuploidy. Longer hysteroscopy duration was not found to be associated. Close follow-up is suggested for early detection of recurrences, while surgical excision of isolated disease or exenteration of local disease as well as radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the main treatment options. This narrative review investigated the possible mechanisms of early recurrence in patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer as well as the further management of them.
