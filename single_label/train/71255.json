{"id":71255,"title":"Systemic distribution, subcellular localization and differential expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors in benign and malignant human tissues.","abstract":"Five sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1PR): S1PR1, S1PR2, S1PR3, S1PR4 and S1PR5 (S1PR1-5) have been shown to be involved in the proliferation and progression of various cancers. However, none of the S1PRs have been systemically investigated. In this study, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for S1PR1-S1PR5 on different tissues, in order to simultaneously determine the systemic distribution, subcellular localization and expression level of all five S1PRs.We constructed tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 384 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks containing 183 benign and 201 malignant tissues from 34 human organs/systems. Then we performed IHC for all five S1PRs simultaneously on these TMA slides. The distribution, subcellular localization and expression of each S1PR were determined for each tissue. The data in benign and malignant tissues from the same organ/tissue were then compared using the Student's t-test. In order to reconfirm the subcellular localization of each S1PR as determined by IHC, immunocytochemistry (ICC) was performed on several malignant cell lines.We found that all five S1PRs are widely distributed in multiple human organs/systems. All S1PRs are expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, except S1PR3, whose IHC signals are only seen in the nucleus. Interestingly, the S1PRs are rarely expressed on cellular membranes. Each S1PR is unique in its organ distribution, subcellular localization and expression level in benign and malignant tissues. Among the five S1PRs, S1PR5 has the highest expression level (in either the nucleus or cytoplasm), with S1PR1, 3, 2 and 4 following in descending order. Strong nuclear expression was seen for S1PR1, S1PR3 and S1PR5, whereas S1PR2 and S1PR4 show only weak staining. Four organs/tissues (adrenal gland, liver, brain and colon) show significant differences in IHC scores for the multiple S1PRs (nuclear and/or cytoplasmic), nine (stomach, lymphoid tissues, lung, ovary, cervix, pancreas, skin, soft tissues and uterus) show differences for only one S1PR (cytoplasmic or nuclear), and twenty three organs/tissues show no significant difference in IHC scores for any S1PR (cytoplasmic or nuclear) between benign and malignant changes.This is the first study to evaluate the expression level of all S1PRs in benign and malignant tissues from multiple human organs. This study provides data regarding the systemic distribution, subcellular localization and differences in expression of all five S1PRs in benign and malignant changes for each organ/tissue.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25084322","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.875419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.873641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.869774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.813139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.752197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.720725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.485378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.285727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
