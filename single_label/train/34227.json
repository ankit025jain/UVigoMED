{"id":34227,"title":"Unusual variability of PRRT2 linked phenotypes within a family.","abstract":"Mutations in the proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) gene on chromosome 16p11.2 have recently been identified as a cause of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias (PKD), infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA) syndrome or infantile convulsions (IC).Here, we describe a family with four affected members. They all suffer from different diseases: febrile convulsion, epileptic seizures, PKD or headache.The whole coding region of PRRT2Â gene has been analyzed.Molecular testing revealed the PRRT2 gene mutation c649.delC in exon 2 for all three sibs as well as for the mother.Our presented family case shows the great variability within PRRT2 linked phenotypes even within the same family. Further and more detailed studies will be needed before genetic findings enter into the daily diagnostic and the daily genetic counseling with all its consequences.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755245","annotations":[{"name":"Exon","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Convulsion","weight":0.872036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convulsion"},{"name":"Transmembrane protein","weight":0.837143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_protein"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Genetic counseling","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_counseling"},{"name":"Chromosome 16 (human)","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_16_(human)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Polycystic kidney disease","weight":0.697468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Febrile seizure","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febrile_seizure"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.47851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Coding region","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Paroxysmal attack","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_attack"},{"name":"Dyskinesia","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyskinesia"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"}]}
