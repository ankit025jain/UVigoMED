{"id":42449,"title":"Factors associated with hepatitis C infection among patients with skin diseases.","abstract":"The present study attempted to assess factors associated with positive anti-HCV among patients with skin diseases.A retrospective analysis of 3,496 subjects' history profiles from the HCV antibody surveillance projects performed from 2000 to 2007. Only 150 subject profiles with skin diseases were included in the analysis of factors associated with positive anti-HCV Patient profiles including socio-demographic parameters, the main risk behavior or risk exposure, types of skin diseases, anti-HIV status, and results of anti-HCV were analyzed using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test.Results revealed that only 10 from 150 studied patients (6.7%) were positive for anti-HCV antibody. Patient profiles including socio-demographic parameters, the main risk behavior or risk exposure, types of skin diseases, and anti-HIV status among patients with or without anti-HCV were compared and analyzed to assess factors associated with positive anti-HCV. It was found that patient's income, types of skin disease, and anti-HIV status were significantly associated with positive anti-HCV among this group, p = 0.0240, p = 0.0053 and p = 0.0462, respectively.This analysis found three studied factors including patient's income, types of skin disease, and anti-HIV status to be significantly associated with HCV infection in patients with skin diseases. However, a large-scale work should be done to confirm the present study.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851568","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.802167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.705099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.688108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.681948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.677395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.63294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.330911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"History","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0845957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Exact test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Fishers, Indiana","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishers,_Indiana"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"}]}
