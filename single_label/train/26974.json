{"id":26974,"title":"Simultaneously successful transfemoral aortic valve implantation and endovascular repair of thoracic aortic saccular aneurysm.","abstract":"The prevalence of aortic stenosis (AS) increases in the elderly. They present high surgical risk due to comorbid factors that increase with age. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective method in patients who present with severe aortic stenosis with a higher surgical risk or who cannot undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (s-AVR). In our case, the presence of saccular thoracic aortic aneurysm with severe AS, which is a vital co-morbidity, requires the treatment of both. The rise in systolic pressure following the TAVI procedure increases the saccular thoracic aneurysm rupture risk and this is why the timing and method of the two treatments become crucial. In this case, which is as far as we know the fi rst and only report in the literature, both TAVI and endovascular thoracic aortic saccular aneurysm repair were applied simultaneously and successfully to the patient via the same transfemoral route. After 1 month, the patient had good functional capacity and there were no complications in control tomography and echocardiography. In this way, we attempted to emphasize with a multidisciplinary study that the patients be assessed carefully before the procedure, and found that even in patients with common peripheral vascular diseases, a transfemoral route could be used together with the proper methods, and that both procedures could be performed simultaneously.
