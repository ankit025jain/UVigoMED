{"id":61471,"title":"MicroRNA theragnostics for the clinical management of multiple myeloma.","abstract":"Theragnostics represent cutting-edge, multi-disciplinary strategies that combine diagnostics with therapeutics in order to generate personalized therapies that improve patient outcome. In oncology, the approach is aimed at more accurate diagnosis of cancer, optimization of patient selection to identify those most likely to benefit from a specific therapy and to generate effective therapeutics that enhance patient survival. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are master regulators of the human genome that orchestrate myriad cellular pathways to control growth during physiologic and pathologic conditions. Compelling evidence shows that miRNA deregulation promotes events linked to tumor initiation, metastasis and drug resistance as seen in multiple myeloma (MM), an invariably fatal hematologic malignancy. miRNAs are readily detected in body fluids, for example, serum, plasma, urine, as well as circulating tumor cells to demonstrate their potential as readily accessible, non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutics. Specific miRNAs are aberrantly expressed early in myelomagenesis and may more readily detect high-risk disease than current methods. Although only recently discovered miRNAs have rapidly advanced from preclinical studies to evaluation in human clinical trials. The development of miRNA theragnostics should provide widely applicable tools for the targeted delivery of personalized medicines to improve the outcome of patients with MM.
