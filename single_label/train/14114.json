{"id":14114,"title":"Bifidobacterium adolescentis protects from the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in a mouse model.","abstract":"To investigate the hypothesis that an oral supplementation of Bifidobacterium adolescentis protects against a diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in a mouse model, C57BL/6 mice were fed either a Western-style or a control diet±tap water fortified with B. adolescentis (5×10(7) cfu/ml) ad libitum for 12 weeks. Mice fed a Western-style diet gained significantly more weight than mice fed a control diet and developed a mild steatohepatitis. Western-style diet fed groups concomitantly treated with B. adolescentis had significantly decreased liver damage, whereas portal endotoxin levels and toll-like receptor-4 protein levels as well as myeloid differentiation factor 88 mRNA were increased in livers of both Western-style diet fed groups. The protective effects of the B. adolescentis were associated with a significant attenuation of the formation of reactive oxygen species, activation of nuclear factor ?B (NF?B) and induction of markers of inflammation in the liver. Taken together, our data suggest that an oral supplementation of the B. adolescentis attenuates diet-induced steatohepatitis, and this effect is associated with prevention from lipid peroxidation, NF?B activation and finally inflammation in the liver.
