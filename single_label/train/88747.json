{"id":88747,"title":"An anatomical and cadaveric study examining the risk of sural nerve injury in percutaneous Achilles tendon repair using the Achillon device.","abstract":"Percutaneous Achilles tendon repairs are gaining in popularity. This study aims to quantify the risk of sural nerve injury when using the Achillon device.The Achillon device was instrumented into 15 cadaveric specimens and through dissection the rate of sural nerve puncture and the position of the sural nerve in relation to the Achilles tendon was documented.The sural nerve was found lateral to the Achilles tendon insertion point over a range of 14.3mm and crossed the lateral border of the Achilles tendon over a range of 57.7mm. The sural nerve was punctured a total of 6 times and in 4 out of 15 cadaveric specimens (27%). Four out of the 6 punctures occurred when the Achillon device was instrumented distally.The sural nerve displays a highly variable anatomical course and there is a risk of puncture during percutaneous Achilles tendon repair using the Achillon device.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796825","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.474518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Achilles tendon","weight":0.412222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.407416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.125004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.0628681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Sural nerve","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sural_nerve"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Thermometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer"},{"name":"Border","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lateral border of the scapula","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_border_of_the_scapula"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Tag_Team_Champions_(WWE)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"}]}
