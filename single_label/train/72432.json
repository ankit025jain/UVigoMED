{"id":72432,"title":"Afatinib enhances the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutic agents by eradicating cancer stem-like cells.","abstract":"Cancer stem cells (CSC) have garnered significant attention as a therapeutic focus, based on evidence that they may represent an etiologic root of treatment-resistant cells. Indeed, expression of the multidrug resistance protein ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) confers chemoresistance to CSCs, where it serves as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. Here, we show that afatinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases EGFR, HER2, and HER4, preferentially eliminated side population cells with CSC character, in both cell lines and patient-derived leukemia cells, by decreasing ABCG2 expression. In these cells, afatinib also acted in parallel to suppress self-renewal capacity and tumorigenicity. Combining afatinib with the DNA-damaging drug topotecan enhanced the antitumor effect of topotecan in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations suggested that ABCG2 suppression by afatinib did not proceed by proteolysis through the ubiquitin-dependent proteosome, lysosome, or calpain. Instead, we found that afatinib increased DNA methyltransferase activity, thereby leading to methylation of the ABCG2 promoter and to a decrease in ABCG2 message level. Taken together, our results advocate the use of afatinib in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs to improve efficacy by improving CSC eradication.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972892","annotations":[{"name":"Lysosome","weight":0.903277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome"},{"name":"Proteasome","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Topotecan","weight":0.855011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topotecan"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.796984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.79342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.719035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"DNA methyltransferase","weight":0.678936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methyltransferase"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.634441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.556219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"P-glycoprotein","weight":0.527551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-glycoprotein"},{"name":"Calpain","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calpain"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.152882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.125212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"ERBB4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERBB4"},{"name":"Methyltransferase","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyltransferase"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"}]}
