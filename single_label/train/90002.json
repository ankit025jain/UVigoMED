{"id":90002,"title":"[Calculation of radiation loads in a space station compartment with a secondary shielding].","abstract":"Doses from space ionizing radiation were estimated using a model of ISS cosmonaut's quarters (CQ) outfitted with secondary shielding (\"Protective shutter\" (PS) as part of experiment MATRYOSHKA-R). Protective shutter is a \"blanket\" of water-containing material with mass thickness of - 6 g/cm2 covering the CQ exterior wall. Calculation was performed specifically for locations of experimental dosimetry assemblies. Agreement of calculations and experimental data reaching accuracy - 15% proves model applicability to estimating protective effectiveness of secondary shielding in the present-day and future space vehicles. This shielding may reduce radiation loading onto crewmembers as an equivalent dose by more than 40% within a broad range of orbit altitudes equally during the solar minimum and maximum.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660246","annotations":[{"name":"Ionizing radiation","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"International Space Station","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"},{"name":"Spacecraft","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Space station","weight":0.666928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.602094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Orbit","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.565859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Equivalent dose","weight":0.520715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_dose"},{"name":"Altitude","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"List of cosmonauts","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cosmonauts"},{"name":"Dosimetry","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimetry"},{"name":"Solar minimum","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_minimum"},{"name":"Radiation protection","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection"},{"name":"Mountain range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Radio broadcasting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_broadcasting"},{"name":"Shutter (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_(photography)"},{"name":"Solar neutrino problem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino_problem"},{"name":"National Order of Quebec","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Order_of_Quebec"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Blanket","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanket"},{"name":"Calculation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation"}]}
