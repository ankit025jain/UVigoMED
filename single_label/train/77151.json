{"id":77151,"title":"The global burden of aortic stenosis.","abstract":"Degenerative, calcific valvular aortic stenosis (AS), caused by an active process of atherosclerosis, calcification and ossification, is the most common cause of AS in industrialized nations. The prevalence of calcific AS is age-dependent, and thus is expected to increase due to demographic aging of the global population. It is well recognized that severe AS carries a poor prognosis if left untreated. Despite this recognition, many patients are inappropriately denied surgery because of perceived risk. This article will examine the etiology, prevalence, and current trends in the treatment of degenerative AS focusing on indications for surgical aortic valve replacement.
