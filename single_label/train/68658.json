{"id":68658,"title":"[Extra peritoneal anterior pelvic exenteration with total urethrectomy and vaginectomy for bladder and urethra cancer - clinical case and review of literature].","abstract":"The anterior pelvic exenteration is technically demanding surgical intervention carried out in advanced malignant genito-urethral process origin. It is characterized by a high percentage of intra and postoperative complications. They can be reduced through new surgical techniques, such as extra peritoneal approach to perform this operation. We present a clinical case of 56 years old patient with adenocarcinoma of the urethra/bladder established histologically by TUR (Transurethral) - biopsy. Of the clinical and imaging studies - data for the invasion to the anterior vaginal wall. The patient is after Total Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo oophorectomy on the occasion of the fibroids in the uterus. After a routine preoperative preparation, we did: extra peritoneal anterior pelvic exenteration with total urethrectomy and vaginectomy. Bilateral extra peritoneal ureterocutaneostomy with \"JJ\" stents. Bilateral extra peritoneal pelvic lymph dissection. Our clinical case, proves the thesis of many authors about the benefits of extra peritoneal approach for anterior pelvic exenteration. Reduce significantly the intra/post-operative complications, hospital stay and a time to follow postoperative therapy. We consider that the extra peritoneal approach for radical surgery should be applied whenever possible in the interest of the health of the patient.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505640","annotations":[{"name":"Pelvic exenteration","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_exenteration"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Oophorectomy","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oophorectomy"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Vaginectomy","weight":0.807742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginectomy"},{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Uterine fibroid","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_fibroid"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.486358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.237726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"In utero","weight":0.23476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_utero"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Thesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
