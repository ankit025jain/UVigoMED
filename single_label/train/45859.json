{"id":45859,"title":"[Metagenomics in studying gastrointestinal tract microorganism].","abstract":"Animal gastrointestinal tract contains a complex community of microbes, whose composition ultimately reflects the co-evolution of microorganisms with their animal host. The gut microbial community of humans and animals has received significant attention from researchers because of its association with health and disease. The application of metagenomics technology enables researchers to study not only the microbial composition but also the function of microbes in the gastrointestinal tract. In this paper, combined with our own findings, we summarized advances in studying gastrointestinal tract microorganism with metagenomics and the bioinformatics technology.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660620","annotations":[{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.775558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Coevolution","weight":0.637993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coevolution"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.451315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Metagenomics","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics"},{"name":"Termite","weight":0.0900983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
