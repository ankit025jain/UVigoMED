{"id":86289,"title":"Anatomical thoracoscopic segmentectomy for lung cancer.","abstract":"Minimally invasive surgery for lung cancer has seen considerable progress. A segmentectomy is less invasive than a lobectomy as it preserves lung parenchyma. The preservation of pulmonary function can reduce complications. The combination of a thoracoscopic approach with a segmentectomy should be less invasive, and retrospective studies have shown that the thoracoscopic approach is safe and feasible due to the lower postoperative mortality and complication rates as compared to an open thoracotomy. The validity of a segmentectomy for ground-glass-opacity-type lung cancer has been demonstrated, and it has also been evaluated for small, predominantly solid, lung cancers. Two prospective studies of segmentectomy versus lobectomy for ?2-cm non-small-cell lung cancer are now underway (CALGB 140503 and JCOG0802/WJTOG4607L) and should clarify the role of segmentectomy. Regarding thoracoscopic segmentectomy, few retrospective studies have reported the oncological outcome for lung cancer and there is inadequate evidence regarding the long-term oncological outcome, although the perioperative complication rate and duration of hospital stay seem to be non-inferior to those of an open approach. For preoperative simulation, three-dimensional multidetector computed tomography (3D-CT) is essential for performing an atypical thoracoscopic segmentectomy safely. Preoperative 3D-CT angiography and bronchography (3D-CTAB) enable accurate identification of the venous branches in the affected segment and the intersegmental vein. This review describes the surgical and oncological outcomes, utility of 3D-CTAB, and surgical techniques and procedure used for a thoracoscopic segmentectomy.
