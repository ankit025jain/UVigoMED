{"id":55497,"title":"Prospective randomized contralateral eye evaluation of subjective quality of vision after wavefront-guided or wavefront- optimized photorefractive keratectomy.","abstract":"To compare the effect of wavefront-guided (WFG) and wavefront-optimized (WFO) photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) on patient perceived quality of vision.Seventy-one patients (142 eyes) were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, fellow eye controlled study. One eye was randomized to undergo WFG PRK treatment by the AMO Visx CustomVue S4 IR excimer laser system (Abbott Medical Optics, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and the fellow eye received WFO PRK treatment by the Alcon Allegretto Wave Eye-Q 400 Hz excimer laser system (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX). Patients answered questionnaires on their visual symptoms and quality of vision preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.Patients in both groups reported better vision compared to baseline from 3 months onward (mean change in score of 1.56 to 2.51 in the WFO group and 1.54 to 2.28 in the WFG group, P ? .003). Both groups experienced less nighttime glare from 6 months onward (P ? .030). Halos, double vision, and visual clarity were initially worse (P ? .025) but not significantly different after 1 month. Haze and fluctuating vision resolved after 3 months. Visual symptoms were similar between the two groups at all times (P ? .059) except at 6 months, when patients felt their WFG eyes had more excellent vision (P = .029). A composite of all symptoms was also similar between the groups until 12 months when patients had fewer symptoms in their WFO eye (P = .044).One year after surgery, patient self-reported visual symptoms were not significantly different in eyes receiving WFG or WFO PRK. However, the average of all symptoms was lower in eyes receiving wavefront-optimized treatment.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24868564","annotations":[{"name":"Laser","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Wavefront","weight":0.651267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.541117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Diplopia","weight":0.519634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia"},{"name":"Excimer laser","weight":0.395956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer_laser"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.390174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.333385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.300935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.297784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.286088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Photorefractive keratectomy","weight":0.185256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy"},{"name":"Glare (vision)","weight":0.172593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glare_(vision)"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tempo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo"},{"name":"Fort Worth, Texas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Excimer","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer"},{"name":"Alcon","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcon"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Texas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Halo (optical phenomenon)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(optical_phenomenon)"},{"name":"Fellow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow"},{"name":"AMO","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMO"},{"name":"Photorefractive effect","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_effect"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Santa Clara, California","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California"}]}
