{"id":74803,"title":"[Impacts on the lower limb motor function in children with spastic cerebral palsy treated by Jin three-needle therapy combined with MOTOmed intelligent motor training].","abstract":"To compare the differences in the efficacy on lower limb motor function in children with spastic cerebral palsy between the combined therapeutic program of Jin three-needle therapy and MOTOmed intelligent motor training and the simple MOTOmed.Eighty children with spastic cerebral palsy were randomized into an observation group and a control group, 40 cases in each group. In the observation group, Jin three-needle therapy was used at four mind points, three brain points, three intelligent points, three temporal points, three knee points and three foot points, as well as Chengjin (BL 56), Chengshen (BL 57) and the other. Additionally, MOTOmed was given in assistance with conventional rehabilitation training. In the control group, MOTOmed and the conventional rehabilitation training were adopted. In the two groups, the treatment was given once a day, 20 treatments made one session and there were 3 to 5 days at interval between the two sessions. The efficacy evaluation was performed after continuous 3 sessions of treatment. The gross motor function measure (GMFM) and modified Ashworth scale (MAS) were applied for the evaluation before and after treatment in the two groups.After 3 sessions of treatment, GMFM score was increased apparently as compared with that before treatment in the two groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). After treatment, GMFM score in the observation group was increased more remarkably than that in the control group (55.32 +/- 17.10 vs 47.48 +/- 17.18, P < 0.05). After treatment, the total effective rate of gastrocnemius Ashworth spasm grade [90.0% (36/40)] in the observation group was better apparently than [72.5% (29/40)] in the control group (P < 0.05).The combined therapeutic program of Jin three-needle therapy and MOTOmet intelligent motor training improves the lower limb motor function of the children with spastic cerebral palsy and its efficacy is better than simple MOTOmed.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25233652","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Cerebral palsy","weight":0.785519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_palsy"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.651766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.503466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Spasm","weight":0.473412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm"},{"name":"Gastrocnemius muscle","weight":0.455372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrocnemius_muscle"},{"name":"Lower limb","weight":0.315729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_limb"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.258455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.230777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Spastic diplegia","weight":0.13653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spastic_diplegia"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0822264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0272758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Convention (norm)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"British Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Library"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Gross motor skill","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_motor_skill"},{"name":"Spastic","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spastic"}]}
