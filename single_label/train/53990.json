{"id":53990,"title":"Cushing's syndrome due to a bronchial ACTH-secreting carcinoid successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA).","abstract":"The ectopic production of ACTH is responsible for approximately 10% of cases of Cushing's syndrome. Whenever possible, once hypercortisolemia is under control with medical therapy, the final treatment consists of surgical excision of the tumor. We report a case of a patient with high surgical risk and poor response to medical therapy in which hypercortisolemia has been successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of the bronchial carcinoid tumor.A 43-year-old woman came to our hospital because of severe and rapidly worsening signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism over the previous 3 months. Hormonal tests suggested the presence of Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic ACTH production. Imaging studies detected an 8-mm pulmonary nodule with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake localized in the middle right lobe. The patient started therapy with ketoconazole with poor response. Middle right lobectomy was indicated but, due to the patient's very high surgical risk, a thermal ablation with radiofrequency of the bronchial nodule was performed.After the procedure, ACTH and cortisol levels dropped and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed complete response to treatment. Clinical conditions progressively improved, and 6 weeks later, the patient underwent middle lobectomy without complications. Histology showed a 0.7-cm ACTH-producing typical bronchial carcinoid tumor.Thermal ablation with radiofrequency allows achieving a rapid control of hypercortisolism with subsequent improvement of symptoms. This procedure should therefore be considered as a viable therapeutic option in those cases of bronchial ACTH-secreting tumors in which the surgical approach is initially contraindicated.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483161","annotations":[{"name":"Ketoconazole","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoconazole"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Cushing's syndrome","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing's_syndrome"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Radiofrequency ablation","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofrequency_ablation"},{"name":"Carcinoid","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoid"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cortisol","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"},{"name":"Adrenocorticotropic hormone","weight":0.787188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocorticotropic_hormone"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.658353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.621046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.573664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Lobectomy","weight":0.543838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobectomy"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.435957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fluorine","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.244282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"}]}
