{"id":66292,"title":"Technical standardization of laparoscopic lymphatic sparing varicocelectomy in children using isosulfan blue.","abstract":"The lymphatic preservation to prevent hydrocele formation after laparoscopic varicocelectomy is essential. Lymphatic sparing procedures using scrotal injection give a rate of mapping failures of 20%-30%. The aim of the present study is to standardize the technique of injection to perform a lymphatic sparing procedure in case of laparoscopic varicocelectomy.We retrospectively evaluated 50 patients who underwent laparoscopic varicocelectomy from July 2010 to July 2013. Patients were divided into two groups: G1 (25 patients) those who underwent a classical isosulfan blue scrotal intra-dartos injection and G2 (25 patients) those who underwent the new standardized isosulfan blue scrotal intra-dartos/intra-testicular injection.In G1 lymphatic vessels were identified as blue coloured in 19/25 of cases (76%), in G2 in 25/25 of cases (100%). The results were analyzed using test ?(2) with Yates' correction and there was a statistically significant difference (?(2)=0.05,1) between G2 and G1. Postoperative hydrocele was noted in 2/6 patients of G1 in whom the lymphatic vessels were not identified.Laparoscopic lymphatic sparing varicocelectomy is an effective procedure to adopt in children with varicocele. The intra-dartos/intra-testicular injection of isosulfan blue is significantly better than the previously described intra-dartos injection, permitting to identify lymphatic vessels in 100% of cases in our series. No allergy to isosulfan blue was reported in both groups.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726132","annotations":[{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Scrotum","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.0378012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hydrocele","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocele"},{"name":"Varicocele","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicocele"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.0217215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Cartography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"2030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"In the Year 2525","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Year_2525"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"The Guardian","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Yates County, New York","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yates_County,_New_York"}]}
