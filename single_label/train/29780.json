{"id":29780,"title":"The effect of heroin dependence on resumption of heroin self-administration in rats.","abstract":"It has been proposed that relapse vulnerability in previously dependent individuals results from augmentation of drug-induced reinforcement due to repeated associations between the interoceptive properties of the drug and reduction of acute withdrawal distress.To test this hypothesis, male Sprague-Dawley rats self-administered 0.05 mg/kg/inf heroin on continuous reinforcement (CR) and progressive ratio (PR) schedules. During this period, they also received injections of vehicle or escalating doses of heroin. Following tests of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, as well as a drug-free period (4 days), and extinction (9 sessions), they were pre-treated with vehicle or yohimbine (0.5mg/kg, IV) and tested for resumption of heroin self-administration (0.05 mg/kg/inf) on CR and PR schedules, or tested for reinstatement in extinction conditions.Increased self-administration on the CR schedule was observed in the heroin-injected rats, but no group differences were observed on the PR schedule, in spite of greater signs of withdrawal precipitated by naloxone in the heroin-injected rats. More importantly, there were no group differences in resumption of heroin self-administration, and this was not altered by yohimbine.These results suggest that relapse vulnerability cannot be uniquely ascribed to enhanced reinforcing action of drugs; contextual and other conditioning factors must play a role in modulating resumption of drug intake after abstinence.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613630","annotations":[{"name":"Naloxone","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone"},{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.773731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.692953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.615169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.551285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.382248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.374442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.373667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.370077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.280229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.204946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Opioid dependence","weight":0.178514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_dependence"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.127776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Extinction","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Yohimbine","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohimbine"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Root of unity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_unity"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Vulnerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Augmentation (psychiatry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentation_(psychiatry)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Progressive rock","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
