{"id":88307,"title":"[Treatment of osteoporosis with PTH].","abstract":"Teriparatide is an only available bone anabolic drug in practice. It is a N-terminal fragment of parathyroid hormone (PTH) . Mode of actions of teriparatide is pharmacological but not physiological as it is administered to patients with osteoporosis. Physicians need to understand the fact that treatment with teriparatide is not just like a hormone replacement. They also should administer teriparatide to their patients after rigorous evaluation of its clinical superiority to other anti-osteoprosis drugs, because it is not classified as a first-line drug.
