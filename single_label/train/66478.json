{"id":66478,"title":"Transplantation. T-cell depletion--balancing acute rejection and cancer risk.","abstract":"The authors of a new study suggest that the proinflammatory state of acute rejection combined with the use of T-cell-depleting antibody therapy might explain the increased risk of cancer after kidney transplantation. However, their findings do not fully support this conclusion; use of T-cell-depleting antibodies alone is likely to increase cancer risk.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709843","annotations":[{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.797086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.672338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibody therapy","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody_therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"}]}
