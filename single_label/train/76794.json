{"id":76794,"title":"Telephonic analysis of the snoring sound spectrum.","abstract":"Snoring is a sound caused by vibration of collapsed and/or unsteady airway walls of the pharynx and soft palate. We compared stored spectra of snoring sounds recorded via cell phone (CP) and a microphone placed over the head (head phone [HP]).Thirty-four snoring patients were included in this prospective study. Groups were identified by reference to body mass index (BMI) values: group 1, BMI < 25 kg/m² (n = 8); group 2, BMI 25 to 29 kg/m² (n = 10); and group 3, BMI ? 30 kg/m² (n = 16). Snoring sounds were recorded using CPs and HPs and digitally analyzed. We identified the frequencies with the highest snoring powers (F(max) values) and snoring sound intensity levels (SSILs).F(max) ranged from 520 to 985 Hz in HP recordings and from 845 to 1645 Hz in CP recordings. Snoring sound intensity level values increased in proportion to BMI and were 6 to 24 dB in HP recordings and 19 to 52 dB in CP recordings. Thus, the CP values of F(max) and SSIL were higher than the HP values. In obese patients of group 3, almost all F(max) and SSIL values were higher than those of groups 1 and 2. In particular, the CP F(max) values were elevated in such patients. The advanced technologies used in modern CPs may allow some snoring sounds in susceptible individuals to be defined as oronasal.Cell phone technology allows snoring to be evaluated in patients located in areas remote from a hospital. To explore the intensity of snoring and to postoperatively monitor the efficacy of surgery used to treat snoring, telephonic sound analysis is both new and effective and reduces the need for patient attendance at a hospital. Those experiencing severe snoring and/or who are obese should be told of what can be done to solve such problems.","date":"2014-10-18","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
