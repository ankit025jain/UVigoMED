{"id":5112,"title":"[Multislice spiral CT diagnosis error analysis of children's airway foreign bodies].","abstract":"Analysis of multislice CT (MSCT) on the misdiagnosis reasons of children bronchial foreign body, avoid missed diagnosis, to achieve reasonable application.Fourteen cases of misdiagnosed cases of data were retrospectively analyzed in our department of suspicious in children with bronchial foreign body, and discuss the misdiagnosis reasons.Fourteen cases of misdiagnosis of children with 9 cases by MSCT examination showed no obvious foreign matter. Through bronchoscopy intraoperative found foreign body, 5 cases by multislice CT (MSCT) to found foreign body, 4 cases of phlegm scabs, 1 case is inflammatory granulation, all recovered after treatment. Reasons of misdiagnosis were threshold selection error, scanning level from the inception glottis, imaging error, etc.MSCT is a very valuable diagnostic on airway foreign body check method, but there are certain limitations, we should improve the understanding of misdiagnosis and reduce the occurrence of this phenomenon.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322608","annotations":[{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.812954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.605914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Phlegm","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlegm"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.259539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.23351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.212383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.187112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Glottis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Checking (ice hockey)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checking_(ice_hockey)"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.0197932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Spiral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Granulation tissue","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulation_tissue"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Error analysis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis"}]}
