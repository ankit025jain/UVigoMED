{"id":72698,"title":"Extracellularly activatable nanocarriers for drug delivery to tumors.","abstract":"Nanoparticles (NPs) for drug delivery to tumors need to satisfy two seemingly conflicting requirements: they should maintain physical and chemical stability during circulation and be able to interact with target cells and release the drug at desired locations with no substantial delay. The unique microenvironment of tumors and externally applied stimuli provide a useful means to maintain a balance between the two requirements.We discuss nanoparticulate drug carriers that maintain stable structures in normal conditions but respond to stimuli for the spatiotemporal control of drug delivery. We first define the desired effects of extracellular activation of NPs and frequently used stimuli and then review the examples of extracellularly activated NPs.Several challenges remain in developing extracellularly activatable NPs. First, some of the stimuli-responsive NPs undergo incremental changes in response to stimuli, losing circulation stability. Second, the applicability of stimuli in clinical settings is limited due to the occasional occurrence of the activating conditions in normal tissues. Third, the construction of stimuli-responsive NPs involves increasing complexity in NP structure and production methods. Future efforts are needed to identify new targeting conditions and increase the contrast between activated and nonactivated NPs while keeping the production methods simple and scalable.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24950343","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.751946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Nanomedicine","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomedicine"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.360251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.220061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.208106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.130186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Standard conditions for temperature and pressure","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Drug carrier","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_carrier"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Aircraft carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Stable isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope"},{"name":"Scalability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Methods of production","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_production"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"NP (complexity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)"},{"name":"Spacetime","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Noun phrase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"}]}
