{"id":85259,"title":"[Imbalance in the expression of Foxp3, T-bet and GATA-3 is correlated with inflammation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].","abstract":"To observe the change of regulatory T cells(Tregs), fork head-like transcription factor 3 (Foxp3), T box expressed in T cells (T-bet) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) in rat models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Thirty rats were randomly divided into control group and model group (n=15 each). The rats of model group were developed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and smoking. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and ?-interferon (IFN-?) in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were detected 28 days after modeling by ELISA. Peripheral Tregs were detected by flow cytometry. The expressions of Foxp3, T-bet, GATA gene and protein in lung tissue were observed by reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting, respectively.Compared with the control group, the model group had more serious inflammation in lung tissues, expressed the higher levels of IFN-? in serum and BALF (P<0.01), T-bet mRNA and protein in lung tissue, and the lower levels of IL-4, CD4? CD25? Treg, CD4? CD25? Foxp3? Treg (P<0.05), Foxp3, GATA-3 mRNA and protein (P<0.01). Correlation analysis showed that there were correlations between T-bet, GATA-3, Foxp3 expressions and IL-4, IFN-? levels (P<0.05).There is a relationship between inflammation and imbalance of in the expression of T-bet, GATA-3, Foxp3 in COPD.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Respiratory Tract
