{"id":87890,"title":"Comorbidity and insurance as predictors of disability after traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"To examine the unique contribution of self-reported medical comorbidity and insurance type on disability after traumatic brain injury (TBI).Inception cohort design at 1-year follow up.A university affiliated rehabilitation hospital.Adults with mild-complicated to severe TBI (N=70).Not applicable.Self-reported medical comorbidities were measured using the Modified Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, while insurance type was classified as commercial or government-funded; disability was measured using the Disability Rating Scale.Two models were run using multiple linear regression, and the best-fitting model was selected on the basis of Bayesian information criterion. The full model, which included self-reported medical comorbidity and insurance type, was significantly better fitting than the reduced model. Participants with a longer duration of posttraumatic amnesia, more self-reported medical comorbidities, and government insurance were more likely to have higher levels of disability. Meanwhile, individual organ systems were not predictive of disability.The cumulative effect of self-reported medical comorbidities and type of insurance coverage predict disability above and beyond well-known prognostic variables. Early assessment of medical complications and improving services provided by government-funded insurance may enhance quality of life and reduce long-term health care costs.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972339","annotations":[{"name":"Disability","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.513748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.510378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.472763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.367372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.350137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.348654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.309884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"University","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Amnesia","weight":0.154061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.151282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Biological system","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.033431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
