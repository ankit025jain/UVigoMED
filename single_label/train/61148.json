{"id":61148,"title":"Ponatinib: a third-generation inhibitor for the treatment of CML.","abstract":"The establishment of imatinib as the standard therapy for CML marked the beginning of a new era of treatment. Due to occurring intolerance and resistance against the drug, developing newer inhibitors was promoted. This led to the second-generation inhibitors dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib. Despite all achieved improvement, all first- and second-generation inhibitors are ineffective against the BCR-ABL T315I \"gatekeeper\" mutation. In order to overcome this issue and to further improve the inhibitory effect, the third-generation inhibitor ponatinib was developed. Various clinical trials have been launched to study the effect of ponatinib in the clinical setting. Based on positive phase 1 and phase 2 trials, ponatinib was approved for the second-line treatment of CML and Ph+ ALL in December 2012 in the United States and in July 2013 in the European Union. Further trials investigate the potential effect of ponatinib in kinase-dependent subgroups of other malignancies. In conclusion, ponatinib has proved to be a powerful BCR-ABL inhibitor, which exhibits clinical activity both in BCR-ABL wild-type and mutant CML, including activity against the T315I mutation. Despite previous TKI failure, chronic-phase CML patients can achieve sustained remissions using the novel drug, offering a new therapeutic option in the treatment for CML.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756787","annotations":[{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.828744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.737028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.681106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.651187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Dasatinib","weight":0.619617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasatinib"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.553642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.544231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nilotinib","weight":0.438373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilotinib"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.413936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.25753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"315","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/315"},{"name":"Ship naming and launching","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_naming_and_launching"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Gatekeeper","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeper"},{"name":"Drug intolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_intolerance"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"}]}
