{"id":90609,"title":"Comparative study in surgical outcome of intracapsular fracture neck of femur in active elderly patients treated with hemiarthroplasty with Austin Moore's and bipolar prosthesis.","abstract":"Fracture neck of femur is most commonly encountered fractures in elderly population. Hemiarthroplasty is generally considered to be the treatment of choice in most active elderly patients. However, there is inadequate evidence to support the choice between unipolar or bipolar prosthesis. This study was conducted to analyze the outcome regarding pain, hip function, complication and acetabular erosion in patients randomly selected and treated with Austin Moore's or Bipolar hemiarthroplasty in our setup. The study included total of 40 patients (17 males and 23 females) with intracapsular neck of femur fractures with mean age of 67 years (55-85 years). 20 patients each were treated with Hemiarthroplasty using Austin Moore's and Bipolar prosthesis. The patients were followed up at intervals of 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 24 weeks and 1 year after the operation and evaluated clinically and radiologically. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding complication. The Harris hip score were 81.95% (SD - 2.99) in Austin Moore's hemiarthroplasty and 79.15% (SD - 2.94) in Bipolar hemiarthroplasty (p = 0.812), whereas acetabular erosion was 20.05% in Austin Moore's hemiarthroplasty and 5% in Bipolar hemiarthroplasty (p = 0.758) with no mortality seen during lyear follow up. The intracapsular neck of femur fracture in active elderly patients treated with Austin Moore's hemiarthroplasty had better outcome regarding pain and hip function whereas high acetabular erosion compared to patients treated with Bipolar hemiarthroplasty though the difference is statistically insignificant.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592803","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.523435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.485979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.445331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.396536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.341581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.325617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.281638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.278298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.171152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.123553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.120719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hemiarthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiarthroplasty"},{"name":"Austin, Texas","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"812","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/812"},{"name":"758","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/758"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Moores","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moores"}]}
