{"id":23681,"title":"Epidemiology of mucormycosis in Europe.","abstract":"Zygomycosis (mucormycosis) is being increasingly recognized as causing infection in recent years. National and multinational European surveys attempting to analyse the epidemiological parameters of this potentially devastating infection are very few. Although the exact incidence could not be defined due to the different methodologies used in these studies and the absence of a denominator, there were some useful observations made regarding the clinical presentation, sites of infection and diagnostic practices. Moreover, the importance for a prompt and accurate diagnosis has been stressed. As early diagnosis can significantly affect the initiation of treatment and decrease mortality, future research should focus on the development of an epidemiological risk assessment tool and novel diagnostic methods.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476100","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.473472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.430036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.406998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.239976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Zygomycosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygomycosis"},{"name":"Mucormycosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucormycosis"},{"name":"Multinational corporation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Division by zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_zero"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
