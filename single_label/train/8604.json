{"id":8604,"title":"Cancer/testis antigen HCA587-derived long peptide vaccine generates potent immunologic responses and antitumor effects in mouse model.","abstract":"The cancer/testis antigen HCA587 (also known as MAGE-C2), one of the most immunogenic tumor antigens, is overexpressed in a wide spectrum of malignant tumors and can serve as a target for immunotherapy. In this study, we synthesized 14 overlapping (25-35 amino acids) long peptides representing the sequence of the most immunogenic part of the HCA587 protein and evaluated the antigen-specific immune responses and antitumor effects generated by immunization with the synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccine in a mouse model. HCA587 SLPs in combination with adjuvants CFA and CpG ODN induced potent T-cell responses, which were dominated by type 1 cytokine IFN-?-producing CD4(+) T cells as measured by ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining assay. Moreover, HCA587 SLP vaccination conferred protection against challenge with HCA587-expressing B16 melanoma in a therapeutic setting. Our findings may provide a scientific basis for the use of HCA587-derived long overlapping peptide vaccine for the treatment of patients with cancer in future clinical trials.
