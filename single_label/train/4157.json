{"id":4157,"title":"Assessment of follicular fluid leptin levels and insulin resistance as outcome predictors in women undergoing in vitro fertilization-intracytoplasmic sperm injection.","abstract":"To analyze follicular fluid leptin (FFL) levels, abdominal obesity, and insulin resistance as predictors of in vitro fertilization (IVF)-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) outcome.Observational study.Academic medical center.A sample of 130 infertile women aged 26-40 years without polycystic ovary syndrome.Measurement of FFL levels in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycles with an antagonist and agonist protocol for IVF-ICSI.Live birth rate.Mean FFL values were significantly higher in pregnancies not ending in a live birth, even after adjustment for waist circumference and insulin resistance. A multivariable model obtained with the use of logistic binary regression analysis showed that waist circumference and insulin resistance had no influence over IVF-ICSI outcomes, but a higher number of follicles, lower serum progesterone levels on the day before ?-hCG administration, and lower FFL concentrations were significantly associated with a higher probability of having a live birth. The multivariate model reached a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 71% for predicting the possibility of pregnancy ending in a live birth.High FFL levels were associated with abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and a lower live birth rate after IVF-ICSI. Further investigations are warranted to define the precise roles of leptin, obesity, and insulin resistance on IVF-ICSI outcomes.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
