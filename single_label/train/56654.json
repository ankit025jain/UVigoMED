{"id":56654,"title":"Matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases in the aqueous humour of patients with primary angle closure glaucoma - a quantitative study.","abstract":"Altered levels of specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in the aqueous humour of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) eyes have been described. In this study, levels of specific MMPs and TIMPs in the aqueous humour of primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) eyes were measured and compared with those of POAG as well as non-glaucoma control eyes.Aqueous humour from 16 PACG, 28 POAG and 27 control eyes were sampled during intraocular surgery. Levels of total protein, MMP-2, MMP-3, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were quantified by protein assay and enzyme immunoassay.Total protein levels were significantly higher in PACG (0.426 ± 0.126 mg/ml, p = 0.043) and POAG (0.578 ± 0.360 mg/ml, p = 0.007) compared to controls (0.292 ± 0.192 mg/ml). The difference between PACG and POAG was not significant (p = 0.158). MMP-2 was significantly higher in PACG (p = 0.032) and POAG (p < 0.001) compared to controls. The difference between PACG and POAG was also not significant (p = 0.133). MMP-3 was significantly higher in POAG compared to controls (p = 0.002) and PACG (p = 0.029). The difference between PACG and controls was not significant (p = 0.962). TIMP-1 was significantly higher in PACG (p = 0.049) and POAG (p = 0.010) compared to controls. The difference between PACG and POAG was also not significant (p = 0.961). TIMP-2 was significantly higher in POAG (p = 0.004) compared to controls. The difference between PACG and either controls or POAG was not significant (p > 0.05). Although not statistically significant (p > 0.05), the MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio was highest in PACG (2.83 ± 7.40), followed by POAG (1.38 ± 1.55) and controls (1.34 ± 3.05). Similarly, the MMP-2/TIMP-1 ratio was highest in PACG (1.50 ± 1.69), followed by POAG (1.40 ± 0.77) and controls (1.15 ± 0.92). The MMP-2 +?MMP-3/TIMP-1 + TIMP-2 ratio was higher in PACG (0.83 ± 0.80) and POAG (0.82 ± 0.53) compared to controls (0.70 ± 0.63). In both POAG and PACG, there were no significant differences in the levels of total protein, MMP-2, MMP-3, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 between patients on prostaglandin analogues and those not.We found altered levels of MMPs and TIMPs as well as imbalance of MMP:TIMP ratios in the aqueous humour of PACG eyes that were different from POAG and non-glaucoma control eyes.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655889","annotations":[{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.89194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.881127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Aqueous humour","weight":0.754085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_humour"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.417759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.340568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.282956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Eye surgery","weight":0.211979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_surgery"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"TIMP2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIMP2"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"961","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/961"},{"name":"962","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/962"},{"name":"Humour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour"},{"name":"292","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/292"},{"name":"578","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/578"},{"name":"Multi-Man Publishing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Man_Publishing"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Altered (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_(film)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 426","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_426"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"MMP3","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP3"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"}]}
