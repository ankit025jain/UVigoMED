{"id":53229,"title":"Association between vaspin rs2236242 gene polymorphism and polycystic ovary syndrome risk.","abstract":"Vaspin, an adipocytokine that has been isolated from the visceral adipose tissue, is a member of the serine protease inhibitor family. In humans, serum vaspin levels are correlated with body mass index (BMI) and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The present study is the first investigation to examine the association between vaspin rs2236242 gene polymorphism and risk of PCOS in Iranian patients. This case-control study was performed on 150 patients with PCOS and 150 healthy women. The vaspin genotypes were determined using tetra-amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (T-ARMS-PCR). Our finding showed that there are significant differences in genotype frequencies between case and control group regarding vaspin rs2236242 polymorphism (OR=0.59, CI=0.37-0.95, p=0.03). The A allele decreased the risk of PCOS (OR=0.67, CI=0.46-0.96, p=0.03) as compared to the T allele. There was no significant association between vaspin rs2236242 gene polymorphism and PCOS after adjusting genotypes for BMI. In conclusion, our data suggest a significant association between vaspin rs2236242 polymorphism and the PCOS but this relationship is affected by obesity status.
