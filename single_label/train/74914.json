{"id":74914,"title":"[Gasserian ganglion block for trigeminal neuralgia under dexmedetomidine sedation].","abstract":"We report a case of successful procedural sedation using dexmedetomidine (DEX) in a 68-year-old woman undergoing left gasserian ganglion block for intractable trigeminal neuralgia. DEX was chosen to provide an effective sedation and clear communication about the injection of drugs or thermocoagulation. After 15 minutes of DEX administration at 0.8 microg x kg(-1) x hr(-1), nerve block needle insertion was bearable. The patient could feel a weakening of the sensation of her left maxilla and mandible after receiving a 0.4 ml mepivacaine test dose. High-frequency thermocoagulation elicited tolerable radiating pain with minimum vital sign change. She was comfortable and had no communication difficulty under DEX sedation. DEX sedation for interventional pain management during procedures such as gasserian ganglion block may be useful.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25199328","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.632776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Trigeminal nerve","weight":0.562359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_nerve"},{"name":"Trigeminal ganglion","weight":0.520754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_ganglion"},{"name":"Neuralgia","weight":0.475955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralgia"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.303213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Trigeminal neuralgia","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_neuralgia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.170177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Nerve block","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_block"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.081755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Procedural sedation and analgesia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_sedation_and_analgesia"},{"name":"Hr1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hr1"},{"name":"Mepivacaine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mepivacaine"},{"name":"Dexmedetomidine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexmedetomidine"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Procedural programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Vital signs","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"}]}
