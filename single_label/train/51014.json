{"id":51014,"title":"Practical treatment using mitotane for adrenocortical carcinoma.","abstract":"Description of novel findings about the mechanism of action of mitotane and its activity as an adjunctive postoperative measure, or for treatment of advanced adrenocortical carcinoma.Several in-vitro studies have shown that mitotane suppresses gene transcription of different enzymatic steps of the steroidogenetic pathway. Moreover, mitotane induces CYP3A4 expression, thus accelerating the metabolic clearance of a variety of drugs including steroids. Retrospective studies provided evidence that adjunctive mitotane can prolong recurrence-free survival of treated patients. The concept of a therapeutic window of mitotane plasma concentrations was confirmed also for adjunctive treatment, but the relationship between mitotane concentration and given dose is loose. Genetic variability of the P450-dependent enzymes metabolizing mitotane may explain individual differences.Mitotane concentration of 14-20 ?mg/l should be reached and maintained during treatment also in an adjunctive setting. In advanced adrenocortical carcinoma, a high-dose starting regimen should be employed when mitotane is used as monotherapy. The combination of mitotane with other drugs should consider the possibility of pharmacologic interactions due to mitotane-induced activation of drug metabolism. This concept applies also to steroid replacement in mitotane-treated patients, who need higher doses to adjust for increased steroid metabolism.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732405","annotations":[{"name":"CYP3A4","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.875996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.754147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.715845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.709894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.674244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.663822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.638739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Adrenal cortex","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_cortex"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Therapeutic window","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_window"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.409539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.387952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Genetic variability","weight":0.333672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variability"},{"name":"Grapefruit drug interactions","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapefruit_drug_interactions"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.079746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Adrenocortical carcinoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocortical_carcinoma"},{"name":"Mitotane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitotane"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"List of grape varieties","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_grape_varieties"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
