{"id":72206,"title":"MicroRNA-32 inhibits osteosarcoma cell proliferation and invasion by targeting Sox9.","abstract":"Increasing reports suggest that discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) might provide a novel therapeutical target for human cancers, including osteosarcoma. Previous studies have shown that miR-32 was dysregulated in breast and endometrial cancer. However, its biological roles in osteosarcoma remain unclear. In the current study, we found that miR-32 was significantly down-regulated in osteosarcoma tissues, compared with the adjacent normal tissues. In vitro studies further demonstrated that miR-32 mimics were able to suppress, while its antisense oligos promoted cell proliferation in Saos-2 and U2OS cells. At the molecular level, our data further revealed that expression of Sox9 was negatively regulated by miR-32. Therefore, our results identify an important role for miR-32 in the osteosarcoma through regulating Sox9 expression.","date":"2014-10-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24989927","annotations":[{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.691716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Sense (molecular biology)","weight":0.564844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Oligonucleotide","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligonucleotide"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"}]}
