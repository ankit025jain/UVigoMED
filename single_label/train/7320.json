{"id":7320,"title":"Magnetic resonance imaging in the tibial epiphyseal growth plate development of Wistar rat.","abstract":"This research aims to investigate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the tibial epiphyseal growth plate development of Wistar rat.Fifty weanling Wistar rats were divided by a computerized blocking procedure into five groups. The rats received standard commercial feed with or without T-2 toxin additive, low-protein feed with or without T-2 toxin additive, and Kashin-Beck disease (KBD)-affected feed.Compared with the control group rat, MRI showed localized epiphyseal plate swelling, rough appearance, and uneven signal on the tibia of rats fed with KBD-affected feed. Histology confirmed the epiphyseal plate degeneration seen by MRI, and the degenerative changes were characterized by abnormal distribution of chondrocytes with loss and clustering, cartilage fragmentation, and erosion in group E.The MR image of the rat epiphyseal plate is altered in the KBD model rats, and epiphyseal plate MRI appearance has been reproduced by using T-2 toxin and KBD-affected feed of epidemic district.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885056","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.828188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.711178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.694828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.55516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.474585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.246549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Epiphyseal plate","weight":0.219746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyseal_plate"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.16379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Chondrocyte","weight":0.13109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrocyte"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"T-2 mycotoxin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-2_mycotoxin"},{"name":"Wistar rat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wistar_rat"},{"name":"Weanling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weanling"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Barrel (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Compound feed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_feed"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Epiphysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphysis"},{"name":"Advertising","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group E","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2008_qualifying_Group_E"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"}]}
