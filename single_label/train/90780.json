{"id":90780,"title":"[Prediction by early change of bone metabolic markers of the efficacy of anti-osteoporotic drugs on bone mass in osteoporotic patients].","abstract":"The importance of measurement of bone metabolic markers has been increasingly recognized in the treatment of osteoporosis. Bone is a dynamic organ in which bone formation and resorption continuously occurs. Biochemical marker for bone metabolism is an non-invasive measure to assess bone metabolic state. Although the purpose of its measurement was initially hypothesized to predict rate of bone loss, the increase of bone marker by itself provides a clinically relevant marker for bone fragility. Furthermore, measurement of bone marker is known to help improve drug compliance. Recent sophistication of bone marker measurement and the increasing kinds of bone markers increase the importance of its measurement to improve osteoporosis treatment.
