{"id":81105,"title":"Vaccination with Leishmania mexicana LPG induces PD-1 in CD8? and PD-L2 in macrophages thereby suppressing the immune response: a model to assess vaccine efficacy.","abstract":"Leishmania lipophosphoglycan (LPG) is a molecule that has been used as a vaccine candidate, with contradictory results. Since unsuccessful protection could be related to suppressed T cell responses, we analyzed the expression of inhibitory receptor PD-1 in CD8(+) and CD4(+) lymphocytes and it is ligand PD-L2 in macrophages of BALB/c mice immunized with various doses of Leishmania mexicana LPG and re-stimulated in vitro with different concentrations of LPG. Vaccination with LPG enhanced the expression of PD-1 in CD8(+) cells. Activation molecules CD137 were reduced in CD8(+) cells from vaccinated mice. In vitro re-stimulation enhanced PD-L2 expression in macrophages of healthy mice in a dose-dependent fashion. The expression of PD-1, PD-L2 and CD137 is modulated according to the amount of LPG used during immunization and in vitro re-stimulation. We analyzed the expression of these molecules in mice infected with 1×10(4) or 1×10(5)L. mexicana promastigotes and re-stimulated in vitro with LPG. Infection with 1×10(5) parasites increased the PD-1 expression in CD8(+) and diminished PD-L2 in macrophages. When these CD8(+) cells were re-stimulated in vitro with LPG, simulating a second exposure to parasite antigens, PD-1 expression increased significantly more, in a dose dependent fashion. We conclude that CD8(+) T lymphocytes and macrophages express inhibition molecules according to the concentrations of Leishmania LPG and to the parasite load. Vaccination with increased amounts of LPG or infections with higher parasite numbers induces enhanced expression of PD-1 and functional inactivation of CD8(+) cells, which can have critical consequences in leishmaniasis, since these cells are crucial for disease control. These results call for pre-vaccination evaluations of potential immunogens, specifically where CD8 cells are required, since inhibiting molecules can be induced after certain thresholds of antigen concentrations. We propose that the analysis of PD-1 and PD-L2 are useful tools to monitor the optimal dose for vaccination candidates.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462405","annotations":[{"name":"Leishmania","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.827917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.818972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.633128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.580041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.540191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.461651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.459765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Promastigote","weight":0.025403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promastigote"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
