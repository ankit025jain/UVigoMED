{"id":52897,"title":"Candidate agents for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma identified by a sub-pathway based method.","abstract":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. This study aims to explore the molecular mechanism of PDAC and identify biologically active small molecules capable of targeting the sub-pathways which were dysregulated in the development of PDAC.The gene expression profile of GSE28735 microarray data (including 45 matching pairs of pancreatic tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues) was downloaded from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pancreatic tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues were identified, and then the sub-pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Moreover, an approach based on targeting sub-pathways was used to reveal potential agents for PDAC.A total of 5315 DEGs were identified between pancreatic tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues with a false discovery rate of 0.01. Genes of collagen family and integrin receptor family which were involved in pathways of focal adhesion and ECM-receptor interaction respectively were differentially expressed in the pancreatic tumor tissue. Besides, a total of 85 small molecules including fludrocortisone, latamoxef and metronidazole were revealed by bioinformatics analysis.This study proposed the use of an approach based on targeting sub-pathways to identify potential agents for PDAC. The sub-pathways and small molecules discovered in this study were not only related to PDAC but also play a role in perturbing the development of PDAC.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561286","annotations":[{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Metronidazole","weight":0.880674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronidazole"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.802046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.745354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.703039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.670807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.631202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.510716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.417965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Focal adhesion","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_adhesion"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.248654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Small molecule","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_molecule"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Fludrocortisone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludrocortisone"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Isotope separation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope_separation"},{"name":"Uploading and downloading","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uploading_and_downloading"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery-MacLeod-McCarty_experiment"}]}
