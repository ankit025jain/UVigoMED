{"id":90216,"title":"Mechanical advantages of a truss-structure-based fracture fixation system--a novel fracture fixation device \"PinFix\".","abstract":"A small, light, ball-joint device called PinFix, which can instantly convert a simple percutaneous cross pin fracture fixation system into a rigid external fracture fixation system based on truss structure, was developed. The purpose of this study was to compare the mechanical load and breaking strength of this truss-structure-based fixation system to that of the conventionally used external cantilever structure-based fixation system. Three types of mechanical loading tests, axial, bending, and torsion, were performed on an artificial fractured bone treated with either three-dimensional PinFix fixation, two-dimensional PinFix fixation, or conventional external fixation. The three- and two-dimensional PinFix fixations showed significantly more stiffness than conventional fixation on all three loading tests. Finite element analysis was next performed to calculate the stress distribution of the parts in PinFix and in the conventional fixator. The applied stress to the rod and connectors of PinFix was much less than that of the conventional external fixator. These results reflected the physical characteristic of truss structure in which applied load is converted to pure tension or compression forces along the members of the PinFix. In conclusion, PinFix is a simple fracture fixation system that has a truss-structure with a high rigidity.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640174","annotations":[{"name":"Finite element method","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.692794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Torsion (mechanics)","weight":0.688959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Structural load","weight":0.64932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_load"},{"name":"Bending","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.635388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Cantilever","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantilever"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.571275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Truss","weight":0.562853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truss"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.441905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.255345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.183484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0474058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Fishing rod","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_rod"},{"name":"Electrical connector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_connector"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Systema","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema"},{"name":"Integrated Truss Structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Truss_Structure"},{"name":"Fixation (visual)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(visual)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"}]}
