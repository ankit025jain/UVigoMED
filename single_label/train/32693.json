{"id":32693,"title":"[Improvement of outcomes in the surgical treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) with staged Norwood operation].","abstract":"On behalf of rapid progress of diagnostic technologies and new development of surgical technique or strategy, outcomes of surgical treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) has remarkably improved in the current practice. One of such approaches is the staged Norwood operation. We have reviewed our patients (n=54) between 2003 and 2013. A half of the patients with the staged group accomplished Norwood procedure and concomitant bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt at the mean age of 4 months old. An another half of the patients underwent secondary Norwood operation with Blalock-Taussig( BT) shunt or right-ventricle to pulmonary artery( RV-PA) conduit, because of ductal closure in spite of prostaglandin, or progressive reversed coarctation. Cardiac catheterization showed good results in both the primary (n=17) and the staged approach (n=37), partly because even in the primary Norwood group we used a smaller calibered graft for BT shunt or RV-PA conduit to unload the ventricle as much as possible. In conclusion, since the surgical mortality of staged group was superior to that of the primary group and the mid-term survival in the staged seemed to be better than that of primary, we would pursue our strategy of the staged approach in the surgical treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
