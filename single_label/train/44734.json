{"id":44734,"title":"A flexible-arm liver retractor that provides an optimal surgical field without postoperative liver dysfunction.","abstract":"It is important to retract the lateral liver segment during laparoscopic gastrectomy to achieve an optimal surgical field. Few retractors cause transient liver dysfunction after surgery; therefore, for an easier and safer procedure, we devised a new liver retractor and implemented a trial clinical application.The novel liver retractor comprises a metallic, flexible arm retractor attached to the operating table and an air compressor which pneumatically moves and fixes the retractor. It was inserted directly into the abdominal cavity just below the xiphisternum to retract the left lobe of the liver anterosuperiorly, thereby exposing the hiatus. Blood samples were collected from the patients on days 1, 3, and 7 after surgery to assess the levels of the liver enzymes AST and ALT.During laparoscopic gastrectomy, no liver damage was observed macroscopically. The surgical fields obtained were optimal and efficient for laparoscopic surgery. Notably, it was possible to retract the liver as often as needed. Further, none of the patients developed postoperative liver dysfunction.The novel flexible-arm retractor provided an optimal surgical field without inducing liver dysfunction.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719943","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.78153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.741106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.602327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.597707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Abdominal cavity","weight":0.562234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_cavity"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Xiphoid process","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiphoid_process"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.457677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.218742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.161224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Air compressor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_compressor"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Pneumatics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Gas compressor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_compressor"},{"name":"Deformation retract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_retract"},{"name":"Retractor (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retractor_(medical)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Left lobe of liver","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_lobe_of_liver"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
