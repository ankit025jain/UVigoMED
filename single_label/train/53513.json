{"id":53513,"title":"Nonalcoholic Fatty liver disease is associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness only in type 2 diabetic subjects with insulin resistance.","abstract":"The association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and subclinical atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes is controversial.The objective of the study was to investigate the participation of insulin resistance in the association of NAFLD and the carotid atherosclerotic burden in a large cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes.This was an observational study performed in 4437 consecutively enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes.Hepatic steatosis and mean carotid intima-media thickness (C-IMT) were measured using ultrasonography. Insulin resistance was assessed using the short insulin tolerance test.The prevalence of NAFLD was 72.7% in the whole study population. Among subjects with NAFLD, 23.2% were not insulin resistant. There were significant differences in C-IMT and the frequency of carotid atherosclerosis between groups classified by insulin resistance within the same NAFLD strata. C-IMT was highest in subjects with both NAFLD and insulin resistance [0.844 ± 0.004 (mean ± SE) mm vs 0.786 ± 0.008, 0.821 ± 0.007, and 0.807 ± 0.006 mm, P for trend <.001, respectively, in insulin sensitive subjects without NAFLD, insulin resistant subjects without NAFLD, and insulin sensitive subjects with NAFLD]. These differences remained after adjusting for potential confounders. However, C-IMT in subjects having only NAFLD or insulin resistance was not higher than that in those with neither NAFLD nor insulin resistance.NAFLD is very common in subjects with type 2 diabetes, but NAFLD not accompanied by insulin resistance is not associated with a carotid atherosclerotic burden. However, having both NAFLD and insulin resistance seemed to be an independent predictor of increased C-IMT.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24512497","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.910318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.738373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.671246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.502722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.203316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.154924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Insulin tolerance test","weight":0.124118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.0255241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
