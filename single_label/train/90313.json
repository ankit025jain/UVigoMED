{"id":90313,"title":"Technical note: How to spare the pronator quadratus during MIPO of distal radius fractures by using a mini-volar plate.","abstract":"Few surgical approaches have been described that spare the pronator quadratus (PQ) during the treatment of distal radius fractures. The PQ supplies blood to the distal radial epiphysis, helps stabilize the distal radio-ulnar joint, and contributes 21% of pronation strength. Sparing the PQ should result in faster bone union and shorter recovery time. To achieve these goals, we currently use a minimally-invasive volar procedure using a specially-designed short plate (APTUS Wrist 2.5 XS, Medartis(Â©)). A 20mm incision is made over the fracture line as described by Henry. The PQ is dissected and then detached from the volar side of the radius. Forceps are used to slide the plate under the muscle. The screws are locked after carefully elevating the distal edge of the PQ. A preliminary study of distal radius fracture fixation by this technique was performed in 31 patients. The scar was 26mm in length and the duration of surgery was 34minutes on average. Patients wore a removable brace for 15 days, and passive wrist motion without loading was allowed during the first week. Functional recovery was faster than seen in previously published series. An average Quick DASH score of 10 was achieved by the 10th post-operative week. Although there are no contraindications to this technique, the quality of the reduction is more important than the scar size and desire to spare the PQ. Never hesitate to convert the incision to a classical Henry approach if technical difficulties arise. Our technique seems best suited to patients with high functional demands. It is currently being evaluated in a prospective series.
