{"id":67792,"title":"Rsf-1 overexpression in human prostate cancer, implication as a prognostic marker.","abstract":"Rsf-1 (HBXAP) was recently reported to be overexpressed in various cancers and associated with the malignant behavior of cancer cells. However, the expression of Rsf-1 and its clinical significance in human prostate cancer have not been reported. In the present study, we analyzed the expression pattern of Rsf-1 in human prostate cancer tissues and found that Rsf-1 was overexpressed in 45 % of prostate cancer specimens. There was a significant association between Rsf-1 overexpression and tumor stage (p=0.0039) and preoperative PSA level (p=0.015). Furthermore, Rsf-1 overexpression correlated with poor biomedical recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer patients (p<0.001). Rsf-1 overexpression could serve as an independent predictor for poor recurrence-free survival (p=0.012). In addition, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown in DU145 cells with high endogenous Rsf-1 expression decrease cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion. In conclusion, Rsf-1 is overexpressed in human prostate cancers and serves as a novel prognostic marker. Rsf-1 contributes to prostate cancer cell growth and invasion, which makes it a candidate therapeutic target.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584698","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.848983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.658461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.36041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"DU145","weight":0.217756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DU145"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0337886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Duke University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"}]}
