{"id":90164,"title":"Exploring portable negative pressure wound therapy devices in the community.","abstract":"Case studies and clinical reviews support the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for managing a range of wound types, yet very few scientific studies fully support its effectiveness. However, it has been argued that NPWT can provide excellent symptom management, reduce the frequency of dressing changes and provide a cost-effective alternative to traditional wound therapies due to faster healing times, leading to a reduction in overall treatment costs. Use of NPWT within community environments is increasing as length of hospital in-patient stay decreases, and many patients who would have traditionally been admitted to an acute setting with a complex or highly exuding wound are now managed by community nurses. This article presents a narrative review of NPWT, identifies safety precautions that require consideration and explores the application of smaller/disposable NPWT systems that are now available.
