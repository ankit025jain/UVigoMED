{"id":65281,"title":"[Dose-dependent effect of atorvastatin on erectile function and androgen status in men with high cardiovascular risk].","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of three different doses of atorvastatin on erectile function and androgen status in men with high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In an open randomized comparative study with parallel groups of 24 weeks were included 100 men aged 40 to 59 years with high risk of CVD, dyslipidemia and metabolic disorders. All patients underwent measurement of blood pressure, anthropometric and biochemical parameters: total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL). Erectile function was assessed using a questionnaire of the International Index of Erectile Function. Study of androgen status included clinical evaluation of androgen deficiency using the standard international questionnaire \"Questionnaire symptoms age men.\"All study participants were randomly assigned to 4 groups: group 1 (n = 28) was treated with atorvastatin 10 mg, group 2--I (n = 27)--20 mg, group 3 (n = 28)--40 mg/day and 4th control group (n = 30) did not receive atorvastatin. Patients were assessed and examined after 1, 3 and 6 months. The therapy indicated a dose-dependent decrease in the levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. In all cases, the concentration of HDL cholesterol increased by an average of 10%. Increasing the dose of atorvastatin was associated with a more pronounced reduction in triglycerides in the blood. Lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin at higher doses has been associated with a slight (8%), but statistically significant decrease in androgen erectile function and status (10%) of the male reproductive age with a high risk of developing CVD. Concluded that the dose of atorvastatin should be individualized according to the level of total cardiovascular risk. With increasing doses of atorvastatin its metabolic effects must be considered and in patients with high risk of developing CVD and with some comorbidities (carbohydrate metabolism disorders, erectile dysfunction).","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Male Urogenital
