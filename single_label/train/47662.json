{"id":47662,"title":"Bronchoscopic finding determined outcome after chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer patients with airway invasion.","abstract":"We studied whether the bronchoscopic findings could be help to predict outcome after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with airway invasion by esophageal cancer.Between 2000 and 2010, we retrospectively investigated esophageal cancer patients with T4 disease due to airway invasion who had received CRT as first line treatment. Airway invasion is defined as infiltration of the tracheobronchial wall or protruded intraluminal growth on bronchoscopy. The total radiation dose of CRT was 60?Gy and divided into two cycles. Bronchoscopic findings were evaluated together with other clinical parameters and correlated with overall survival (OS).There were 68 patients with a mean age of 54.5 years. After the first cycle of CRT, bronchoscopic examination showed complete regression of endobronchial lesion in 16 patients. OS was 26% at 1 year and 5% at 3 years with the median survival time (MST) of 7 months. Multivariate analysis revealed vocal cord palsy (unfavorable, OR [95% CI]:2 [1.07-3.84], P?=?0.03), carina involvement (unfavorable, OR [95% CI]:2.6 [1.12-6], P?=?0.025) and intraluminal tumor growth (unfavorable, OR [95% CI]:1.9 [1.1-3.3], P?=?0.023) as independent factors for survival. The MST after CRT was 12.1, 6.1, 5.7 months in patients with 0, 1, 2 factors, respectively (P?<?0.001).Bronchoscopic finding determined outcome after CRT in esophageal cancer patients with airway invasion.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Digestive System
