{"id":69530,"title":"[Flexible approach to the appointment of solifenacin: for whom and when?].","abstract":"Solifenacin at a dose of 5 mg per day has demonstrated the high efficacy in the treatment of patients with overactive bladder. However, for patients who remained dissatisfied with the outcome of treatment, the dose may be increased to 10. mg per day, which leads to the improvement of patient's condition. However, there is an opinion that treatment should be started with the use of high doses of the drug. Efficiency of solifenacin at a dose of 10 mg was accompanied by favorable safety and tolerability profile. Despite the fact that numerous studies have shown that the clinical efficacy of different anticholinergics is not very different from one another, it is known that patients may prefer some other drugs. Application of solifenacin in these patients leads to significant improvement in quality of life. Thus, flexible approach to the use of solifenacin allows to achieve the best results in the treatment of patients, including those cases where the initial treatment is not effective or is interrupted due to pronounced side effects.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437250","annotations":[{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Anticholinergic","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticholinergic"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.661372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.442761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Overactive bladder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladder"},{"name":"Efficiency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency"}]}
