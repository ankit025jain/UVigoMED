{"id":7440,"title":"The role of the mosquito in a dengue human infection model.","abstract":"Recent efforts to combat the growing global threat of dengue disease, including deployment of phase IIb vaccine trials, has continued to be hindered by uncertainty surrounding equitable immune responses of serotypes, relative viral fitness of vaccine vs naturally occurring strains, and the importance of altered immune environments due to natural delivery routes. Human infection models can significantly improve our understanding of the importance of certain phenotypic characteristics of viral strains, and inform strain selection and trial design. With human models, we can further assess the importance of the natural delivery route of DENV and/or the accompanying mosquito salivary milieu. Accordingly, we discuss the use of mosquitoes in such a human infection model with DENV, identify important considerations, and make preliminary recommendations for deployment of such a mosquito improved DENV human infection model (miDHIM).","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872400","annotations":[{"name":"Mosquito","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito"},{"name":"Fitness (biology)","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.772433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.731933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.705498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Combat","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Denver Gold","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Gold"},{"name":"Uncertainty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Equity (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(law)"},{"name":"Vaccine trial","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_trial"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
