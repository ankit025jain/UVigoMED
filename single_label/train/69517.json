{"id":69517,"title":"Overactive bladder symptom score to evaluate efficacy of solifenacin for the treatment of overactive bladder symptoms.","abstract":"Overactive bladder (OAB) is a series of symptoms with high prevalence in elderly people. This study was conducted using the overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) to evaluate the efficacy of solifenacin succinate for the treatment of OAB.This was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, 12-week study that enrolled 241 OAB patients. The patients received 5-10 mg/day solifenacin. Changes in OABSS, symptoms from voiding diary, perception of bladder condition (PPBC) score, international prostate symptom score (IPSS) and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated at weeks 0, 4, and 12. The relationship between OABSS and PPBC score or parameters of voiding diary was also evaluated.At baseline, the mean OABSS for all patients was 9.41 Â± 2.40, and was reduced significantly at week 12 (-3.76 points; 61.21%, P < 0.0001). The OABSS subscore, PPBC score, IPSS, and QOL were also significantly reduced during the study (P < 0.0001). The overall incidence of adverse events was 19.91% (44 cases). The gastrointestinal system was the most commonly affected (11.31%). Around 5.88% of the cases had adverse events related to the genitourinary system. There was a strong correlation between OABSS and urinary symptoms that was recorded in the 3-day voiding dairy.We showed that solifenacin was clinically effective for relieving OAB symptoms, considering the balance between efficacy, patients' well-being, and tolerability. OABSS integrates four OAB symptoms into a single score and can be a useful tool for research and clinical practice.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438613","annotations":[{"name":"Genitourinary system","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.748002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.633582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.605208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.596789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.233214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.186487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"Solifenacin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solifenacin"},{"name":"Overactive bladder","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladder"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"241","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/241"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Order of Attorneys of Brazil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Attorneys_of_Brazil"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Diary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"Dairy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"2011 Premier League Darts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Premier_League_Darts"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
