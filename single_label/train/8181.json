{"id":8181,"title":"Naringin protects the nigrostriatal dopaminergic projection through induction of GDNF in a neurotoxin model of Parkinson's disease.","abstract":"This study investigated the effect of naringin, a major flavonoid in grapefruit and citrus fruits, on the degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DA) projection in a neurotoxin model of Parkinson's disease (PD) in vivo and the potential underlying mechanisms focusing on the induction of glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), well known as an important neurotrophic factor involved in the survival of adult DA neurons. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) was unilaterally injected into the medial forebrain bundle of rat brains for a neurotoxin model of PD in the presence or absence of naringin by daily intraperitoneal injection. To ascertain whether naringin-induced GDNF contributes to neuroprotection, we further investigated the effects of intranigral injection of neutralizing antibodies against GDNF in the MPP(+) rat model of PD. Our observations demonstrate that naringin could increase the level of GDNF in DA neurons, contributing to neuroprotection in the MPP(+) rat model of PD, with activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. Moreover, naringin could attenuate the level of tumor necrosis factor-? in microglia increased by MPP(+)-induced neurotoxicity in the substantia nigra. These results indicate that naringin could impart to DA neurons the important ability to produce GDNF as a therapeutic agent against PD with anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting that naringin is a beneficial natural product for the prevention of DA degeneration in the adult brain.
