{"id":75215,"title":"[Therapeutic effect of endoscopic third ventriculostomy for pediatric hydrocephalus].","abstract":"To validate the proposed endoscopic third ventriculostomy success score (ETVSS) for predicting successful ETV outcomes for pediatric hydrocephalus on the basis of individual characteristics.For 121 cases at our department from June 2007 to June 2010 at both 6 and 24 months, Actual successful rates were compared with Chi-square test and 95% confidence interval for low, moderate and high chance of success strata based on the ETVSS. Long-term successful probability was calculated with Kaplan-Meier methods.The 6-month ETV successful rate was higher than the mean predicted probabilities of success for both moderate and low success strata, but slightly lower for the high chance of success strata. The ETVSS accurately predicted the outcomes at 24 months; the low, medium and high chance of success strata had actual success rates of 74% (37/50), 62% (28/45) and 41% (11/26) and mean predicted successful probabilities of 81.3%, 61.4% and 34.4% respectively.ETVSS may accurately predict the overall long-term successful rates in high, moderate and low-risk groups. Thus it will aid clinical decision-making through predicting the therapeutic effect of ETV.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25142856","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.687934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Hydrocephalus","weight":0.282569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.131926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Ventriculostomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventriculostomy"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"1126","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1126"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"Eesti Televisioon","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eesti_Televisioon"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
