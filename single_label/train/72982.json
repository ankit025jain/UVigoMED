{"id":72982,"title":"An innovative system for 3D clinical photography in the resource-limited settings.","abstract":"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most frequently occurring cancer in Mozambique among men and the second most frequently occurring cancer among women. Effective therapeutic treatments for KS are poorly understood in this area. There is an unmet need to develop a simple but accurate tool for improved monitoring and diagnosis in a resource-limited setting. Standardized clinical photographs have been considered to be an essential part of the evaluation.When a therapeutic response is achieved, nodular KS often exhibits a reduction of the thickness without a change in the base area of the lesion. To evaluate the vertical space along with other characters of a KS lesion, we have created an innovative imaging system with a consumer light-field camera attached to a miniature \"photography studio\" adaptor. The image file can be further processed by computational methods for quantification.With this novel imaging system, each high-quality 3D image was consistently obtained with a single camera shot at bedside by minimally trained personnel. After computational processing, all-focused photos and measurable 3D parameters were obtained. More than 80 KS image sets were processed in a semi-automated fashion.In this proof-of-concept study, the feasibility to use a simple, low-cost and user-friendly system has been established for future clinical study to monitor KS therapeutic response. This 3D imaging system can be also applied to obtain standardized clinical photographs for other diseases.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24929434","annotations":[{"name":"Photography","weight":0.646494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.518773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.491438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Camera","weight":0.480205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.362483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.324502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.310135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.289574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.25322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stereoscopy","weight":0.252428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.121605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Computer monitor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Computer file","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Mozambique","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Kansas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Disk image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_image"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Image file formats","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Food processing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_processing"},{"name":"Studio","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio"}]}
