{"id":23899,"title":"Ceftriaxone-induced pseudolithiasis in children treated for perforated appendicitis.","abstract":"Ceftriaxone has been associated with development of pseudolithiasis. In our institution, it is used for treatment of perforated appendicitis in children. This study evaluated the occurrence of ceftriaxone-related pseudolithiasis in this population.After obtaining IRB approval, we performed a retrospective chart review over 51 months. We included patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. All patients were treated with ceftriaxone post-operatively. Patients without initial or post-treatment gallbladder imaging available for review were excluded.There were 71 patients who met inclusion criteria with a mean (±SD) age of 10.8 ± 3.8 years. Of these, 14 % (n = 10) developed stones or sludge in the gallbladder. The mean duration of ceftriaxone therapy was 8.7 ± 3.8 days. The average time to post-antibiotic imaging was 11.5 ± 10.3 days from initiation of antibiotics. There was no significant difference in duration of ceftriaxone therapy in the children that developed pseudolithiasis or sludge (10.0 ± 4.9 days) compared to those that did not (8.5 ± 3.6, p = 0.26). One child (10 %) with pseudolithiasis went on to become symptomatic, requiring a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.In our experience, ceftriaxone use for perforated appendicitis is associated with a significant incidence of biliary pseudolithiasis, and is unrelated to duration of ceftriaxone therapy.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464035","annotations":[{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Ceftriaxone","weight":0.800148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftriaxone"},{"name":"Appendicitis","weight":0.795066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.731065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.671518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.459674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Appendectomy","weight":0.262122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendectomy"},{"name":"Gallbladder cancer","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder_cancer"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Sludge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sludge"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"}]}
