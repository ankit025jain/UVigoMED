{"id":45347,"title":"Multi-visceral resection of locally advanced extra-pancreatic carcinoma.","abstract":"Multi-visceral resection for extra-pancreatic carcinoma is an uncommon procedure that may offer palliation and potential cure but must be balanced against the risk for morbidity and mortality.A retrospective analysis was made of patients who had undergone multi-visceral resection of non-pancreatic carcinoma. Factors influencing this procedure included histology, pathologic confirmation of pancreaticoduodenal invasion, tumor clearance, peri-operative morbidity and outcome.Sixteen patients had en bloc resection including a Whipple procedure (6 patients) and a distal resection (10). Primary pathology mostly originated from the stomach and adenocarcinoma was predominately histological. An R0 resection was made in 13 patients, and actual cancer invasion or abutment into the pancreas or duodenum was confirmed pathologically in 11 patients. Twelve patients suffered from at least one complication. Ten patients required therapeutic intervention for complications. There were 2 in-hospital deaths. The median survival of deceased patients was 7.5 months. Six patients are alive at a median of 21 months, and 4 patients have no evidence of disease to the present.Multi-visceral resections for extra-pancreatic carcinoma are associated with substantial morbidity that requires therapeutic intervention. Clinical determination of pancreaticoduodenal abutment and achievement of tumor clearance is excellent. Survival with and without recurrent disease is often limited, supporting that it is necessary to cautiously perform the aggressive procedures in consideration of neoadjuvant therapy.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686548","annotations":[{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.760797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.726011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.718209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.57573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.530904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.512631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.507193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.323784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
