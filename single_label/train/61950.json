{"id":61950,"title":"Non-infectious cryoglobulinemia vasculitis (CryoVas): update on clinical and therapeutic approach.","abstract":"CryoVas is a small vessel vasculitis associated with the presence of circulating cryoglobulins. In the absence of HCV infection, several disorders have been identified in association of CryoVas. Although evidence is limited, a few studies have recently described the clinical presentation, prognosis, and therapeutic management of non-infectious CryoVas. Patients with type I CryoVas, especially associated with hematologic malignancies, have shown a worse clinical presentation. Recent studies have also identified prognostic factors in mixed CryoVas. Therapeutic management in non-infectious CryoVas remains to be defined. Overall, treatment options should be individualized based on severity of involvement. In this setting, new data have emerged regarding the role of biologic therapy in non-infectious CryoVas. Off-label use of rituximab should be highlighted, based on the assessment of benefits and risks, especially infections.
