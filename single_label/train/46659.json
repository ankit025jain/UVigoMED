{"id":46659,"title":"Inhibition of mTOR pathway attenuates migration and invasion of gallbladder cancer via EMT inhibition.","abstract":"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is an aggressive disease in which epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role. Whether inhibition of mTOR effects via EMT reversal in GBC remains unclear. Using genetic and pharmacologic inhibitions of mTOR, we investigated the changes of EMT levels in GBC cells. Expressions of EMT related genes were also studied. Migration and invasion assays were carried out and in vivo tumour metastasis mouse models were established. Circulating tumour DNA was quantified. We used EMT index (ratio of Vimentin/Ecadherin expression) to profile EMT levels. We found that inhibition of mTOR using shRNAs and rapamycin inhibited EMT in GBC-SD gallbladder cancer cells. Inhibition of mTOR inhibited EMT in GBC-SD cells in TGF-?-dependent manner, which was contributed majorly by mTORC2 inhibition. Rapamycin decreased invasiveness and migration of GBC-SD cells in vitro and in vivo. We have in the current study shown that rapamycin diminishes the ability of invasion and migration of GBC via inhibition of TGF-?-dependent EMT. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the carcinogenesis of GBC.
