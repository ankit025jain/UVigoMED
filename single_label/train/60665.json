{"id":60665,"title":"Eribulin mesylate in the management of metastatic breast cancer and other solid cancers: a drug review.","abstract":"In the new era of 'precision' cancer medicine, new drug development has shifted from cytotoxic chemotherapy to molecularly targeted agents. Eribulin mesylate, a microtubule-destabilizing agent, is the only 'classical' cytotoxic agent approved for the treatment of breast cancer in the last 7 years. This synthetic analogue of halichondrin B, isolated from the marine sponge 'Halicondria Okaida', was responsible for prolonging overall survival of heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients in a large Phase III trial. Eribulin is now under clinical development in earlier settings such as the neo-adjuvant and adjuvant settings. Furthermore, its unique mechanism of action and the absence of cross-resistance with taxanes have led to the design of clinical trials in multiple indications: bladder cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancerâ€¦ The main adverse events are neutropenia, fatigue and peripheral neuropathy.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852360","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.847604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.771006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Taxane","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxane"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.695321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.632144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Eribulin","weight":0.479472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eribulin"},{"name":"Metastatic breast cancer","weight":0.474102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastatic_breast_cancer"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.472774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.390809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.367958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Sponge","weight":0.36537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Marine (ocean)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_(ocean)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
