{"id":77696,"title":"Singing voice handicap mapped by different self-assessment instruments.","abstract":"To map voice handicap of popular singers with a general voice and two singing voice self-assessment questionnaires.Fifty singers, 25 male and 25 female, 23 with vocal complaint and 27 without vocal complaint answered randomly the questionnaires. For the comparison of data, the following statistical tests were performed: Mann-Whitney, Friedman, Wilcoxon, Spearman and Correlation.Data showed that the VHI yielded a smaller handicap when compared to the other two questionnaires (VHI x S-VHI - p=0.001; VHI x MSVH - p=0.004). The S-VHI and MSVH produced similar results (p=0.723). Singers with vocal complaint had a VHI total score of 17.5. The other two instruments showed more deviated scores (S-VHI - 24.9; MSVH - 25.2). There was no relationship between gender and singing style with the handicap perceived. A weak negative correlation between the perceived handicap and the time of singing experience was found (-37.7 to -13.10%), that is, the smaller the time of singing experience, the greater the handicap is.The questionnaires developed for the assessment of singing voice, S-VHI and MSVH, showed to be more specific and correspondent to each other for the evaluation of vocal handicap in singers. Findings showed that the more the time of singer's singing experience, the smaller the handicap is. Gender and singing styles did not influence the perception of the handicap.","date":"2014-01-10","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24408551","annotations":[{"name":"Gender","weight":0.669549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.518909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Vhi Healthcare","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vhi_Healthcare"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Singing","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing"},{"name":"Cartography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography"},{"name":"Milton Friedman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman"},{"name":"723","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/723"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Spearman's rank correlation coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Correspondent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondent"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Complaint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
