{"id":4387,"title":"[Research progress on Plasmodium vivax chloroquine resistance].","abstract":"Malaria remains a serious public health problem, especially in developing countries. With the deepening of the understanding of vivax malaria, Plasmodium vivax is also attracting more and more attention. An effective drug treatment is the foundation of controlling or even eliminating malaria. In recent years, more and more reports of chloroquine-resistance Plasmodium vivax have been reported. Plasmodium vivax chloroquine resistance has been a focus problem in vivax malaria prevention and treatment. In this paper, the research progress on distribution situation, detection methods and molecular markers of Plasmodium vivax chloroquine resistance is summarized.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345166","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.82955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.725667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.479809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.435087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.366936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.365789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Chloroquine","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroquine"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Foundation (non-profit)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(non-profit)"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.0243874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0239857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Malaria prophylaxis","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_prophylaxis"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Methods of detecting extrasolar planets","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_extrasolar_planets"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
