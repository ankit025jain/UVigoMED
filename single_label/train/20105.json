{"id":20105,"title":"State focus on health care-associated infection prevention in nursing homes.","abstract":"Despite increased focus on health care-associated infections (HAI), between 1.6 and 3.8 million HAI occur annually among the vulnerable population residing in US nursing homes (NH). This study characterized state department of health (DOH) activities and policies intended to improve quality and reduce HAI in NH.We created a 17-item standardized data collection tool informed by 20 state DOH Web sites, reviewed by experts in the field and piloted by 2 independent reviewers (Cohen's ? .45-.73). The tool and corresponding protocol were used to systematically evaluate state DOH Web sites and related links.Three categories of data were abstracted: (1) consumer-directed information intended to increase accountability of and competition between NH, including mandatory HAI reporting and NH inspection reports; (2) surveyor training for federally-mandated NH inspections; and (3) guidance for NH providers to prevent HAI and monitor incidence. Only 5 states included HAI reporting in NH with differing HAI types and reporting requirements.State DOH information and activities focused on NH quality and reducing HAI were inconsistent. Systematically characterizing state DOH efforts to reduce HAI in NH is important to interpret the effects of these activities.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679560","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.631202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.521073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.435614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Competition","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"United States Department of State","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Accountability","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Inspection","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspection"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"New Hampshire","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire"},{"name":"Computer monitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Independent school (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Department of Health (Philippines)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(Philippines)"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"}]}
