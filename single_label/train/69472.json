{"id":69472,"title":"Enzalutamide after docetaxel and abiraterone therapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.","abstract":"Enzalutamide is a novel antiandrogen which is approved for the treatment of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after taxane-based chemotherapy. The efficacy of enzalutamide after the sequence docetaxel and abiraterone is not proven.Thirty-five mCRPC patients in the German compassionate use program, who received enzalutamide after progression with taxane-based chemotherapy and abiraterone were prospectively evaluated. The endpoints of the study were overall survival, radiologic progression-free survival and safety.The median treatment duration on enzalutamide was 2.8 months. The median overall survival was 7.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.7-10.3] while median progression-free survival assessed by imaging was 3.1 months (95% CI 1.4-4.8). The most common toxicities of all grades were anemia and weight loss.Although the results are limited by a small patient number, the consecutive use of enzalutamide and abiraterone after taxane-based chemotherapy shows a modest clinical activity. Thus, sequence therapy alternating between chemotherapy and antihormonal drugs might be a more promising approach in mCRPC treatment.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24442834","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.830092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.667881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.481252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Antiandrogen","weight":0.450458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiandrogen"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.412609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.346553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.33096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Expanded access","weight":0.26201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_access"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.129987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Abiraterone","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiraterone"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
