{"id":59090,"title":"Neonatal uterine prolapse - a case report.","abstract":"Uterine prolapse is commonly seen in the geriatric age group. Congenital vaginouterine prolapse is a rare condition occurring in neonates and is usually associated with spinal cord malformations in about 85% of cases. Several modalities of treatment have been described for neonatal uterine prolapse. Conservative treatment in the form of simple digital reposition, use of pessary or other self-retaining device is usually sufficient to treat this condition, which is self-limiting and regressive. Here we report our first case of neonatal uterine prolapse, managed successfully with simple digital reposition.
