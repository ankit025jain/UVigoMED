{"id":65813,"title":"Vitamin A and risk of bladder cancer: a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies.","abstract":"Epidemiological studies have reported the preventive effect of vitamin A intake on bladder cancer. However, the findings are inconsistent. To address this issue we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the quantitative effects of vitamin A on bladder cancer.We searched MEDLINE and Embase databases and the references of the relevant articles in English to include studies on dietary or blood vitamin A for the risk of bladder cancer. We performed a meta-analysis using both fixed-effects and random-effects models.Twenty-five articles on dietary vitamin A or blood vitamin A were included according to the eligibility criteria. The pooled risk estimates of bladder cancer were 0.82 (95% CI 0.65, 0.95) for total vitamin A intake, 0.88 (95% CI 0.73, 1.02) for retinol intake, and 0.64 (95% CI 0.38, 0.90) for blood retinol levels. We also found inverse associations between subtypes of carotenoids and bladder cancer risk.The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that high vitamin A intake was associated with a lower risk of bladder cancer. Larger studies with prospective design and rigorous methodology should be considered to validate the current findings.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773914","annotations":[{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.80736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Vitamin A","weight":0.736326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.713528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.650402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.410955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.303234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Retinol","weight":0.287223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinol"},{"name":"Carotenoid","weight":0.219595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotenoid"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.122601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"The Model Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Model_Home"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
