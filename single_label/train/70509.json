{"id":70509,"title":"Influence of sense of coherence, spirituality, social support and health perception on breast cancer screening motivation and behaviors in African American women.","abstract":"Despite formidable barriers, some African American women (AAW) engage in breast cancer screening (BCS) behaviors. Understanding individual characteristics that allow AAW to overcome barriers to BCS is critical to reduce breast cancer mortality among AAW. A salutogenic model of health was used to evaluate the influence of sense of coherence, social support, spirituality and health perception on BCS motivation and behaviors in AAW, and to determine differences in these factors in AAW who participate in free BCS programs compared to AAW who do not. Findings revealed that greater levels of spirituality were significantly associated with greater motivation to practice BCS. Further, women who utilized free BCS programs reported significantly greater rates of both performing and of intent to perform breast self examinations (BSE) in the future, obtaining clinical breast exams and mammograms. Findings can inform the development of culturally specific programs to improve the utilization of BCS programs by AAW.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25181785","annotations":[{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Spirituality","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.551897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.534317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.491269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.454937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.343573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.314446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.297053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bovine spongiform encephalopathy","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.212661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.18903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.121638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Anti-aircraft warfare","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare"},{"name":"Breast self-examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_self-examination"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"}]}
