{"id":30231,"title":"Detection of HLA-B*57:01 by real-time PCR: implementation into routine clinical practice and additional validation data.","abstract":"HLA-B*57:01 status needs to be determined before initiating abacavir therapy. We developed a pharmacogenetic real-time (Q)-PCR screening test using two sets of sequence specific primers. This test has been implemented into routine clinical practice.HIV-infected patients admitted at our University Hospital were thus genotyped using the above mentioned test. A panel of 80 DNA samples with a known genotype were used to characterize Q-PCR conditions using different master mixes.A total of 353 patients were genotyped, detecting 15 (4.25%) HLA-B*57:01 positive carriers. Among the negative patients, 17.2% were treated with abacavir without any hypersensitivity reaction. Using different Q-PCR master mixes, significantly lower cutoff Ct values were found, thus new analytical settings are provided.The pharmacogenetic test developed in our laboratory for the fast screening of HLA-B*57:01 can be successfully implemented into routine clinical practice. All 16 sequences (including an additional six) currently known for the HLA-B*57:01 allele are detected by sequence specific primers used in this test. The Brilliant II SYBR(Â®) Green QPCR MM (Stratagene) can safely replace the master mix originally used to develop the test.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533711","annotations":[{"name":"Allele","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.82371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.794493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.668902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"DNA profiling","weight":0.419803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.357191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.312335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"SYBR Green I","weight":0.17034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYBR_Green_I"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Electron hole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole"},{"name":"Abacavir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacavir"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Master's degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Military Medal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Medal"},{"name":"Master recording","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_recording"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
