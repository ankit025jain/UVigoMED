{"id":83413,"title":"[Complications and prophylaxis strategies of posterior hemivertebra resection for congenital scoliosis].","abstract":"To evaluate the surgical outcomes and related complications of posterior hemivertebra resection with transpedicular instrumentation in the treatment of congenital scoliosis caused by fully-segmented non-incarcerated hemivertebra.From January 2003 to January 2012, one hundred and forty consecutive cases of congenital scoliosis treated by posterior hemivertebra resection with transpedicular instrumentation were investigated retrospectively. Radiographs were reviewed to determine the type and location of the hemivertebra, the coronal curve magnitude, sagittal alignment, compensatory cranial curve and compensatory caudal curve preoperatively, postoperatively and at the latest follow-up. Operative reports and patient charts were reviewed to record operation time, fusion level and complications.One hundred and fifty-one posterior hemivertebra resections in 140 patients aged 2 to 45 years (average 10.8 years) with non-incarcerated hemivertebra were evaluated. All the patients were followed up from 3 to 119 months (average 25 months). The average fusion level was 5.0 segments (2-11 segments). There was a mean improvement of 71.3% in the segmental scoliosis from 42.5째 before surgery to 10.6째 at the time of the latest follow-up, and a mean improvement of 66.8% in segmental kyphosis from 29.5째 to 7.2째 at the same periods. There were 14 complications (13 patients), 3 pedicle fractures, 2 rod breakages, 2 pedicle elongation, 2 removed implants for prominent implants, 2 delayed wound healing, 2 additional surgeries for curve progression, 1 prolonged respiratory support. There was no neurological complication.Posterior hemivertebra resection with transpedicular instrumentation is a safe and effective procedure for congenital scoliosis patients.Neurological complication is rare, but implant-related complication still remains a challenge.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25370753","annotations":[{"name":"Scoliosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.747562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.642799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Kyphosis","weight":0.63581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyphosis"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.591444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.532539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.350915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.304947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.287979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.206846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.119278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.104762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Pedicle of vertebral arch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicle_of_vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Instrumentation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Rod cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Compensatory damages","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensatory_damages"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
