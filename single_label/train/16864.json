{"id":16864,"title":"Timeliness of Salmonella Typhimurium notifications after the introduction of routine MLVA typing in NSW.","abstract":"Salmonella Typhimurium is the most common bacterial cause of gastrointestinal disease in NSW. Regular review of surveillance procedures ensures system objectives are met and informs improvements in system utility and efficiency. This paper assesses the timeliness and data completeness of NSW Salmonella Typhimurium surveillance after the routine introduction of multilocus variable repeat analysis (MLVA), a rapid sub-typing technique. MLVA results were available significantly earlier than alternate sub-typing techniques over the 2 years of this review. Accordingly, from a timeliness perspective, MLVA offers a favourable Salmonella Typhimurium sub-typing option in NSW. Further opportunities to improve timeliness and data completeness are identified. This paper was produced as part of a review of Salmonella Typhimurium surveillance in NSW for the period 2008-2009 by members of OzFoodNet based at Hunter New England Population Health. OzFoodNet is a national network established by the then Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing in 2000 to enhance foodborne disease surveillance in Australia.
