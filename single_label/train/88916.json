{"id":88916,"title":"[Dislocation after total hip arthroplasty--the problem is still present, reasons and treatments].","abstract":"Dislocation after total hip replacement remains a significant problem in orthopedic practice. Despite the use of more modem implants risk of instability is estimated at a few percent for primary treatment and for several procedures. The standard procedure in case of the first dislocation is reduction of the prosthesis in general anesthesia. Further investigation is individual, each case must be thoroughly examined for proper execution of the original surgery and the risk of the next dislocation. Regardless of the subsequent procedures performed a key role in the event of instability prosthesis plays properly conducted rehabilitation and patient education.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779210","annotations":[{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.723856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.718362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.295809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.27681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.269337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0940019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Modem","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
