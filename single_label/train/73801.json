{"id":73801,"title":"Association between risk of oral precancer and genetic variations in microRNA and related processing genes.","abstract":"MicroRNAs have been implicated in cancer but studies on their role in precancer, such as leukoplakia, are limited. Sequence variations at eight miRNA and four miRNA processing genes were studied in 452 healthy controls and 299 leukoplakia patients to estimate risk of disease.Genotyping by TaqMan assay followed by statistical analyses showed that variant genotypes at Gemin3 and mir-34b reduced risk of disease [OR?=?0.5(0.3-0.9) and OR?=?0.7(0.5-0.9) respectively] in overall patients as well as in smokers [OR?=?0.58(0.3-1) and OR?=?0.68(0.5-0.9) respectively]. Among chewers, only mir29a significantly increased risk of disease [OR?=?1.8(1-3)]. Gene-environment interactions using MDR-pt program revealed that mir29a, mir34b, mir423 and Xpo5 modulated risk of disease (p?<?0.002) which may be related to change in expression of these genes as observed by Real-Time PCR assays. But association between polymorphisms and gene expressions was not found in our sample set as well as in larger datasets from open access platforms like Genevar and 1000 Genome database.Variations in microRNAs and their processing genes modulated risk of precancer but further in-depth study is needed to understand mechanism of disease process.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885463","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.837401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"TaqMan","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaqMan"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.780386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.709756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic variation","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.335733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.163251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.139972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Open access (publishing)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_(publishing)"},{"name":"Leukoplakia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukoplakia"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"813","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/813"},{"name":"680","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/680"},{"name":"423","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/423"},{"name":"580","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/580"},{"name":"Railway platform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_platform"},{"name":"Expression (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Post-transcriptional modification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-transcriptional_modification"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Obshchina","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obshchina"},{"name":"Realtime (radio show)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realtime_(radio_show)"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
