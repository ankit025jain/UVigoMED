{"id":1052,"title":"[Multidisciplinary team in cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention, from the assessment to the education: an educational project].","abstract":"The authors explain the training project: \"Multidisciplinarity in cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention: from the evaluation to the therapeutic education\", the rationale and purpose of a pathway for patients with ischemic heart disease treated in the acute phase with both medical and surgical means, and then placed in a rehabilitation program. The training project was transformed into a learning event for the Region of Sicily and later for the Region of Tuscany that has adopted it, encouraging the spread over the entire region. It highlights the role of the team, which focuses on the patient, converging on it multidisciplinary expertise whose goal is the reintegration of the subjects in their life-context, with appropriate evaluation, treatment and changes in lifestyle. From the valuations and declining the specific interventions to each job profile according to the principle of synergy obtained by multi-professional integration.
