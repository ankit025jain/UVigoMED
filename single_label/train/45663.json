{"id":45663,"title":"Fatigue severity and factors associated with high fatigue levels in Korean patients with inflammatory bowel disease.","abstract":"Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often complain of fatigue. To date, only a few studies in Western countries have focused on fatigue related to IBD, and fatigue has never been specifically studied in Asian IBD patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the fatigue level and fatigue-related factors among Korean IBD patients.Patients in remission or with mild to moderate IBD were included. Fatigue was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue and the Brief Fatigue Inventory. Corresponding healthy controls (HCs) also completed both fatigue questionnaires.Sixty patients with Crohn disease and 68 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) were eligible for analysis. The comparison group consisted of 92 HCs. Compared with the HCs, both IBD groups were associated with greater levels of fatigue (p<0.001). Factors influencing the fatigue score in UC patients included anemia and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).Greater levels of fatigue were detected in Korean IBD patients compared with HCs. Anemia and ESR were determinants of fatigue in UC patients. Physicians need to be aware of fatigue as one of the important symptoms of IBD to better understand the impact of fatigue on health-related quality of life.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672655","annotations":[{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.843373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.750864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.738981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.714305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.467703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.249659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
