{"id":66118,"title":"[Aortic valve replacement for recurrent aortic stenosis after percutaneous transluminal balloon aortic valvuloplasty( PTAV) in a cancer patient].","abstract":"We report a case of aortic valve replacement( AVR) for recurrent aortic stenosis(AS) after percutaneous transluminal balloon aortic valvuloplasty( PTAV) in a patient with left renal pelvis carcinoma. A 65-year-old female had been suffering from shortness of breath and syncope due to severe AS. She was considered to be a candidate for AVR. Preoperative examination revealed advanced left renal pelvis carcinoma that was a critical comorbidity for AVR. Ureteronephrectomy was also considered to be a contraindication. Despite conservative treatment, her condition was deteriorated. Emergency PTAV was performed when she was transferred to our hospital with circulatory shock. Her symptoms were ameliorated and left ureteronephrectomy was conducted 8 month after the PTAV. She was readmitted to our hospital 16 month after the PTAV and AVR was performed successfully.Antegrade transseptal PTAV is a very useful palliative therapy for AS with severe comorbidities as a bridge to surgery.
