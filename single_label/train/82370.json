{"id":82370,"title":"Matrix metalloproteinases and inflammatory cytokines in the oral fluid of patients with chronic generalized periodontitis various structural materials restoration of teeth and dentition.","abstract":"Results of comparative immunoenzymatic study of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, 8 and 9, interleukins (IL) If and 6, tissue MMP inhibitors (TIMP-1and TIMP-2) and TNF-a in oral fluid of patients with different teeth and denture constructive materials show that MMP-9 content in oral fluid can serve as a marker of chronic generalized periodontitis because it is elevated in all patients irrespective of presence or absence of metallic tooth restorations. MMP-8 level is elevated as compared to control only in periodontitis patients with metallic restorations. The character of correlative relationships between the parameters studied in various patients'groups demonstrate relative similarity of MMP, IL and TIMP secretion regulation in patients with intact periodontal. In patients with inflammatory destructive periodontal lesions both with and without metallic restorations the correlation data reveal a cascade of biochemical reactions in response to etiologic factors. More pronounced response is observed in periodontitis patients with metallic orthopedic constructions. The presence of chromium-cobalt or chromium-nickel constructions leads to an increase of MMP-2, IL-lf and IL-6 content in oral fluid.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640096","annotations":[{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.586689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.563726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","weight":0.559674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.437984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.429397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.401841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.231231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.184824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.143256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
