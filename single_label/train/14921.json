{"id":14921,"title":"Rapid detection of subtype B avian metapneumoviruses using RT-PCR restriction endonuclease digestion indicates field circulation of vaccine-derived viruses in older turkeys.","abstract":"Live vaccines predominantly control avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) infection in poultry flocks, but vaccine virus can be found for extended periods after application. The most frequently used aMPV vaccine in Italy, VCO3 subtype B, was shown to contain a unique Tru9I restriction endonuclease site within the amplicons produced by a commonly used aMPV diagnostic reverse transcriptase (RT)-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Analysis of European and database logged subtype B aMPV sequences confirmed that the sequence occurred only in the VC03 vaccine. A subsequent RT-PCR restriction endonuclease study of field samples, collected from turkeys between 2007 and 2012, detected subtype B vaccine-derived strains in 12 of 90 samples tested that were collected from birds under 12 weeks of age.
