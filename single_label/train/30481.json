{"id":30481,"title":"Histological protection by nilvadipine against neurotoxicity induced by NOC12, a nitric oxide donor, in the rat retina.","abstract":"In the present study, we histologically examined the effects of nilvadipine on neuronal injury induced by intravitreal (i.v.) N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (200?nmol/eye) and intravitreal NOC12 (400?nmol/eye), a nitric oxide donor, in the rat retina. Morphometric evaluation at 7?d after injection of NMDA or NOC12 showed that treatment with nilvadipine (1?mg/kg, i.v.) 15?min prior to injection of NMDA or NOC12 dramatically reduced the retinal damage. These results suggest that nilvadipine protects neurons against excitotoxic injury in the rat retina in vivo at least in part via an antioxidative effect.
