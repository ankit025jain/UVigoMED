{"id":82563,"title":"Invasive carcinoma arising from sclerosing polycystic adenosis of the salivary gland.","abstract":"Sclerosing polycystic adenosis is a rare salivary gland lesion. Recently, this entity has been regarded as a neoplastic lesion of low-grade malignant potential but, to date, no invasive carcinoma, metastases, or associated mortality have been reported. We report the first case of an invasive carcinoma component in a recurrent sclerosing polycystic adenosis lesion.
