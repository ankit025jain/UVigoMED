{"id":64811,"title":"Pumpkin seed oil (prostafit) or prazosin? Which one is better in the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia.","abstract":"To assess the efficacy of drugs containing herbal extracts in the treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.The clinical trial study was performed in 2011-2012 at Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran. One hundred patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia were randomly divided into 2 equal groups receiving prostafit and prazosin, respectively. Quality of life and International Prostatic Symptom Score questionnaire were filled and prostate specific antigen level, uroflowmetry and prostate volume were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months after the medication. The data was analysed using SPSS 15 and repeated measure analysis of variance.No complications were observed during and after the treatment. International Prostatic Symptom Score had significant differences at baseline and 6 months after the treatment in both groups, specially in group 2 18 vs 22 (36% versus 44%). Quality of life was better in group 2, 25.5 vs 31.5 (51% versus 63%). prostate specific antigen level did not change after the treatment and there was no remarkable difference in either group.Prostafit is an effective and safe treatment in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia but not as much as prozasin.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252490","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.782668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.720698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.663387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.661374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.63852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.615555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.409813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Pumpkin","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prazosin","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prazosin"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pumpkin seed oil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin_seed_oil"},{"name":"Vegetable fats and oils","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_fats_and_oils"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Pepita","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepita"},{"name":"Imam","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imam"}]}
