{"id":20789,"title":"[The factorial analysis in evaluation of cell immunity of patients with pyo-inflammatory diseases of long bones and large joints].","abstract":"The factorial analysis was applied to calculate the values of main components determining condition of cell immunity in patients with pyo-inflammatory diseases of long bones and large joints. It is demonstrated that in conditions of chronic purulent infection the main are the factors related with regulative T-lymphocytes involved in suppression of T-cell immunity. In case of development of fistula form of osteomyelitis the main role is attached to mechanisms related to markers of activation of T-lymphocytes and to derangement of expression of HLA-DR on monocytes in case of infection of prosthesis.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640110","annotations":[{"name":"Osteomyelitis","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomyelitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.710481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.671986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.485148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.417046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.3604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Long bone","weight":0.240152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_bone"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Factorial","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Derangement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
