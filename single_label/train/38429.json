{"id":38429,"title":"Commentary on ''dynamic analysis of histamine-mediated attenuation of acetylcholine-induced sweating via GSK3? activation''.","abstract":"Matsui et al. (2014) delineate a novel pathomechanism for attenuated sweating in atopic dermatitis (AD). They provide evidence that acetylcholine-induced sweating can be inhibited via H1-receptor activation. This work suggests that H1 blockers may be useful in patients with AD.
