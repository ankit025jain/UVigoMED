{"id":53273,"title":"Role of endogenous GLP-1 and its agonists in osteopenia and osteoporosis: but we little know until tried.","abstract":"The present brief review looks at the evidence on the role of GLP-1 and its agonists in osteopenia and osteoporosis in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). There is accumulating data to suggest a favourable effect of GLP-1 on bone metabolism. However, most data is from experimental studies, while clinical confirmation is still inadequate. Moreover, little is known on the precise mechanisms underlying these effects. Therefore, we need randomised clinical trials in T2DM patients to learn more on the action of GLP-1 on bone metabolism and its potential clinical implications.
