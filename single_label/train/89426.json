{"id":89426,"title":"Special anesthetic consideration for the patient with a fragility fracture.","abstract":"In this article, an overview is presented of perioperative management of the patient with a fragility fracture, including preoperative risk stratification and optimization, anesthesia risks, anesthesia options, and postoperative pain management. Issues of preoperative evaluation that are of concern for the anesthesiologist because of their direct effect on intraoperative care are discussed. A team interdisciplinary approach and good communication between specialties involved in care of elderly surgical patients is important for optimal patient outcomes and to avoid perioperative complications. Cooperation between anesthesiology and medicine is indispensable in reaching a reasonable consensus regarding preoperative evaluation and should occur on a case-by-case basis.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721364","annotations":[{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.757154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.566914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.296208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.277756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.220637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.182633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0824005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Pathologic fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture"},{"name":"Direct effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_effect"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Issues (Korn album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issues_(Korn_album)"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
