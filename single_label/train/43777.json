{"id":43777,"title":"Liver lobe torsion in pet rabbits: clinical consequences, diagnosis, and treatment.","abstract":"This article reviews diagnosis and management of liver lobe torsion in rabbits. Practitioners should recommend initial diagnostics including radiographs and blood work on rabbits presenting with nonspecific signs of gastrointestinal (GI) stasis to better determine possible etiology and make the best treatment recommendations. If hepatic enzyme elevation is found in a rabbit with GI stasis, abdominal ultrasound is recommended to rule out liver lobe torsion. Prompt diagnosis and liver lobectomy are recommended for best outcome in rabbits with liver lobe torsion.
