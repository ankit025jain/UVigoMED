{"id":68257,"title":"Long-term followup and deterioration rate of anterior substitution urethroplasty.","abstract":"We investigated deterioration of the success rate of penile and bulbar substitution urethroplasty.We performed a retrospective descriptive analysis of patients who underwent substitution urethroplasty between July 1994 and September 2007. Inclusion criteria included 1-stage anterior urethroplasty using penile skin or oral mucosa with a minimum of 6 years followup. Patients with posterior urethral stricture, failed hypospadias or incomplete clinical records were excluded from analysis. The primary study outcome was postoperative failure-free survival and the secondary outcome was to identify significant predictors of treatment failure. The clinical outcome was considered a failure when any postoperative instrumentation was needed. Descriptive statistical analysis was done as well as Kaplan-Meier analysis, and univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis.A total of 359 patients were included in study. Median followup was 118 months. Of the procedures 265 (73.8%) were successful and 94 (26.2%) failed, including 91 (96.8%) within the first 5 years. Substitute tissue type (oral mucosa vs skin) was the only significant predictor on univariable analysis (HR 1.86, p = 0.005). This result was confirmed by multivariable analysis adjusting for age at surgery, stricture length and etiology, urethroplasty type and previous treatments (HR 2.26, p = 0.001).Deterioration after anterior 1-stage substitution urethroplasty seems to develop within the first 5 years. Oral mucosa showed greater failure-free survival than penile skin and 1-stage penile urethroplasty showed the same success rate as bulbar urethroplasty.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533999","annotations":[{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.823523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.799186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Hypospadias","weight":0.788785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypospadias"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.581342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.512224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.418003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.319566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.156848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.028018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"265","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/265"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"359","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/359"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Corticobulbar tract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticobulbar_tract"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Substitute (The Who song)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(The_Who_song)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
