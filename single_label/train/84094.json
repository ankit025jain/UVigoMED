{"id":84094,"title":"[Alterations in expression and function of ABC transporters and ERM proteins in inflammation].","abstract":"Pathophysiological changes in infection or inflammation are associated with alterations in the production of numerous absorption-, distribution-, metabolism-, and excretion-related proteins. However, little information is available on the effects of inflammation on the expression levels and activities of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We examined the effects of acute (on day 7) and chronic (on day 21) inflammation on the expression of ABC transporters in some major tissues in rats. Adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) in rats was used as an animal model of inflammation. The mRNA levels of mdr1a and mdr1b encoding P-glycoprotein (P-gp) decreased significantly in the liver of AA rats on day 21. Hepatic protein levels of P-gp, Mrp2, and Bcrp decreased significantly in the membrane but not in the homogenate of AA rats after 7 days and after 21 days of treatment with adjuvant. Recently, ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins have been found to show linker activity for some transporters and F-actin. We examined the expression levels and functions of ERM proteins in AA because the membrane localization of ABC transporters was decreased without any change in total expression levels. In this review, we summarize our recent work and reports of ERM proteins relevant to ABC transporters.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174362","annotations":[{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.819178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.662118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"ATP-binding cassette transporter","weight":0.533071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP-binding_cassette_transporter"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.454125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.340679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"P-glycoprotein","weight":0.303291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-glycoprotein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.244178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.0916205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"American Broadcasting Company","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company"},{"name":"Homogenization (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogenization_(biology)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Compact Cassette","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Cassette"},{"name":"Linker (computing)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)"},{"name":"Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitteldeutscher_Rundfunk"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
