{"id":37613,"title":"Adult type 3 Gaucher disease as manifestation of R463C/Rec Nci I mutation: first reported case in the world literature.","abstract":"Gaucher disease is the most common lysosomal storage disorder. It is autosomal recessive in nature and results from mutations in the GBA gene coding for acid beta glucosidase. It is classified into three types based on CNS involvement and its severity. Type 3, or chronic neuronopathic Gaucher disease, generally has an onset in childhood and by definition, includes all patients with any form of neurologic involvement who have survived the first few years of life. Here we present a 36 year old male patient presenting with hip pain showing bilateral avascular necrosis of femoral head with massive splenomegaly and on evaluation, showed mental retardation, seizures, bilateral vertical and horizontal gaze palsies and eventually turned out to be type 3b Gaucher disease. This is the first case of Type 3 Gaucher disease being reported from India with mutation analysis and only case of Type 3 Gaucher disease in world literature showing R463C/Rec Nci I mutation.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482953","annotations":[{"name":"Gaucher's disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaucher's_disease"},{"name":"Lysosomal storage disease","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosomal_storage_disease"},{"name":"Splenomegaly","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Autosomal recessive","weight":0.811935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_recessive"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.791357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lysosome","weight":0.60838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.542599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.500501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"India","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.220202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.150554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.126772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.122372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Conjugate gaze palsy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gaze_palsy"},{"name":"Glucocerebrosidase","weight":0.0248497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocerebrosidase"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Glycoside hydrolase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside_hydrolase"},{"name":"Bell's palsy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_palsy"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
