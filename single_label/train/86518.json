{"id":86518,"title":"How many names for a rose: inconsistent classification of multiple foci of lung cancer due to ambiguous rules.","abstract":"Stage classification is important because it allows consistent definition of patient groups, and thus provides a foundation for comparison of outcomes. For patients with multiple pulmonary foci of lung cancer, however, the classification rules are ambiguous and confusing.We surveyed experts and clinicians who regularly evaluate patients with lung cancer to see how similar or different their interpretation of the official stage classification was for such patients.We found a great deal of inconsistency in how four clinical scenarios were classified. No method of classification was chosen by a majority when there were more than two choices allowed by the classification rules. In a scenario with pulmonary foci of cancer of different histologic types, 86% classified this as separate primary cancers and 14% as multifocal lung cancer.The marked variability in classification must be taken into account when interpreting reported outcomes of patients with multiple pulmonary foci of lung cancer.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768582","annotations":[{"name":"Patient","weight":0.456724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.403718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.385955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.240041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.143205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Foundation (non-profit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(non-profit)"},{"name":"Focus (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry)"},{"name":"List of names of Odin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_names_of_Odin"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
