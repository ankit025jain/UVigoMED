{"id":30579,"title":"Cardiac magnetic resonance in cocaine-induced myocardial damage.","abstract":"A 54-year-old male with history of cocaine abuse underwent trans-thoracic echocardiography that showed hyper-echogenicity of the basal segments of the septum and infero-lateral wall of the left ventricle. The patient underwent cardiac CT that reported diffuse non-obstructive CAD. Cardiac MR showed LGE patterns consistent with non-ischemic myocardial damage associated with cocaine abuse.
