{"id":52759,"title":"Diabetic control and coronary artery bypass: effect on short-term outcomes.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of preoperative glycemic control on hospital morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass grafting.Data of 3857 patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass grafting was prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. There were 1109 (29%) diabetic patients, of whom 712 (64%) had hemoglobin A1c levels recorded. They were categorized by diabetic treatment: diet (179), oral hypoglycemic agent, (718) or insulin (212); and by diabetic control: hemoglobin A1c?<?7 (265) or ?7 (447). Nondiabetic patients (2,748) were used as controls.The preoperative risk factors of hypertension (p?<?0.001), hyperlipidemia (p?<?0.001), renal failure (p?<?0.04), peripheral vascular disease (p?<?0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p?<?0.04) were significantly more prevalent in diabetic patients. Major complications were not significantly different between the diabetic and control groups (p?=?0.33), but minor complications were less frequent in diabetic patients (p?=?0.03). Major and minor complications were not significantly different among the treatment subgroups of diabetic patients (p?=?0.74 and p?=?0.48) or in those with hemoglobin A1c?<?7 and ?7 (p?=?0.23, p?=?0.41).Short-term outcomes were not affected by the degree of preoperative glycemic control or type of treatment used in diabetic patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass grafting. A plausible explanation is strict protocol-driven glycemic control in the perioperative period.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570493","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.896071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Peripheral vascular disease","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vascular_disease"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.851497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.752823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.626523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.572465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.491164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Vascular disease","weight":0.425681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.398761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.271842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.262745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.210686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
