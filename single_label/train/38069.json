{"id":38069,"title":"Gene delivery strategies for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidoses.","abstract":"Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) disorders are genetic diseases caused by deficiencies in the lysosomal enzymes responsible for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans. Current treatments are not able to correct all disease symptoms and are not available for all MPS types, which makes gene therapy especially relevant. Multiple gene therapy approaches have been tested for different types of MPS, and our aim in this study is to critically analyze each of them.In this review, we have included the major studies that describe the use of adeno-associated retroviral and lentiviral vectors, as well as relevant non-viral approaches for MPS disorders.Some protocols such as the use of adeno-associated vectors and lentiviral vectors are approaching the clinic for these disorders and, along with combined approaches, seem to be the future of gene therapy for MPS.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450877","annotations":[{"name":"Mucopolysaccharidosis","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucopolysaccharidosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Retrovirus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lysosome","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome"},{"name":"Glycosaminoglycan","weight":0.682831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosaminoglycan"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.669644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Lentivirus","weight":0.46748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentivirus"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.168036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.0902121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Gene delivery","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_delivery"}]}
