{"id":92243,"title":"Technical difficulties during the training phase for Tightrope® and percutaneous lateral fabellar suture techniques for cranial cruciate ligament repair.","abstract":"To compare level of difficulty, deviations from technical description and postoperative assessment during the training of veterinary students, small animal surgical residents, and a board certified surgeon for Tightrope® (TR) and percutaneous lateral fabella suture (pLFS) techniques for cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) repair.Prospective study.Cadaveric canine pelvic limbs (n = 32).Sixteen 3rd year veterinary students, 6 small animal surgical residents and a Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons performed the TR and pLFS techniques on paired limbs. Perceived level of difficulty, duration of surgery, and technical deviations were assessed by questionnaire, radiographs, and dissection. Results were compared between techniques with McNemar's test.The TR procedure was perceived as more technically demanding than the pLFS by veterinary students and residents. Technical deviations were overall more common after TR than pLFS, and in limbs repaired by students, regardless of procedure. The most difficult aspect of the TR consists of the bone tunnels whereas for pLFS it was passing the suture around the femorofabellar ligament. The sensitivity of radiographs for detection of technical deviations was 39% after TR and 50% after pLFS.Technical deviations are more common during the training phase of TR than pLFS, and the sensitivity of radiographs to detect those is low. Repeated practice on cadavers followed by dissection is recommended before use in patients.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433400","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.765108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.609202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.583971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"American Veterinary Medical Association","weight":0.492058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Veterinary_Medical_Association"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.335411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.113965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Canine tooth","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"},{"name":"Fabella","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabella"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Theodore Roosevelt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Rmdir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rmdir"},{"name":"Certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification"},{"name":"American Board of Medical Specialties","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Board_of_Medical_Specialties"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
