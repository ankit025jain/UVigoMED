{"id":17828,"title":"[Skin infections due to rapid-growing mycobacteria].","abstract":"Rapid-growing mycobacteria (e.g. M. abscessus and M. chelonae) are emerging pathogens with various clinical manifestations. Among immunocompetent individuals, rapid-growing mycobacteria may be responsible of pulmonary, cutaneous, osteoarticular and postoperative infections, as well as lymphadenitis and catheter-associated infections. Among immunocompromised patients, disseminated infections are also observed. Diagnosis relies on specific microbiological investigations to confirm etiology and guide antibiotic treatment. The treatment requires a multi-disciplinary approach that includes specific long-term antibiotic treatment, surgical debridement and reduction of immunosuppression whenever possible.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843991","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.779953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.732163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cellulitis","weight":0.623716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulitis"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.506856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.320704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"}]}
