{"id":4361,"title":"[Investigation of wild feces pollution in schistosomiasis endemic areas in Yunnan Province].","abstract":"To understand the status of wild feces distribution and pollution in schistosomiasis endemic areas in Yunnan Province.According to the distribution of Oncomelania hupensis snails and characteristics of human and animal activities in recent five years, 6 schistosomiasis endemic villages in Weishan, Nanjian and Midu counties (2 villages each county) were selected as the investigated areas and. more than 4 hm2 area with snails around each village were investigated for the types and densities of wild feces. The schistosome infested feces was detected with the hatching method.Totally 63 hm2 were investigated and 420 wild feces were found in all kinds of environments. The densities of wild feces were 0.066 7 piles/100 nm2, and the densities of wild feces of the road and the hillside were the highest (0.098 7 piles/100 m2 and 0.088 0 piles/100 m2 respectively). Totally 260 fresh wild feces were collected, including the feces of human being, cattle, horse, dog, sheep and pig, and the feces of cattle and dog was the most (37.38% and 30.71%, respectively). No schistosome positive feces was found.There are a lot of wild feces in snail areas in Yunnan Province, and the risk of schistosomiasis transmission is still high. Therefore, we should strengthen the banning grazing measures and the investigation of dogs.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434144","annotations":[{"name":"Dog","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.678237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.637421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Horse","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"},{"name":"Grazing","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grazing"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.557429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.507387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Yunnan","weight":0.410886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.375162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Hectare","weight":0.359055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.322139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Road","weight":0.0347418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.0182736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"County","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Foundation (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(engineering)"},{"name":"100 metres","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Counties of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"}]}
