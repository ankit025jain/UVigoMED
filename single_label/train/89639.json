{"id":89639,"title":"[Operative options for rectification after failed osteosynthesis of the distal radius].","abstract":"Even in an era of clear improvements in implants and standardized treatment procedures, abortive osteosynthesis after distal radius fractures is not an uncommon complication.Although not every malunion of the radius leads to complaints, affected patients often suffer from limitations in movement, reduction in strength, pain and aesthetic deficits. Following thorough clinical and imaging diagnostics a selection from the possible treatment options must be made taking the results obtained from the diagnostics into consideration.Operative possibilities are available for reconstructing the anatomical features as accurately as possible, functional improvement without correction of the malunion, pain reduction alone and combined procedures.Despite abortive osteosynthesis of distal radial fractures there are possibilities for anatomical reconstruction, retention of mobility and pain reduction. Taking the pathological deformities into consideration, the highest priority should be given to reconstructing the anatomical joint conditions as accurately as possible, even when the conservative treatment options were unsuccessful.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24695969","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.703722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.540273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.412383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.370838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0375437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
