{"id":47283,"title":"Surgery for breast cancer liver metastases - factors determining results.","abstract":"The results of the surgical treatment of liver metastases from breast cancer (BCLMs) may be determined by various factors. The aim of the present study was to specify the risk factors for surgical treatment of BCLM.Twenty-four female patients with BCLMs were treated with liver resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). We evaluated the effects of patient age, time interval between the breast cancer and BCLM surgery, the type of surgical procedure, histopathological findings of the primary tumor, the number and overall diameter of BCLMs, the presence of resectable extra-hepatic metastases, and local tumor recurrence after breast cancer surgery on patients' overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).Age <50 years and shorter interval between breast and liver surgery were risk factors for poorer OS (p<0.02 and p<0.01, respectively) and for PFS (p<0.01 and p<0.01, respectively). The presence of extra-hepatic metastases was a risk factor for OS (p<0.005). An overall diameter of BCLM ?3.5 cm and a negative status of both estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in the primary tumor were risk factors for poorer PFS (p<0.009 and p<0.0003, respectively).The risk factors for surgery for BCLMs are age <50 years, the presence of extra-hepatic metastases, hormone receptor negativity of the primary tumor and an overall BCLM diameter ?3.5 cm.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24596373","annotations":[{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Progesterone","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone"},{"name":"Radiofrequency ablation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofrequency_ablation"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Hormone receptor","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_receptor"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.587259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.527169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.518573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.413243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.391766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.14573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.0439625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"}]}
