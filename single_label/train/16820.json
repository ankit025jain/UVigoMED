{"id":16820,"title":"Mycobacterium chelonae infection presenting as recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous nodules--a presentation previously diagnosed as Weber Christian disease.","abstract":"Although the dermatologic community rarely uses \"Weber-Christian Disease\" as a diagnosis, it still appears in the internal medicine literature. Herein we present a patient with recurrent cutaneous and subcutaneous nodules who was initially treated with aggressive immunosupression for a presumptive diagnosis of Weber-Christian Disease. After more than a decade the patient was diagnosed with cutaneous Mycobacterium chelonea. This case is an excellent example of the difficulty in diagnosing mycobacterial infections and underscores the importance of having a high suspicion for infectious etiologies for unresponsive cutaneous eruptions in patients on immunosuppressive medications.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24945648","annotations":[{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Internal medicine","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.749826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.730506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.667495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.646318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.373852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Christianity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"}]}
