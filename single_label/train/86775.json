{"id":86775,"title":"Regulation of somatostatin receptor 4-mediated cytostatic effects by CD26 in malignant pleural mesothelioma.","abstract":"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive neoplasm arising from mesothelial lining of pleura. CD26 molecules preferentially expressed on epithelioid type of MPM. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms of CD26 regulating MPM cells in vitro and in vivo.Biochemical and cell biological approaches were used for identifying a novel molecular target of MPM. Its contribution to tumour expansion has been also assessed using animal models. The clinical samples of MPM were also assessed for its expression.We identify that cytostatic effects in MPM are mediated by somatostatin (SST) receptor 4 (SSTR4), being inhibited by the interaction of CD26 molecules. We also indicates that SSTR4-mediated cytostatic effects are regulated by SHP-2 PTP, and that this inhibitory effect by SST agonist is enhanced via lipid raft clustering of associated molecules following crosslinking of anti-CD26 antibody. Finally, using an in vivo xenograft model, we demonstrate that the anti-tumour effect of anti-CD26 mAb is enhanced when combined with SSTR4 agonist treatment, and that SSTR4 is highly coexpressed with CD26 on epithelioid or biphasic types of MPM tissues obtained from patients' surgical specimens.Combination therapy with humanised anti-CD26 mAb and SSTR4 agonist may therefore potentiate anti-tumour effect on MPM.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Respiratory Tract
