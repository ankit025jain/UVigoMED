{"id":20414,"title":"Inhibitive effect on phagocytosis of Candida albicans induced by pretreatment with quercetin via actin cytoskeleton interference.","abstract":"To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of pretreatment with quercetin on macrophages after Candida albicans infection.RAW 264.7 macrophages were used as a target cell line. Cell viability after treatment with quercetin at different time points was detected by Carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester. Phagocytic function of macrophages was determined by a fluorometric assay. Cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. F-actin cytoskeleton of L929 cells was stained by Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin.Pretreatment with quercetin decreased cell viability only at the highest concentration of 37 microg/mL 2, 24, and 48 h after the treatment. The phagocytic efficiency of macrophages pretreated with quercetin was significantly decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner. F-actin labeling showed that the actin cytoskeleton of the cells started to break down 2 h after treatment. Moreover, it notably inhibited cytokine TNF-alpha production after Candida albicans infection.Pretreatment with quercetin induced an anti-inflammatory effect against Candida albicans infection in macrophages.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660615","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Cytoskeleton","weight":0.867542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton"},{"name":"Phagocytosis","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"},{"name":"Ester","weight":0.851154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"},{"name":"Quercetin","weight":0.828216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.784308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.770731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.738159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.610527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.589214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.367146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.302354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.210822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0320572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Alexa Fluor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Fluor"},{"name":"Enzyme assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_assay"},{"name":"Fluorescence spectroscopy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Fluorophore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorophore"},{"name":"N-Hydroxysuccinimide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Hydroxysuccinimide"}]}
