{"id":47452,"title":"Targeted recombinant fusion proteins of IFN? and mimetic IFN? with PDGF?R bicyclic peptide inhibits liver fibrogenesis in vivo.","abstract":"Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), following transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts plays a key role in liver fibrosis. Therefore, attempts to attenuate this myofibroblastic phenotype would be a promising therapeutic approach. Interferon gamma (IFN?) is a potent anti-fibrotic cytokine, but its pleiotropic receptor expression leading to severe adverse effects has limited its clinical application. Since, activated HSC express high-level of platelet derived growth factor beta receptor (PDGF?R), we investigated the potential of PDGF?R-specific targeting of IFN? and its signaling peptide that lacks IFN?R binding site (mimetic IFN? or mimIFN?) in liver fibrosis. We prepared DNA constructs expressing IFN?, mimIFN? or BiPPB (PDGF?R-specific bicyclic peptide)-IFN?, BiPPB-mimIFN? fusion proteins. Both chimeric proteins alongwith IFN? and mimIFN? were produced in E.coli. The expressed proteins were purified and analyzed for PDGF?R-specific binding and in vitro effects. Subsequently, these recombinant proteins were investigated for the liver uptake (pSTAT1? signaling pathway), for anti-fibrotic effects and adverse effects (platelet counts) in CCl4-induced liver fibrogenesis in mice. The purified HSC-targeted IFN? and mimIFN? fusion proteins showed PDGF?R-specific binding and significantly reduced TGF?-induced collagen-I expression in human HSC (LX2 cells), while mouse IFN? and mimIFN? did not show any effect. Conversely, mouse IFN? and BiPPB-IFN? induced activation and dose-dependent nitric oxide release in mouse macrophages (express IFN?R while lack PDGF?R), which was not observed with mimIFN? and BiPPB-mimIFN?, due to the lack of IFN?R binding sites. In vivo, targeted BiPPB-IFN? and BiPPB-mimIFN? significantly activated intrahepatic IFN?-signaling pathway compared to IFN? and mimIFN? suggesting increased liver accumulation. Furthermore, the targeted fusion proteins ameliorated liver fibrogenesis in mice by significantly reducing collagen and ?-SMA expression and potentiating collagen degradation. IFN? also induced reduction in fibrogenesis but showed significant decrease in platelet counts, which was restored with targeted proteins. These results suggest that these rationally designed proteins can be further developed as novel anti-fibrotic therapeutics.
