{"id":53700,"title":"Unmasking a young adult migratory deep venous thrombosis--case report.","abstract":"Venous thromboembolism is a known complication of cancer which impacts on patient mortality and quality of life. The primary site of cancer is an important risk factor, with highest rates observed in patients with brain, pancreas, gastric, kidney, ovary and lung cancers. The extent of metastatic spread further adds to the risk. In this article, we present the case of a young patient who was diagnosed with an aggressive form of pancreatic neoplasm with secondary determinations, without any previous digestive symptoms, with the occasion of a recurrent and migratory deep venous thrombosis (DVT).","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502070","annotations":[{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.85772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.746624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.246245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.225263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"}]}
