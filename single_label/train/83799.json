{"id":83799,"title":"[Pseudohalitosis and halitophobia].","abstract":"Halitosis, or bad breath occurs in 25 % of the population. 85% of the causes are located within the oral cavity (for example: periodontitis, pathologicaly coated tongue or poor oral hygiene). This is the reason why the dentist is often the first person, who sees patients presenting this problem. While some patients feel that their breath smells bad, people with genuine halitosis usually do not notice this fact, which has been called the \"bad breath paradox\". For people in whom symptoms of halitosis are not present, and yet they complain about having them, psuedohalitosis or halitophobia are described. The phenomena responsible for the increase in the number of cases of halitophobia and pseudohalitosis are advertising of oral hygiene products and the fact that patients pay more attention to the quality of mouth odour. It is important to make a correct diagnosis, identify the causes of the disease and to take appropriate steps in order to cure the patient. The paper presents, on the basis of literature, causes of pseudohalitosis and halitophobia and describes the treatment of patients who have been diagnosed with these conditions.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25248243","annotations":[{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Halitosis","weight":0.83444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halitosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.370553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Odor","weight":0.212269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odor"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Advertising","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0961829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Paradox","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
