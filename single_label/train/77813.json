{"id":77813,"title":"Outcomes following Semicircular Canal Plugging.","abstract":"To examine audiometric outcomes, symptom control rates, and complication rates following semicircular canal plugging for superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome.Retrospective chart review.Private, neurotologic tertiary referral center.Patients undergoing semicircular canal plugging for superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2012. Pre- and postoperative audiometry, vestibular testing, operative findings, and clinical symptoms were assessed through chart review.A total of 24 ears underwent a canal plugging procedure during the study period for superior canal dehiscence syndrome. Pre- and postoperative air conduction pure-tone averages were 21.1 and 22.5 dB (P = .42, not significant [NS]). The average pre- and postoperative word recognition scores were 95.8% and 95.1% (P = .48, NS). Vestibular evoked myogenic potential data showed reduced thresholds in 7 patients with canal dehiscence. Complications were limited to a single, temporary facial weakness. Complete symptom improvement was noted in 35.7% of all patients, while at least partial symptom improvement was found in over 80% of patients.Semicircular canal plugging procedures are associated with excellent hearing outcomes and may reduce preoperative symptoms in patients with superior semicircular canal dehiscence.","date":"2014-09-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24962178","annotations":[{"name":"Ear","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.540479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.429076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Superior canal dehiscence","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_canal_dehiscence"},{"name":"Audiometry","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiometry"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Semicircular canal","weight":0.053079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircular_canal"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Superior semicircular canal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_semicircular_canal"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"Nova Scotia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia"},{"name":"Private (rank)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_(rank)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Absolute threshold of hearing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold_of_hearing"},{"name":"Semicircle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircle"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Vestibular","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Myogenic contraction","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myogenic_contraction"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Word","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Dehiscence (botany)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehiscence_(botany)"},{"name":"Facial weakness","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_weakness"}]}
