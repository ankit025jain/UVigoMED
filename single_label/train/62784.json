{"id":62784,"title":"CD163 immunohistochemistry is superior to CD68 in predicting outcome in classical Hodgkin lymphoma.","abstract":"In recent years, research has increasingly focused on the microenvironment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) as a predictor of treatment outcome. The focus of this study was to assess the interobserver reproducibility in interpreting macrophage-associated immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD68 and CD163 in a retrospective cohort of 88 patients with CHL.Staining results were correlated with clinical outcome in all patients and those with a high international prognostic score (IPS).The intraclass correlation (ICC) for the five hematopathologists interpreting the IHC was stronger for CD163 (0.70) than for CD68 (0.50). Using a cutoff of 25% mean macrophage reactivity and including all patients, a statistically significant difference in overall survival (OS) was seen only for CD163 (P = .0006) and not for CD68 (P = .414). Patients with a mean CD163 reactivity of 25% or more had a median OS of 71 months vs 101 months for patients with less than 25% reactivity. CD163 retained statistical significance in multivariate analysis. In patients with advanced-stage CHL with high IPS, OS was also significantly worse for those with a mean CD163 reactivity of 25% or higher.Our study confirms previous reports of a prognostic role of tumor-infiltrating macrophages in CHL, but only for CD163. Although most of the literature supports an increasing role of macrophage IHC as a predictor of clinical outcome, successful clinical translation will require a standardized method and reporting system.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24515766","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.737516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.661366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.476844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.455374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.371017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.359644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.278049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.177599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"CD68","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD68"},{"name":"Intraclass correlation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraclass_correlation"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"414","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/414"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"International Cricket Council","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Interpretation (logic)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_(logic)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
