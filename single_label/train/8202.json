{"id":8202,"title":"Reprogramming tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells for CD103+ CD8+ mucosal T-cell differentiation and breast cancer rejection.","abstract":"Our studies showed that tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (DC) in breast cancer drive inflammatory Th2 (iTh2) cells and protumor inflammation. Here, we show that intratumoral delivery of the ?-glucan curdlan, a ligand of dectin-1, blocks the generation of iTh2 cells and prevents breast cancer progression in vivo. Curdlan reprograms tumor-infiltrating DCs via the ligation of dectin-1, enabling the DCs to become resistant to cancer-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), to produce IL-12p70, and to favor the generation of Th1 cells. DCs activated via dectin-1, but not those activated with TLR-7/8 ligand or poly I:C, induce CD8+ T cells to express CD103 (?E integrin), a ligand for cancer cells, E-cadherin. Generation of these mucosal CD8+ T cells is regulated by DC-derived integrin ?v?8 and TGF-? activation in a dectin-1-dependent fashion. These CD103+ CD8+ mucosal T cells accumulate in the tumors, thereby increasing cancer necrosis and inhibiting cancer progression in vivo in a humanized mouse model of breast cancer. Importantly, CD103+ CD8+ mucosal T cells elicited by reprogrammed DCs can reject established cancer. Thus, reprogramming tumor-infiltrating DCs represents a new strategy for cancer rejection.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795361","annotations":[{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.862887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.840788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Thymic stromal lymphopoietin","weight":0.803079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymic_stromal_lymphopoietin"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.718219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.610715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.462242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.330911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.156296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.141013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.131806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Glucan","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucan"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.0187256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Humanized antibody","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_antibody"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"}]}
