{"id":60697,"title":"[Clinical features and prognosis of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma].","abstract":"To explore the clinical features and treatments of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.The clinical data of 80 MALT lymphoma patients treated from September 2000 to November 2012 were retrospectively analyzed.Among them, 32 (40.0%) had gastric MALT lymphoma and 48(60.0%) non-gastric MALT lymphoma. Gastric lymphoma associated anemia accounted for 50.0% (16/32) (25.0% (12/48) in non-gastric group, P = 0.022). In non-gastric group, stage III-IV diseases accounted for 35.4% (17/48) (12.5% (4/32) in gastric group, P = 0.022). During a median follow-up of 30 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 90.0% and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate 67.0%. For the non-gastric group, surgery plus chemotherapy group was superior in PFS to surgery alone group (the 3-year PFS rate 83.0% and 33.0%; median PFS 43.4 months and 20.3 months) (P = 0.040). Five-year OS in patients on first-line rituximab and chemotherapy without rituximab were 100.0% and 86.0% respectively (P = 0.106). Short-term response (OR = 0.258, P = 0.020) and low albumin (OR = 3.967, P = 0.009) were independent factor for PFS.Non-gastric MALT lymphoma is easily disseminated. Systemic treatment may be considered for advanced non-gastric MALT lymphoma. Surgery often leaves residual lesions for gastric MALT lymphoma.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844960","annotations":[{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"MALT lymphoma","weight":0.887005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MALT_lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.815354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.588739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.202191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.161245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.150053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0939378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Lymphoid tissue","weight":0.0813588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_tissue"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.065098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Gastric lymphoma","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lymphoma"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1632","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1632"},{"name":"1748","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1748"},{"name":"967","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/967"},{"name":"1248","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1248"},{"name":"258","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/258"},{"name":"IBM PCjr","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PCjr"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucosa-associated_lymphoid_tissue"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
