{"id":60932,"title":"RUNX1 point mutations potentially identify a subset of early immature T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia that may originate from differentiated T-cells.","abstract":"The RUNX1/AML1 gene is among the most frequently mutated genes in human leukaemia. However, its association with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) remains poorly understood. In order to examine RUNX1 point mutations in T-ALL, we conducted an amplicon-based deep sequencing in 65 Southeast Asian childhood patients and 20 T-ALL cell lines, and detected RUNX1 mutations in 6 patients (9.2%) and 5 cell lines (25%). Interestingly, RUNX1-mutated T-ALL cases seem to constitute a subset of early immature T-ALL that may originate from differentiated T-cells. This result provides a deeper insight into the mechanistic basis for leukaemogenesis.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792891","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.842163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.296728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.254042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.157057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"RNA-Seq","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"RUNX1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUNX1"},{"name":"Southeast Asia","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.0208776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"}]}
