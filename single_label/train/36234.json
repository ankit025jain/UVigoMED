{"id":36234,"title":"Endoscopic treatment of a fourth ventricle arachnoid cyst via the third ventricle: a case report.","abstract":"Arachnoid cysts within the fourth ventricle have rarely been reported in the literature. Different procedures have been performed to restore a normal cerebrospinal fluid dynamic or pressure, including shunting and partial or complete excision of the cyst by open microsurgery. Cerebrospinal fluid shunts give only partial improvement of symptoms and are prone to malfunctions. The microsurgical excision of the cyst seems to offer the best chance of success.We report the case of a fourth ventricle arachnoid cyst successfully treated with a complete endoscopic cerebral procedure via the third ventricle.Endoscopic fenestration of fourth ventricle arachnoid cysts may be considered an effective neurosurgical treatment.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589562","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Fourth ventricle","weight":0.87135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_ventricle"},{"name":"Arachnoid cyst","weight":0.832403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnoid_cyst"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.765154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Arachnoid mater","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnoid_mater"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.739911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Third ventricle","weight":0.685863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_ventricle"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.684279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.561534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.459539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.147506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
