{"id":78216,"title":"[Efficacy of nasal packing, septal suture technique and vacuum sealing drainage after nasal septum surgery].","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of nasal packing, septal suture technique and vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) after septoplasty.Ninety patients of nasal septal deviation in Combination with outfracture of the inferior turbinates who had received septoplasty were selected in this study. The patients were allocated into three groups, with thirty in each: for packing group, marcel materials were used for nasal packing after septoplasty; for suturing group, septal suture technique was performed after septoplasty; for VSD group, one drainage tube was used for negative pressure sucking after septoplasty without nasal packing. Postoperative signs and symptoms were compared between three groups. The comfort degree assessment included headache and nasal obstruction were evaluated by using visual analogue scale (VAS) at the 12th hour and 24 hour after operation. The edema in nasal cavity, hemorrhage. abscess,adhesive and healing rates after operation were compared among three groups.The VAS score of headache and nasal obstruction and the severity of patient's conditions were significantly less in septal suture group and VSD group than that in packing group at the 12th and 24th hour after operation. The mucosa edema of nasal cavity was significantly slighter in septal suture group and VSD group than that in packing group at the third day after operation. The healing rates and number of complications are better in septal suture group and VSD group than those in packing group at the 7th day after operation. There were no hemorrhage or abscess in VSD group.Septal suture technique and VSD after septoplasty can significantly relieve the distress of patients and reduce the healing time of mucosa in nasal cavity without increasing the risk of complications.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738317","annotations":[{"name":"Septoplasty","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septoplasty"},{"name":"Nasal septum","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septum"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.742266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.728543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nasal cavity","weight":0.709989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.707927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.615997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.507973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Nasal concha","weight":0.504453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_concha"},{"name":"Nasal septum deviation","weight":0.406715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septum_deviation"},{"name":"Nostril","weight":0.346854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostril"},{"name":"Nasal congestion","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.171631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Suction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Inferior nasal concha","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_nasal_concha"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
