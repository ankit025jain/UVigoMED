{"id":52765,"title":"[Fine-needle aspiration cytology of thyroid nodules: molecular diagnostics in a routine diagnostic setting].","abstract":"Results for the detection of point mutations and rearrangements have thus far been obtained by fresh material of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). After a first retrospective study we report on the diagnostic detection in routinely obtained, consecutive air-dried FNAC smears.RNA and DNA was extracted from 154 consecutive routine air-dried FNAC smears: 80 with microfollicular proliferation (MFP), 45 with follicular neoplasia (FN), 26 with the cytological diagnosis of papillary carcinomas (PTC) and 3 which were suspicious for malignancy. PAX8/PPARG and RET/PTC3 rearrangements were detected by qPCR, while BRAF and RAS point mutations were detected by pyrosequencing.Only 0.7?% and 5.3?% of the routine air-dried FNAC samples did not allow analysis of a point mutation or rearrangements, respectively. NRAS mutations could be detected in 7 MFP smears, and in one of FN and PTC samples, respectively. HRAS mutations were detected in one MPF and one FN sample. A KRAS mutation was only detected in one FN sample, whereas BRAF mutations were detected in 20 samples with PTC (but in no other sample). PAX8/PPARG was detected in 2 MFP samples, while RET/PTC was detected in only one MFP sample. In total, 13.8?% MFP-FNAC, 6.7?% FN-FNAC, and 80.8?% PTC-FNAC samples harbored a mutation.These results demonstrate that rearrangements and point mutations can be detected in routinely obtained air-dried FNAC samples.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570192","annotations":[{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.849646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.827475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.794399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.711219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Follicular thyroid cancer","weight":0.536534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"KRAS","weight":0.508419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.482254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"PAX8","weight":0.456468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAX8"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.363218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.276462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.205324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Pyrosequencing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrosequencing"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor_gamma"},{"name":"Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma_RAS_viral_oncogene_homolog"},{"name":"HRAS","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HRAS"},{"name":"Thyroid nodule","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_nodule"}]}
