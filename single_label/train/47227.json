{"id":47227,"title":"Changes in hepatitis C virus genotype distribution in Japan.","abstract":"Genotypes are associated with the natural course of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and response to antiviral therapy for HCV. HCV genotype 1b has been the dominant genotype in Japan, where the prevention of HCV transmission through blood transfusion or nosocomial infection has been established since 1990. The distribution of HCV genotype was investigated based on patient's birth year in 5515 HCV-infected Japanese individuals at three institutions from different areas of Japan. At all three institutions, the proportion of HCV genotype 1b decreased and was <50% in individuals born after 1970. By contrast, the percentage of HCV genotype 2b increased in subsequent birth cohorts after 1920-1929. Significant changes in HCV genotype distribution were observed across Japan regardless of area.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598252","annotations":[{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.910859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.732203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.660555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.53031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.110637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.027246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"1970","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Natural history of disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history_of_disease"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
