{"id":57016,"title":"Placental pathology associated with small for gestational age infants.","abstract":"Infants with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are at an increased risk of perinatal disease, including death. Many, but not all small for gestational age infants (SGA) have IUGR. Placental disease is an important cause of IUGR, and gross and microscopic examination is critical in explaining such cases. Reports of placentas from infants with a birth weight < 2SD from the mean (approx 3rd centile) born between Jan 2004-Dec 2011 were evaluated. The principal pathology was determined in each case. Where two or more pathologic findings were present, they were ranked as principal and co-existing in terms of severity. There were 69,493 deliveries over the study period. 461 SGA cases were identified. No placenta was available in 44 cases, and 21 cases of known anomalies were excluded, leaving a study group of 396 cases. Pathology potentially causing or contributing to SGA and/or IUGR was identified in 84.1% of cases. Significant co-existing pathology was seen in 88 cases (22%). Placental examination provides key information in understanding abnormal fetal growth.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282971","annotations":[{"name":"Intrauterine growth restriction","weight":0.880709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_growth_restriction"},{"name":"Placenta","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.632187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Eutheria","weight":0.567908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.527546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.520466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Small for gestational age","weight":0.424048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_for_gestational_age"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.0481093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Gross anatomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_anatomy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
