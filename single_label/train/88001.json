{"id":88001,"title":"Distally-based osteocutaneous dorsal metatarsal artery flap for hallux reconstruction.","abstract":"Reconstruction of complex defects of the distal portion of the foot remains a challenging problem for plastic surgeons. A traumatic case is presented where reconstruction of a complex plantar defect of the hallux was achieved using a distally-based osteocutaneous metatarsal artery flap based on the second dorsal metatarsal artery. Local flap repair is a viable reconstructive option for complex defects of the plantar surface of the forefoot.
