{"id":73047,"title":"En bloc hemisacrectomy and internal hemipelvectomy via the posterior approach.","abstract":"Traditionally, hemisacrectomy and internal hemipelvectomy procedures have required both an anterior and a posterior approach. A posterior-only approach has the potential to complete an en bloc tumor resection and spinopelvic reconstruction while reducing surgical morbidity.The authors describe 3 cases in which en bloc resection of the hemisacrum and ilium and subsequent lumbopelvic and pelvic ring reconstruction were performed from a posterior-only approach. Two more traditional anterior and posterior staged procedures are also included for comparison.In all 3 cases, an oncologically appropriate surgery and spinopelvic reconstruction were performed through a posterior-only approach.The advantage of a midline posterior approach is the ability to perform a lumbosacral reconstruction, necessary in cases in which the S-1 body is iatrogenically disrupted during tumor resection.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24926933","annotations":[{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.610087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.593633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.382676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.253035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.211012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0930287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Hemipelvectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemipelvectomy"},{"name":"Sacral spinal nerve 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacral_spinal_nerve_1"},{"name":"Monobloc engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monobloc_engine"},{"name":"Commissure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissure"}]}
