{"id":47236,"title":"[A case of calcifying fibrous tumor in the abdominal wall, morphologically resembling a gastric submucosal tumor].","abstract":"We report an extremely rare case of a calcifying fibrous tumor (CFT) occurring in the abdominal wall. A 43-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of a gastric submucosal tumor. Imaging findings revealed a gastric submucosal tumor with calcification. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration was attempted to obtain a tissue specimen; however, the tumor was not adequately visualized because of calcification. Local excision was performed because of the tumor growth and the risk of progression to gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The tumor was histologically diagnosed as a CFT. We describe the imaging and pathological findings, and discuss the differential diagnosis and histogenesis of CFT.
