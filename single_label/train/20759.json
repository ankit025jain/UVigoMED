{"id":20759,"title":"Host-directed therapy of tuberculosis: what is in it for microRNA?","abstract":"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health threat and current intervention measures are far from satisfactory. MicroRNAs (miRs) have become major targets of investigations for different diseases due to their propensity to regulate gene expression in various biological processes. More recently, miRs have been found to play key roles in the control of infectious diseases. Consequently, the potential of miRs for diagnosis and therapy of TB is being considered. In this editorial, we discuss most recent lines of evidence for regulation of the immune response in TB by miRs that could form the basis for diagnosis and host-directed therapy in adjunct to canonical intervention measures in TB.
