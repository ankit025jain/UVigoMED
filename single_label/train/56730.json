{"id":56730,"title":"Financial return-on-investment of ophthalmic interventions: a new paradigm.","abstract":"Although the patient value gain (improvement in quality-of-life and/or length-of-life) has been highlighted in Value-based Medicine cost-utility analyses, the financial value gain associated with healthcare interventions has received less emphasis. It is important for professional healthcare providers to realize their interventions often confer a large financial return-on-investment (ROI) to society.The societal costs associated with vitreoretinal and other ophthalmic interventions include: direct ophthalmic medical costs expended (hospital, physician, drug, diagnostic testing and so forth), direct medical costs saved (decreased costs for depression, injury, skilled nursing facility, nursing home and others), direct nonmedical costs saved (decreased costs for caregivers, transportation, residence costs, moving costs, and others), and indirect medical costs saved (improving employment incidence and wages). The financial ROI for direct ophthalmic medical costs expended for ranibizumab therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration is 450%, whereas that for cataract surgery is 4500% and for medical open-angle glaucoma therapy is 4000%. Many costs gained add to the Gross Domestic Product and increase the wealth of the nation.Many vitreoretinal and other ophthalmologic interventions confer considerable patient value, but also result in a large financial ROI to society. This financial ROI increases the wealth of the nation.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24638114","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.894133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.701877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.677318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Gross domestic product","weight":0.636602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.628296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.377876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.297916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Republic of Ireland","weight":0.100962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Wage","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Wealth","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Nation","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"}]}
