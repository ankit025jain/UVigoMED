{"id":74017,"title":"Non-viral nanocarriers for siRNA delivery in breast cancer.","abstract":"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in American women. While significant progress has been made in the development of modern diagnostic tools and surgical treatments, only marginal improvements have been achieved with relapsed metastatic breast cancer. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mediate gene silencing of a target protein by disrupting messenger RNAs in an efficient and sequence-specific manner. One application of this technology is the knockdown of genes responsible for tumorigenesis, including those driving oncogenesis, survival, proliferation and death of cells, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, and resistance to treatment. Non-viral nanocarriers have attracted attention based on their potential for targeted delivery of siRNA and efficient gene silencing without toxicity. Here, we review promising, non-viral delivery strategies employing liposomes, nanoparticles and inorganic materials in breast cancer.
