{"id":50458,"title":"Wnt5a influences viability, migration, adhesion, colony formation, E- and N-cadherin expression of human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3.","abstract":"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells express Wnt5a, but its role in ovarian cancer progression is poorly defined. The aims of the present study were two-fold: 1) to determine the Wnt5a role in viability, apoptosis, migration, colony formation and adhesion of human serous epithelial ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3, and 2) to assess the relationship of Wnt5a with E- and N-cadherin in high- and low-grade human serous ovarian cancer specimens. Wnt5a over-expression led to 29% increased serum-independent cell viability (P < 0.05) and 35% decreased caspase-3 activity (P < 0.01) compared to SKOV-3 cells. There was 96% (P < 0.001) increased cell motility in Wnt5a-transfected SKOV-3 (SKOV-3/Wnt5a) cells compared to SKOV-3, which was abrogated in the presence of JNK inhibitor. In addition, there was about 42% increased cell adhesion to Matrigel compared to SKOV-3 cells (P < 0.001). Colony-forming assay showed a 4.4-fold increased colony formation in SKOV-3/Wnt5a cells compared to SKOV-3 cells (P < 0.001). E- and N-cadherin levels were reduced by 49 % and 67 % in SKOV-3/Wnt5a cells compared to mock cells, respectively. Wnt5a and E-cadherin immunoexpression was significantly (P < 0.001) different in low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSC) and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC). In HGSC specimens, strong immunoexpression of Wnt5a was detected compared to LGSC. However, E-cadherin showed moderate immunostaining (84 %) in HGSC, whereas 100 % of LGSC specimens showed strong immunoexpression. In both groups no N-cadherin immunoexpression was detected. Moreover, Wnt5a showed a positive relationship with E-cadherin in the LGSC group (r = 0.661, P = 0.027). These results may support important roles for Wnt5a in EOC progression.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785108","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.813418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Wnt signaling pathway","weight":0.78153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"C-Jun N-terminal kinases","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Jun_N-terminal_kinases"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.673437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.354078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.319121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.233641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.23094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.105451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"}]}
