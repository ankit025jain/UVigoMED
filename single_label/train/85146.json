{"id":85146,"title":"Arterialised earlobe capillary blood gases in the COPD population.","abstract":"Arterialised ear lobe capillary blood (ELCB) gas sampling is a widely used clinical procedure undertaken across both primary and secondary care settings. The prevalence of this sampling method has grown among health professionals, coupled with a growing demand for domiciliary oxygen therapy in the UK, in particular for those who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Research studies supporting arterialised ELCB gas sampling show inconsistencies in technique, and a survey of respiratory nurses' current practice demonstrated wider inconsistencies. In the absence of national clinical guidelines to direct this practice, and an acknowledged and accepted under-calculation of partial pressure of oxygen, this article investigates the sampling method used to obtain arterialised ELCB gas sampling and consequently questions its reliability in practice.
