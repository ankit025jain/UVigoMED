{"id":24334,"title":"Photodynamic chemotherapy in the treatment of superficial mycoses: an evidence-based evaluation.","abstract":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a constantly evolving treatment modality consisted of a chemical reaction activated by light energy that is used to selectively destroy tissue; it may be considered a particular form of photochemotherapy that uses a photosensitizer, light and oxygen. The combination of the possibility of ablation of lesion with an excellence aesthetic result has allowed the photodynamic therapy an increasing role in the treatment of skin disease, that ranges from skin cancer to cosmetic treatment. Particular attention is paid in the last years to a developing area of research, the antifungal photodynamic therapy. The growing resistance against antifungal drugs has renewed the search for alternative therapies and PDT seems to be a potential candidate. This article provides an extensive review of antifungal photodynamic therapy, its mechanisms and applications in the treatment of superficial mycoses.
