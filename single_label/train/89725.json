{"id":89725,"title":"An evaluation of reading comprehension of expository text in adults with traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"This project was conducted to obtain information about reading problems of adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairments and to investigate how these readers respond to reading comprehension strategy prompts integrated into digital versions of text.Participants from 2 groups, adults with TBI (n = 15) and matched controls (n = 15), read 4 different 500-word expository science passages linked to either a strategy prompt condition or a no-strategy prompt condition. The participants' reading comprehension was evaluated using sentence verification and free recall tasks.The TBI and control groups exhibited significant differences on 2 of the 5 reading comprehension measures: paraphrase statements on a sentence verification task and communication units on a free recall task. Unexpected group differences were noted on the participants' prerequisite reading skills. For the within-group comparison, participants showed significantly higher reading comprehension scores on 2 free recall measures: words per communication unit and type-token ratio. There were no significant interactions.The results help to elucidate the nature of reading comprehension in adults with TBI with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairments and endorse further evaluation of reading comprehension strategies as a potential intervention option for these individuals. Future research is needed to better understand how individual differences influence a person's reading and response to intervention.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687229","annotations":[{"name":"Science","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.689373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.298912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.250838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.194999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Word","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Individual differences psychology","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_differences_psychology"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Response to intervention","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_to_intervention"},{"name":"Free recall","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_recall"},{"name":"Reading education in the United States","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_education_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Reading disability","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_disability"},{"name":"Reading comprehension","weight":0.0175845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_comprehension"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Paraphrase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrase"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Falsifiability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Recall (memory)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_(memory)"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Sentence (linguistics)","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"}]}
