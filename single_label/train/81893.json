{"id":81893,"title":"The reliability of computerized condylar path angle assessment.","abstract":"Recording the track of the mandibular hinge axis and consequently ascertaining the posterior determinants is one of the key requirements for accurately simulating individual oral conditions in the (virtual) articulator. The aim of this study was to determine the reliability of computerized condylar path inclination angle (CPIA) measures and to assess whether the reliability depends on the mandibular dentition. Sagittal and transverse CPIA were measured using computerized axiography (Cadiax Compact 2) at two separate sessions in prosthodontic patients (mean age +/- SD: 64.3 +/- 10.3 years; female: 45%) who were classified into three dentition categories (fully dentate: N = 19, partially dentate: N = 27 and edentulous: N = 19). These measurements were repeated three times at both sessions without removing the computerized axiograph. Reliability was assessed in multilevel analyses using the subject as a grouping variable in linear random-intercept models. Considering all assessment procedures, the patient-specific differences explained 75% of the variance for the sagittal and 38% for the transverse condylar path. This corresponds to the overall reliability of both the sagittal and the transverse CPIA assessment. The dentition had no significant impact on the reliability of the measurements. The sagittal CPIA can be assessed with satisfactory reliability using computerized axiography. It is independent of the status of the dentition, which has no statistically significant impact on the measures. Transverse CPIA measurements have shown poor reliability. Therefore, the electronic determination of the sagittal CPIA is a reliable procedure that can be applied in patients irrespective of the status of the mandibular dentition.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791464","annotations":[{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.312422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.296343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.250019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.141683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.103354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Prosthodontics","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthodontics"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Track and field","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Hinge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinge"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Compact (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Articulator","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulator"},{"name":"Inclination","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"},{"name":"Coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system"},{"name":"Railways Act 1921","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railways_Act_1921"},{"name":"Transverse plane","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_plane"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Condylar canal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condylar_canal"}]}
