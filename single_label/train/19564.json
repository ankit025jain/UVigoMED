{"id":19564,"title":"[Limitations of medicine:diagnosis and therapy of <<inflammatory>> back pain].","abstract":"A 34-year-old man from Ethiopia had been suffering from inflammatory lower backpain for five months. The imaging showed multiple osteolytic lesions histologically corresponding to a granulomatous inflammation. Detection of multiresistant Mycobacteria Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was delayed because of initially negative microbiological findings. During the therapy of MDR-TB, the patient developed different side effects. In this article we focus on the challenge to diagnose and treat MDR-TB also in a resource-rich setting as it is the case for Switzerland.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712089","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.767928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.708148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.68333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.419532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.392724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Ethiopia","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Osteolysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolysis"}]}
