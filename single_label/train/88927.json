{"id":88927,"title":"[Therapeutic options for reconstruction of the dorsal trunk wall].","abstract":"Posterior trunk defects represent a major reconstructive problem, which require the entire armamentarium of the reconstructive surgeon. Given the special anatomy of the back, flap selection includes transposition flaps, perforator flaps, muscle flaps, turn-over flaps and free flaps, eventually with interposition of vein grafts. The majority of the defects can be closed with pedicled muscle or musculocutaneous flaps. In our patient collective, sufficient closure could be obtained with all procedures, except the latissimus dorsi turn-over flap. Based on our clinical experience, we propose an algorithm for closure of posterior trunk defects related to the anatomical region.
