{"id":64488,"title":"Decoy receptor 3 suppresses B cell functions and has a negative correlation with disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis.","abstract":"The decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) is a member of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily and may regulate inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of DcR3 in B cell functions and its correlation to disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).The concentrations of DcR3 and TNF-? were measured by ELISA. B cell proliferation was assessed by quantification of 3H-thymidine uptake. Staphylococcus aureus Cowan (SAC) strain were used to stimulate B cell proliferation and TNF-? production.Compared to the osteoarthritis (OA) patients, the RA group had higher synovial DcR3 levels (3273.6±1623.2 vs. 1594.8±1190.0 pg/ml, p=0.003), which were negatively correlated with the serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate and Disease Activity Score using 28 joint counts (DAS28) scores (r=-0.560, p=0.002; r=-0.579, p<0.001, respectively). Although the RA B cells have more active characteristics, B cell proliferation induced by SAC was successfully suppressed by recombinant DcR3.Fc fusion protein with an average inhibition of 44.8%. Moreover, DcR3.Fc fusion protein was found to suppress SAC-induced TNF-? production by B cells in 8 RA patients (average inhibition 47.0%).The results of our study indicated that the inhibition of B cell functions by DcR3 may partially explain the negative correlation between DcR3 level and disease activity in RA patients. Our findings imply that DcR3 may be used as a biomarker for disease activity and a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of RA.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25084482","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.878899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.870536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.650072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.632454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor","weight":0.579912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.515163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.338395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Fragment crystallizable region","weight":0.221289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_crystallizable_region"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
