{"id":15220,"title":"Childhood leprosy in the post-elimination phase: data from a tertiary health care hospital in the Karnataka state of south India.","abstract":"Children with leprosy attending a tertiary care hospital during the post-elimination period, in the Karnataka state of south India, have been studied. Data on childhood leprosy collected by the field health workers from district leprosy office during the same period through community survey was also analysed.In the hospital, 61 new childhood cases were diagnosed, 19.7% of the total leprosy cases (n = 309) examined during that period. Borderline tuberculoid leprosy was the commonest presentation in children. Twenty four (39.34%) were paucibacillary and 37 (60.65%) were multi-bacillary. Positive slit skin smear was obtained in 8.19%. Household contacts were identified in 18.2%. Reactions were seen in 16.4% (type 1 and 2) and 8.19% children had visible deformity. Analysis of the data collected by the field health workers showed 223 (21.25%) childhood cases (paucibacillary 69.50% and multi-bacillary 30.49%). Type 1 reaction was recorded in 4.93%. Deformities were seen in 5.82%, and 1.79% had WHO Grade 2 deformities.More multi-bacillary cases were recorded in the hospital as compared to higher number of pauci-bacillary cases by the community survey. Cases with reactions and deformities were also higher in hospital. Type 2 reaction was not recorded in community survey and WHO Grade 2 deformities were low. Patients with more severe disease might have attended the hospital by choice, resulting in the difference in data. The results indicate that transmission of leprosy is continuing in India even in this state with low endemicity. Presence of household contacts, children with multi-bacillary disease and smear positivity in childhood cases are the aspects requiring special attention.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25255612","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.497748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.484328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"India","weight":0.344834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.338059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.26127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.171842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.168951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Karnataka","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.0738637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Tuberculoid leprosy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculoid_leprosy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"223","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/223"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"States and territories of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_India"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"God","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"},{"name":"Graded stakes race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"}]}
