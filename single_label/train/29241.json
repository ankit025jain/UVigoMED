{"id":29241,"title":"Frictional purpuric eruption associated with angiotensin II receptor blockers.","abstract":"Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are drugs generally well tolerated. There are few reports about cutaneous side effects of ARBs. The present authors describe herein four cases of purpuric eruption mainly involving sites of friction in patients taking ARBs. These eruptions completely cleared after stopping the drug and implementing preservative measures to reduce friction.
