{"id":38872,"title":"[Prenatal screening and diagnosis of severe congenital heart defects in Finland].","abstract":"Careful investigation of the heart for finding structural heart defects is an essential part of nationwide fetal anomaly screening at 20th weeks of gestation which took effect in 2010.We studied the results of fetal cardiac screening in infants having a major congenital cardiac defect in 2005-2011.28% of severe cardiac defects were detected prenatally. Univentricular heart defects were prenatally found in 87% of all cases. Screening for transposition of great arteries and conotruncal defects remains challenging.More active approach with a rapid referral is recommended for abnormal cardiac findings in fetal structural screening.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397149","annotations":[{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.693139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.597475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.340539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Great arteries","weight":0.207234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_arteries"},{"name":"Transposon","weight":0.0229109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposon"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Active learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning"},{"name":"Bulbus cordis","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbus_cordis"}]}
