{"id":91797,"title":"Ultrasonography screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms: a systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.","abstract":"Long-term follow-up of population-based randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) has demonstrated that screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) measuring 3 cm or greater decreases AAA-related mortality rates in men aged 65 years or older.To systematically review evidence about the benefits and harms of ultrasonography screening for AAAs in asymptomatic primary care patients.MEDLINE, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2004 through January 2013), clinical trial registries, reference lists, experts, and a targeted bridge search for population-based screening RCTs through September 2013.English-language, population-based, fair- to good-quality RCTs and large cohort studies for AAA screening benefits as well as RCTs and cohort and registry studies for harms in adults with AAA.Dual quality assessment and abstraction of study details and results.Reviews of 4 RCTs involving 137,214 participants demonstrated that 1-time invitation for AAA screening in men aged 65 years or older reduced AAA rupture and AAA-related mortality rates for up to 10 and 15 years, respectively, but had no statistically significant effect on all-cause mortality rates up to 15 years. Screening was associated with more overall and elective surgeries but fewer emergency operations and lower 30-day operative mortality rates at up to 10- to 15-year follow-up. One RCT involving 9342 women showed that screening had no benefit on AAA-related or all-cause mortality rates.Trials included mostly white men outside of the United States. Information for subgroups and about rescreening was limited.One-time invitation for AAA screening in men aged 65 years or older was associated with decreased AAA rupture and AAA-related mortality rates but had little or no effect on all-cause mortality rates.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473919","annotations":[{"name":"United States Preventive Services Task Force","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Preventive_Services_Task_Force"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.793689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.674322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.584469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.504304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.49659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.445958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.323049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"},{"name":"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_for_Healthcare_Research_and_Quality"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Central Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
