{"id":47730,"title":"Meta-analysis of immunohistochemical expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1? as a prognostic role in gastric cancer.","abstract":"To conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic role of hypoxia inducible factor-1? (HIF-1?) expression in gastric cancer.The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched systematically for all articles published in English before August, 2013. Pooled effect was calculated from the available data to evaluate the association between HIF-1? expression and 5-year overall survival and tumor clinicopathological features in gastric cancer patients. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95%CIs were calculated using either a fixed-effects or a random-effects model.Nine studies matched the selection criteria, which reported on 1103 subjects, 548 of whom had HIF-1? positive expression (50%). This meta-analysis indicated that HIF-1? positive expression in gastric cancer correlated with lower 5-year overall survival (OR = 0.36; 95%CI: 0.21-0.64), worse tumor differentiation (OR = 0.38; 95%CI: 0.23-0.64), deeper invasion (OR = 0.42; 95%CI: 0.32-0.57), higher rates of lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.23; 95%CI: 1.46-3.40), lymphatic invasion (OR = 2.50; 95%CI: 1.46-4.28), and vascular invasion (OR = 1.80; 95%CI: 1.29-2.51), and higher TNM stage (III + IV) (OR = 0.31; 95%CI: 0.15-0.60).HIF-1? positive expression indicates a poor prognosis for patients with gastric cancer. Further studies are required to confirm these results.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574785","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.752197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.657429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.425341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.368006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.214233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.186121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Hypoxia-inducible factors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0227032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"}]}
