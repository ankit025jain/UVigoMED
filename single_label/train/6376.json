{"id":6376,"title":"Eluding anaphylaxis allows peptide-specific prevention of the relapsing stage of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.","abstract":"We have used a peptide derived from Acanthamoeba castellanii (ACA) to treat the relapsing phase of EAE that develops in SJL mice following immunization with the PLP 139-151 peptide. The native sequence of the ACA 81-95 peptide that shares key residues with the PLP 139-151 peptide is weakly encephalitogenic in SJL mice but is not recognized by antiserum from SJL mice immunized with PLP 139-151. A single amino acid change to the ACA 81-95 peptide sequence significantly enhanced its encephalitogenicity. When administered to SJL mice as a nonlinear peptide octamer, the modified ACA peptide prevented relapsing episodes of EAE in SJL mice previously immunized with the PLP 139-151 encephalitogenic peptide.
