{"id":13386,"title":"Reduced expression of Phospholipase C beta in hippocampal interneuron during pilocarpine induced status epilepticus in mice.","abstract":"We investigated localization of Phospholipase C beta (PLC?1 and PLC?4) in laminaes of dorsal hippocampus and different subtypes of hippocampal interneurons in normal Kunming mouse, and their progressive changes during pilocarpine induced status epilepticus (SE) by quantitative immunohistochemistry and real time PCR. PLC?1 was observed in the pyramidal layer of CA1-3 area, hilus of the dentate gyrus, whereas PLC?4 was mainly expressed in calcium binding protein positive interneurons, i.e. calbindin, calretinin, parvalbumin positive interneurons in the strata oriens, radiatum of the CA area and hilus of the dentate gyrus. During pilocarpine induced SE, a temporary down-regulation of PLC?4 in the interneurons of CA area at SE 30min, and a progressive reduction of PLC?1/PLC?4 in dentate hilar cells were demonstrated. These findings confirm and extend the regional specific distribution of PLC?1 and PLC?4 immunoreactivity in mouse hippocampus, and suggest that PLC?1 and PLC?4 may play an important role in maintenance of the status epilepticus.
