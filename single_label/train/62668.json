{"id":62668,"title":"Romiplostim for severe thrombocytopenia in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection: a new option for clinicians?","abstract":"We describe a case of a 64-year-old man with a history of ITP which had required several treatments including splenectomy, and with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection untreated due to severe thrombocytopenia. In March 2011, platelet count was 14,000/mmc and a thrombopoietic therapy with romiplostim was initiated at the dose of 2 mcg/kg/week that was increased to 8 mcg/kg/week. At week 32, platelet count was 65,000/mmc and an anti-HCV therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin was then started. At baseline laboratory tests indicated AST 99IU/l, ALT 125UI/l, HCV_RNA 3,220 UI/ml and HCV genotype 2a/2c. An early virological response (EVR) with normalization of transaminases in the course of antiviral therapy, such as a sustained virological response (SVR) after its interruption were recorded. Therefore a satisfactory platelet count (range 54.000-179.000/mmc) at the dose of 4 mcg/week during antiviral therapy, such as at the dose of 2 mcg/kg/week after antiviral interruption (range 65.000-292.000/mmc) was recorded. Romiplostim proved effective and safe in the course of antiviral treatment. Therefore it permitted the start of anti-HCV therapy despite severe thrombocytopenia and also avoided any peg-interferon dosage modification or discontinuation. Further prospective studies in larger patient cohort should be encouraged to validate this strategy.
