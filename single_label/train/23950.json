{"id":23950,"title":"High-dose regimen to achieve novel target trough concentration in teicoplanin.","abstract":"In the treatment of severe MRSA infections such as endocarditis, more than 20 mg/L of plasma trough concentration (C(min)) is recommended for teicoplanin; however, in the treatment of common MRSA infections, recommended C(min) remains more than 10 mg/L. In this study, we set C(min) as 15-30 mg/L to obtain a favorable clinical outcome in the treatment of common MRSA infections, and investigated the optimal loading regimen that achieved the target C(min) in patients with normal renal function. Seventy-eight patients received the high-dose regimen A (6 mg/kg every 12-h for initial two days) and 60 patients received the high-dose regimen B (the first five loading doses of 10-12 mg/kg at 12-h intervals for initial three days, followed by 6 mg/kg once daily). The mean C(min) on the 4th day was 13.7 ± 5.3 mg/L in regimen A, and 20.0 ± 6.6 mg/L in regimen B (P < 0.001), and the proportion of patients achieving the 15-30 mg/L was 25.6% and 68.3% (P < 0.001). Clinical response at end-of treatment were 66.7% and 85.0% (P = 0.014). The patients of initial C(min) with ?15 mg/L had tended to be higher clinical response than those with <15 mg/L (80.9% vs 68.6%, P = 0.084). There were no significant differences in the occurrence of adverse effects in regimen A and B (nephrotoxicity; 1.3% vs 3.3%, P = 0.413, hepatotoxicity; 5.1% vs 3.3%, P = 0.608). In conclusion, to obtain C(min) 15-30 mg/L, the first five loading doses of 10-12 mg/kg at 12-h intervals was required in patients with normal renal function.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462424","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.721372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.634643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.532061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.470048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.334465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.263889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Teicoplanin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teicoplanin"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"1012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1012"},{"name":"1530","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1530"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 6","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_6"},{"name":"Trough (meteorology)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)"}]}
