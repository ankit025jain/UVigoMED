{"id":76064,"title":"[Risk factors and development of metabolic disorders in workers of \"Uralasbest\" enterprise].","abstract":"The authors evaluated possible increase in metabolic disorders risk in workers exposed to natural asbestos and to mixed asbestos stock dust, on the background of improper nutrition. Findings are excessive intake of food with high content of free sugar, saturated fatty acids and common salt (2.3-11.0 times) with lack of chicken meat, cereals, fish, vegetables, fruits and cultured milk foods in diet. Excessive body weight was seen in 81.0% of the workers, every third worker was obese. Chances ratio proved that the workers with excessive body weight are more probable in developing high serum levels of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerids, low density lipoproteins, higher atherogenicity index (2.4-3.1 times), and probability of arterial hypertension is higher by 78%.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
