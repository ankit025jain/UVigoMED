{"id":41230,"title":"Unilateral nevoid telangiectasia syndrome (UNTS) associated with chronic hepatitis C virus and positive immunoreactivity for VEGF.","abstract":"Unilateral Nevoid Telangectasia Syndrome (UNTS) is characterized by superficial telangiectasias in a unilateral distribution. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may play a role in the pathogenesis of UNTS in patients with underlying hepatic disease. We report a case of a patient with UNTS accompanied by chronic hepatitis C virus infection, with a normal serum estrogen profile and strong positive immunohistochemical staining of lesional skin with VEGF.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24945644","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Telangiectasia","weight":0.752243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangiectasia"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Nevus","weight":0.533195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevus"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.463361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.443286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.315213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
