{"id":77079,"title":"Serum retinol concentrations in mothers and newborns at delivery in a public maternity hospital in Recife, northeast Brazil.","abstract":"Serum retinol concentrations were compared in a consecutive series of 65 mother-newborn pairs at delivery in a public maternity hospital in Recife, Brazil, from January to August 2008 and examined their association with biological, socioeconomic, environmental and obstetrical characteristics. Serum retinol concentrations of the newborns (umbilical cord) and mothers (brachial venipuncture) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Prevalence of low (< 0.70 micromol/L) and inadequate (< 1.05 micromol/L) serum retinol concentrations were observed in 23.1% (95% CI 13.9-35.5) and 23.0% (95% CI 13.5-35.8) among newborns and mothers respectively. The serum retinol distribution was lower in male than female infants (-0.4 micromol/L, p = 0.01) and, across both sexes, concentrations in paired newborn and mother were correlated (r = 0.27, p = 0.04). Further, maternal status explains only 7% of the variance in retinol concentrations in newborn's cord plasma. Among mothers delivering in public facilities in Recife, hypovitaminosis may exist.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847590","annotations":[{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.788923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.673266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.669436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.580896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.424409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Maternity","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Retinol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinol"},{"name":"Recife","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"535","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/535"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"935","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/935"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Pair bond","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_bond"},{"name":"Northeast Region, Brazil","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Region,_Brazil"}]}
