{"id":58421,"title":"Concise review for physicians and other clinicians: postpartum depression.","abstract":"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common, potentially disabling, and, in some cases, life-threatening condition. Fortunately, PPD is also readily detectable in routine practice and is amenable to treatment by a wide variety of modalities that are effective for treating nonpuerperal major depression. Postpartum depression screening can improve case identification (an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of ? 13 indicates a high risk of PPD) and, when associated with a diagnostic and follow-up program, leads to improved clinical outcomes. Symptom severity, patient preference, past response to treatment, availability of local mental health care resources, and patient decisions about breast-feeding will drive management decisions. In general, cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy are preferred psychotherapies for women with mild to moderate PPD, whereas antidepressants are appropriate in more severe cases. Many patients will require other types of assistance, such as parenting support, case management, or care coordination because many barriers to receiving adequate PPD treatment must still be overcome.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24943697","annotations":[{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.811497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Interpersonal psychotherapy","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_psychotherapy"},{"name":"Postpartum depression","weight":0.79675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.741221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Mental health professional","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health_professional"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.6387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.527023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.452922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Motor coordination","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination"},{"name":"Parenting","weight":0.302953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.2922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.213163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.153892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0418302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Edinburgh","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Identification (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_(psychology)"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Physical attractiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness"},{"name":"Medical case management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_case_management"},{"name":"Liberalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"},{"name":"Case management (mental health)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_management_(mental_health)"}]}
