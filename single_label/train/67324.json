{"id":67324,"title":"NRP-1 expression in bladder cancer and its implications for tumor progression.","abstract":"Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) overexpression has been reported in a variety of human cancers. However, the role of NRP-1 in bladder cancer (BC) remains unclear. The aim of present study was to analyze NRP-1 protein expression in BC tissues and to assess its prognostic significance for BC. NRP-1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression were determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry in specimens of primary cancer and their adjacent noncancerous tissues in BC patients. Additionally, NRP-1 protein expression in 139 archived paraffin-embedded BC samples was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and survival. Student's t test, Spearman's rank correlation, Kaplan-Meier plots, and Cox's proportional hazards regression model were used to analyze the data. By qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, the levels of NRP-1 mRNA and protein were significantly higher in BC, compared to that in adjacent noncancerous tissues (P<0.001). High expression of NRP-1 was significantly associated with histologic grade (P=0.016) and tumor stage (P=0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that high expression of NRP-1 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Our study suggests that overexpression of NRP-1 may play an important role in the progression of BC, and NRP-1 expression may serve as a biomarker for poor prognosis for BC.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627131","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.749777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.736605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.701459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.694577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.672903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.424789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.295212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.201351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.167611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.128219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
