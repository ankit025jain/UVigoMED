{"id":78433,"title":"Identification of human tissue kallikrein 6 as a potential marker of laryngeal cancer based on the relevant secretory/releasing protein database.","abstract":"This study was aimed to create a large-scale laryngeal cancer relevant secretory/releasing protein database and further discover candidate biomarkers.Primary tissue cultures were established using tumor tissues and matched normal mucosal tissues collected from four laryngeal cancer patients. Serum-free conditioned medium (CM) samples were collected. These samples were then sequentially processed by SDS-PAGE separation, trypsin digestion, and LC-MS/MS analysis. The candidates in the database were validated by ELISA using plasma samples from laryngeal cancer patients, benign patients, and healthy individuals.Combining MS data from the tumor tissues and normal tissues, 982 proteins were identified in total; extracellular proteins and cell surface proteins accounted for 15.0% and 4.3%, respectively. According to stringent criteria, 49 proteins were selected as candidates worthy of further validation. Of these, human tissue kallikrein 6 (KLK6) was verified. The level of KLK6 was significantly increased in the plasma samples from the cancer cohort compared to the benign and healthy cohorts and moreover showed a slight decrease in the postoperative plasma samples in comparison to the preoperative plasma samples.This laryngeal cancer-derived protein database provides a promising repository of candidate blood biomarkers for laryngeal cancer. The diagnostic potential of KLK6 deserves further investigation.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669031","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Trypsin","weight":0.831215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypsin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.768176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.53923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.527876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.511326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Kallikrein","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kallikrein"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.32337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.143036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Sequence database","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_database"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Laryngeal cancer","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_cancer"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"}]}
