{"id":43357,"title":"Interleukin-10 receptor signaling in innate immune cells regulates mucosal immune tolerance and anti-inflammatory macrophage function.","abstract":"Intact interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) signaling on effector and T regulatory (Treg) cells are each independently required to maintain immune tolerance. Here we show that IL-10 sensing by innate immune cells, independent of its effects on T cells, was critical for regulating mucosal homeostasis. Following wild-type (WT) CD4(+) T cell transfer, Rag2(-/-)Il10rb(-/-) mice developed severe colitis in association with profound defects in generation and function of Treg cells. Moreover, loss of IL-10R signaling impaired the generation and function of anti-inflammatory intestinal and bone-marrow-derived macrophages and their ability to secrete IL-10. Importantly, transfer of WT but not Il10rb(-/-) anti-inflammatory macrophages ameliorated colitis induction by WT CD4(+) T cells in Rag2(-/-)Il10rb(-/-) mice. Similar alterations in the generation and function of anti-inflammatory macrophages were observed in IL-10R-deficient patients with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Collectively, our studies define innate immune IL-10R signaling as a key factor regulating mucosal immune homeostasis in mice and humans.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792912","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.857164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.817574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immune tolerance","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_tolerance"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.734292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.687173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.683224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.538042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.513024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.255407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.243501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
