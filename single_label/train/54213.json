{"id":54213,"title":"Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy to treat solid pseudopapillary tumors in children: transition from open to laparoscopic approaches in suitable cases.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of open and laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) in the treatment of solid pseudopapillary tumors (SPT) in children.This was a retrospective study of 22 patients under 18 years of age who underwent a distal pancreatectomy for SPT between January 1995 and December 2012.Fourteen patients and eight patients underwent LDP and open distal pancreatectomy (ODP), respectively, and 71.4 % of the LDP and 25.0 % of the ODP procedures were spleen-sparing operations. The median duration of surgery in the LDP group was shorter than that in the ODP group [175 (range 120-540) vs. 257 (range 200-305) min, p = 0.024]. There were no differences in postoperative complications. The LDP patients commenced oral intake earlier than the ODP patients [2.0 (range 1.0-7.0) vs. 4.0 (range 3.0-12.0) days, p = 0.010], and had an earlier discharge from hospital [7.0 (range 5.0-20.0) vs. 13.0 (range 7.0-22.0) days, p = 0.009].LDP treatment for SPT in children is associated with a shorter hospitalization and a shorter time to oral intake compared to ODP. LDP is a safe and feasible option for SPT in select pediatric patients.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468715","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.61914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.416493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.374893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Pancreatectomy","weight":0.368056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatectomy"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0726324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0713771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0677463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"257","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/257"},{"name":"Transitioning (transgender)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitioning_(transgender)"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democratic_Party_(Japan)"},{"name":"Strathclyde Partnership for Transport","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathclyde_Partnership_for_Transport"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Open Directory Project","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Directory_Project"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
