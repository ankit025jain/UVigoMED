{"id":43823,"title":"RNA sequencing shows transcriptomic changes in rectosigmoid mucosa in patients with irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea: a pilot case-control study.","abstract":"Our aim was to conduct a pilot case-control study of RNA expression profile using RNA sequencing of rectosigmoid mucosa of nine females with -diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) with accelerated colonic transit and nine female healthy controls. Mucosal total RNA was isolated and purified, and next-generation pair-end sequencing was performed using Illumina TruSeq. Analysis was carried out using a targeted approach toward 12 genes previously associated with IBS and a hypothesis-generating approach. Of the 12 targeted genes tested, patients with IBS-D had decreased mRNA expression of TNFSF15 (fold change controls to IBS-D: 1.53, P = 0.01). Overall, up- and downregulated mRNA expressions of 21 genes (P = 10(-5) to 10(-8); P values with false detection rates are shown) were potentially relevant to IBS-D including the following: neurotransmitters [P2RY4 (P = 0.001), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP, P = 0.02)]; cytokines [CCL20 (P = 0.019)]; immune function [C4BPA complement cascade (P = 0.0187)]; interferon-related [IFIT3 (P = 0.016)]; mucosal repair and cell adhesion [trefoil protein (TFF1, P = 0.012)], retinol binding protein [RBP2 (P = 0.017)]; fibronectin (FN1, P = 0.009); and ion channel functions [guanylate cyclase (GUCA2B, P = 0.017), PDZ domain-containing protein 3 (PDZD3, P = 0.029)]. Ten genes associated with functions related to pathobiology of IBS-D were validated by RT-PCR. There was significant correlation in fold changes of the selected genes (Rs = 0.73, P = 0.013). Up- or downregulation of P2RY4, GUC2AB, RBP2, FNI, and C4BPA genes were confirmed on RT-PCR, which also revealed upregulation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and apical sodium-coupled bile acid transporter (IBAT/ASBT). RNA-Seq and RT-PCR analysis of rectosigmoid mucosa in IBS-D show transcriptome changes that provide the rationale for validation studies to explore the role of mucosal factors in the pathobiology of IBS-D.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763552","annotations":[{"name":"Irritable bowel
