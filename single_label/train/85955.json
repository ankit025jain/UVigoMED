{"id":85955,"title":"Leukocytes require ADAM10 but not ADAM17 for their migration and inflammatory recruitment into the alveolar space.","abstract":"Inflammation is a key process in various diseases, characterized by leukocyte recruitment to the inflammatory site. This study investigates the role of a disintegrin and a metalloproteinase (ADAM) 10 and ADAM17 for leukocyte migration in vitro and in a murine model of acute pulmonary inflammation. Inhibition experiments or RNA knockdown indicated that monocytic THP-1 cells and primary human neutrophils require ADAM10 but not ADAM17 for efficient chemokine-induced cell migration. Signaling and adhesion events that are linked to cell migration such as p38 and ? GTPase-family activation, F-actin polymerization, adhesion to fibronectin, and up-regulation of ?5 integrin were also dependent on ADAM10 but not ADAM17. This was confirmed with leukocytes isolated from mice lacking either ADAM10 or ADAM17 in all hematopoietic cells (vav 1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor [Vav]-Adam10(-/-) or Vav-Adam17(-/-) mice). In lipopolysaccharide-induced acute pulmonary inflammation, alveolar recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes was transiently increased in Vav-Adam17(-/-) but steadily reduced in Vav-Adam10(-/-) mice. This deficit in alveolar leukocyte recruitment was also observed in LysM-Adam10(-/-) mice lacking ADAM10 in myeloid cells and correlated with protection against edema formation. Thus, with regard to leukocyte migration, leukocyte-expressed ADAM10 but not ADAM17 displays proinflammatory activities and may therefore serve as a target to limit inflammatory cell recruitment.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24833351","annotations":[{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Fibronectin","weight":0.862391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibronectin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Guanine nucleotide exchange factor","weight":0.814906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine_nucleotide_exchange_factor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.795339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.765589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.750663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.742385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Polymerization","weight":0.606567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.569264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.550277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.402232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.281229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Myelocyte","weight":0.102975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelocyte"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Disintegrin","weight":0.0732274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disintegrin"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0583333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"ADAM17","weight":0.0547007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADAM17"},{"name":"ADAM10","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADAM10"},{"name":"P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","weight":0.0248623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Signal (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(physiology)"},{"name":"A disintegrin and metalloproteinase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_disintegrin_and_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
