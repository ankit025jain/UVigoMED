{"id":62801,"title":"Antitumour activity of Sargassum wightii (Greville) extracts against Dalton's ascites lymphoma.","abstract":"Seaweeds have been used by mankind as medicine and food for more than 13,000 years. Marine algae are considered to produce a valuable phytoconstituents characterized by a broad spectrum of antitumor activities. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of different solvent extracts of Sargassum wightii, Greville against Dalton's Ascitic Lymphoma (DAL) in Swiss male albino mice. DAL cells were injected intraperitoneally 1 x10(6) cell to the mice. Two days after cells injection the animals were treated with different solvent extracts of Sargassum wightii at dose of 200 mg kg(-1) for 14 days. 5-fluorouracil (20 mg kg(-1)) was used as reference drug. On day 11, cancer cell number, packed cell volume, decrease in tumour weight of the mice, increase in life span and hematological parameters were evaluated and compared with the same parameters in control. A significant increase in the life span and a decrease in the cancer cell number and tumour weight were noted in the tumour-induced mice after treatment with the extract. The haematological parameters were also normalized by the ethanolic and chloroform extracts in tumour-induced mice. These observations are suggestive of the protective effect of ethanolic extract of Sargassum wightii is comparatively better than other two tested extracts against Dalton's Ascitic Lymphoma (DAL).","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511743","annotations":[{"name":"Chloroform","weight":0.90416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.902289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Algae","weight":0.873318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.775615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.720071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Solvent","weight":0.663545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"},{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.529262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Seaweed","weight":0.371848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.334165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.330205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.308367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.214399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.186121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"United States Marine Corps","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps"},{"name":"Sargassum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargassum"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"}]}
