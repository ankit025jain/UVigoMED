{"id":42763,"title":"Surgical resection of peritoneal or thoracoabdominal wall implants from hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"Peritoneal or thoracoabdominal wall implants from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occur occasionally after biopsy, percutaneous therapy or resection, and spontaneously, with no effective treatment available. The objective of this study was to clarify the indications for, and benefits of, surgical resection of such HCC implants.This was a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent resection for peritoneal or chest wall implants from HCC over 14?years (1997-2011). Indications for surgery for implanted HCC were: limited number of implanted lesions including those found incidentally during surgery; intrahepatic lesion absent or predicted to be locally controllable; and absence of ascites with sufficient hepatic functional reserve. Prognostic factors affecting survival after resection were determined by univariable and multivariable analysis.A total of 32 patients underwent 36 resections. Cumulative 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 71, 44 and 39 per cent respectively, with a median survival time of 34.5?months. Univariable and multivariable analysis revealed that poor perioperative intrahepatic disease control was associated with poor survival.Surgical resection of implanted HCC may improve long-term survival in selected patients as long as intrahepatic disease is absent or well controlled.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828028","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.660797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Thoracic wall","weight":0.524889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_wall"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.515082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.448347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.265155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.10793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Indication (medicine)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0479091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0150283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
