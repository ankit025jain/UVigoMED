{"id":67921,"title":"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1? C1772T polymorphism and cancer risk: a meta-analysis including 18,334 subjects.","abstract":"Studies on HIF 1? C1772T (P582S) polymorphism revealed a genetic susceptibility to malignant tumors, however, the results were conflicting. We conducted a meta-analysis utilizing 29 eligible case-control studies to analyze the data concerning the association between the HIF-1? C1772T polymorphism and cancer risks. There was statistical association between the HIF-1? CT/TT genotype and cancer risk (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.06-1.54, P(heterogeneity) < .00001). The stability of these observations was confirmed by a one-way sensitivity analysis. Our findings suggested that CT/TT genotype was associated with increased risks of prostate cancer. Besides, the HIF-1? C1772T polymorphism most likely contributes to susceptibility to malignant tumors, especially in American population.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576222","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.818239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.741545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.575724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.420072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.36082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.339216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.278641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.217446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Sensitivity analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis"},{"name":"Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal of New South Wales","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer,_Trader_and_Tenancy_Tribunal_of_New_South_Wales"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"1772","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1772"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Hypoxia-inducible factors","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors"}]}
