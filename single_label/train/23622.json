{"id":23622,"title":"Molecular characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients with hospital readmissions.","abstract":"It is unclear whether patients colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) continue to harbor the same genotype during hospital readmissions. We characterized 140 MRSA strains isolated from 33 persistent MRSA carriers with hospital readmissions. Nearly half of the patients continued to harbor the same genotype, and the rest acquired different genotypes. Among 25 patients who received eradication therapy, 16 (64%) were colonized with MRSA strains exhibiting different genotypes from the preexisting one.
