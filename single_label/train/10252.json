{"id":10252,"title":"[Molecular mechanisms regulating metastasis of cancer cells with special emphasis on rhabdomyosarcoma].","abstract":"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a malignant tumor of soft tissue derived from embryonic mesenchymal and/or neuroectodermal tissues. It is most often associated with other genetic syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni or Bechwith-Wiedeman. RMS cells show morphological similarities to striated muscle and the presence of specific markers of muscle tissue. At the histological level, it is divided into two subtypes (alveolar RMS - ARMS and embryonal RMS - ERMS), which differ in their genetic background, and prognosis. In recent years there has been significant progress in understanding the mechanisms that regulate RMS cell growth and metastasis. Recently, a number of several chemokines, cytokines or growth factors and their receptors were identified involved in RMS pathogenesis as well as animal models of this tumor have been developed. This knowledge is of great importance in the development of potential therapeutic strategies not only in RMS, but also other types of cancer. This paper will discuss the theories of the origin of this rare tumor and the molecular mechanisms involved in its growth and metastasis. The processes and mechanisms described herein, such as chemotaxis, adhesion, proliferation, intracellular signal transduction, seem to universal for number of cancer types.
