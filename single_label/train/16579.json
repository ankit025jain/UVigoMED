{"id":16579,"title":"Current and future trends in the diagnosis of periprosthetic hip infection.","abstract":"The challenge of confirming the diagnosis of prosthetic hip infection is two-fold. First, the presentation of the patient with a prosthetic hip infection often has limited or few subjective complaints and physical findings, nonconfirmatory inflammatory laboratory markers, and negative culture results. Second, there has not been consistent agreement of the definition of prosthetic join infection. Recent work by the Musculoskeletal Infection Society has created a new uniform definition for research and clinical use that may improve the ability to accurately diagnose prosthetic hip infections individually and share data among different sites for research collaboration.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975758","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.587247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.421461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.378001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.355673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.115028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Data sharing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sharing"}]}
