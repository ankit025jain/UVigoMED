{"id":87120,"title":"[The use of recombinant interleukin-2 in children with encephalitis].","abstract":"To study the efficacy of the domestic recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) in the complex treatment of encephalitis.Forty patients, aged from 6 months to 17 years, were treated with the drug. A comparison group involved 35 patients who did not receive the drug.Recombinant IL-2 reduced (p<0.05) the aggravation of symptoms to 5.4±1.3 days, neurological deficit (1.6±0.2 EDSS scores at discharge from the hospital), frequency of exacerbations (from 22.9 to 5%) and frequency of cases with the development of multiple sclerosis during 3 years (from 17.1 to 2.5%). Parameters of the drug efficacy were correlated with positive changes in immunological parameters after 3-4 days of treatment. The study of multimodal evoked potentials demonstrated the positive effect of the drug on the central afferent conduction times. The follow-up MRI examination showed the decrease in the frequency of focal changes.Recombinant IL-2 is recommended for treatment of children with encephalitis.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24988955","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Encephalitis","weight":0.694264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.554062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.399795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Evoked potential","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.213079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Aggravation (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggravation_(law)"},{"name":"Expanded Disability Status Scale","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_Disability_Status_Scale"},{"name":"Afferent","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afferent"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Social change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change"},{"name":"Functional neurological deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neurological_deficit"}]}
