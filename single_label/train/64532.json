{"id":64532,"title":"IgG4-related disease: a rheumatologist's perspective.","abstract":"Given that the clinical features of several IgG4-related diseases (IgG4-RD) can mimic those of autoimmune disorders, the aim of this study was to find possible distinguishing characteristics that would help us identify such cases from the pool of patients in a rheumatology clinic.From our clinic's medical records, we identified patients who fulfilled the recently published diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD. We recorded their presenting features, co-morbid conditions, laboratory, radiologic and histologic findings as well as their treatment and outcome.We identified 11 cases of IgG4-RD: 4 cases of IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), 5 cases of IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF)/ periaortitis, 2 cases of IgG4-related sialadenitis and one of IgG4-related interstitial nephritis. 5 out of the 11 patients had been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, namely rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). 3 out of 11 patients were subsequently diagnosed with neoplastic disorders. All patients with IgG4-related AIP had raised CRP levels at presentation. Presenting features of RPF/periaortitis patients were constitutional symptoms, abnormal renal function, hypertension and back pain. Patients with IgG4-related sialadenitis had clinical features mimicking SS. The majority of patients had a favourable response to steroids.We present common IgG4-RD presentations in the setting of a rheumatology clinic. Increased awareness may avoid delay in diagnosis.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25068679","annotations":[{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Rheumatology","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatology"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.824939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Antiphospholipid syndrome","weight":0.764248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiphospholipid_syndrome"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nephritis","weight":0.703373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephritis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.609206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.464585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.381049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Interstitial nephritis","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_nephritis"},{"name":"Dietitian","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"}]}
