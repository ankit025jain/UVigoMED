{"id":42467,"title":"Sonography of the pediatric gastrointestinal system.","abstract":"Sonography is a commonly used modality for the investigation of abdominal symptoms in the pediatric population. It is a highly sensitive, readily available imaging modality that does not require ionizing radiation, iodinated contrast material, or anesthesia and can be performed at the bedside if necessary. Abdominal ultrasound is therefore often the first examination performed. This article presents an overview of the ultrasound characteristics of some of the most frequently encountered pathologies as well as some more rarely encountered entities. Our aim was to present a series of characteristic images of a wide gamut of pediatric abdominal conditions. The goal was to familiarize the reader with key sonographic features of both congenital and acquired gastrointestinal pathologies in children, making them more easily recognizable.
