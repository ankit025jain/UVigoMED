{"id":84576,"title":"Annexin A1 mediates hydrogen sulfide properties in the control of inflammation.","abstract":"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous mediator synthesized in mammalian tissues by three main enzymes-cystathionine-?-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-?-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate-sulfurtransferase-and its levels increase under inflammatory conditions or sepsis. Since H2S and H2S-releasing molecules afford inhibitory properties in leukocyte trafficking, we tested whether endogenous annexin A1 (AnxA1), a glucocorticoid-regulated inhibitor of inflammation acting through formylated-peptide receptor 2 (ALX), could display intermediary functions in the anti-inflammatory profile of H2S. We first investigated whether endogenous AnxA1 could modulate H2S biosynthesis. To this end, a marked increase in CBS and/or CSE gene products was quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in aortas, kidneys, and spleens collected from AnxA1(-/-) mice, as compared with wild-type animals. When lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages were studied, H2S-donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) counteracted the increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA evoked by the endotoxin, yet it was inactive in macrophages harvested from AnxA1(-/-) mice. Next we studied the effect of in vivo administration of NaHS in a model of interleukin-1? (IL-1?)-induced mesenteric inflammation. AnxA1(+/+) mice treated with NaHS (100 ?mol/kg) displayed inhibition of IL-1?-induced leukocyte adhesion/emigration in the inflamed microcirculation, not observed in AnxA1(-/-) animals. These results were translated by testing human neutrophils, where NaHS (10-100 ?M) prompted an intense mobilization (>50%) of AnxA1 from cytosol to cell surface, an event associated with inhibition of cell/endothelium interaction under flow. Taken together, these data strongly indicate the existence of a positive interlink between AnxA1 and H2S pathway, with nonredundant functions in the control of experimental inflammation.
