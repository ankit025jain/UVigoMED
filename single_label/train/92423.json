{"id":92423,"title":"The revision acetabulum--allograft and bone substitutes: vestigial organs for bone deficiency.","abstract":"A common situation presenting to the orthopaedic surgeon today is a worn acetabular liner with substantial acetabular and pelvic osteolysis. The surgeon has many options for dealing with osteolytic defects. These include allograft, calcium based substitutes, demineralised bone matrix, or combinations of these options with or without addition of platelet rich plasma. To date there are no clinical studies to determine the efficacy of using bone-stimulating materials in osteolytic defects at the time of revision surgery and there are surprisingly few studies demonstrating the clinical efficacy of these treatment options. Even when radiographs appear to demonstrate incorporation of graft material CT studies have shown that incorporation is incomplete. The surgeon, in choosing a graft material for a surgical procedure must take into account the efficacy, safety, cost and convenience of that material.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381412","annotations":[{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Osteolysis","weight":0.765384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolysis"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.736981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.256502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Vestigiality","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestigiality"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.175367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.166125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Osteon","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteon"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
