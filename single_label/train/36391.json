{"id":36391,"title":"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: treatment and outcomes.","abstract":"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a congenital defect in the diaphragm that allows herniation of abdominal contents into the fetal chest and leads to varying degrees of pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. Advances in prenatal diagnosis and the institution of standardized delivery and postnatal care protocols have led to improved survival. Fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion shows early promise for patients with the most severe CDH, but prospective randomized data is still required. CDH survivors have a variety of associated morbidities that require long-term follow-up and early intervention strategies for optimal care.
