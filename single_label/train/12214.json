{"id":12214,"title":"A novel nano-carrier transdermal gel against inflammation.","abstract":"The objective was to develop a stable, reproducible and patient non-infringing novel transdermal drug delivery system \"nano-carrier transdermal gel\" (NCTG) in combination of partial dose replacement of diclofenac diethylamine (DDEA) by curcumin (CRM). The drug content of gel was 99.30 and 97.57% for DDEA and CRM. Plasma samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). Data were integrated with Analystâ„¢ and analyzed by WinNonlin; stability parameters were analyzed using Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. Its average skin irritation scored 0.49 concluded to be non-irritant, safe for human use and in vivo studies revealed significantly greater extent of absorption and highly significant inhibition (%) of carrageenan induced paw edema. The results also demonstrated that encapsulation of drugs in nano-carrier increases its biological activity due to superior skin penetration potential. Hence, a novel once day transdermal gel of nano-carrier (nano-transfersomes; deformable vesicular) is achieved, to increase systemic availability, subsequent reduction in dose and toxicity of DDEA was developed for the treatment of inflammation.
