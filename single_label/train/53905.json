{"id":53905,"title":"Innovative uses of electronic health records and social media for public health surveillance.","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) and social media have the potential to enrich public health surveillance of diabetes. Clinical and patient-facing data sources for diabetes surveillance are needed given its profound public health impact, opportunity for primary and secondary prevention, persistent disparities, and requirement for self-management. Initiatives to employ data from EHRs and social media for diabetes surveillance are in their infancy. With their transformative potential come practical limitations and ethical considerations. We explore applications of EHR and social media for diabetes surveillance, limitations to approaches, and steps for moving forward in this partnership between patients, health systems, and public health.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488369","annotations":[{"name":"Public health","weight":0.80736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.578758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.457165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.437023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.399516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.391104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.328168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.28735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Social media","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.130097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Health system","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Electronic health record","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Wiktionary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Clinical surveillance","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_surveillance"},{"name":"Disruptive technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology"}]}
