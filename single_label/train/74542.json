{"id":74542,"title":"Max-margin based learning for discriminative Bayesian network from neuroimaging data.","abstract":"Recently, neuroimaging data have been increasingly used to study the causal relationship among brain regions for the understanding and diagnosis of brain diseases. Recent work on sparse Gaussian Bayesian network (SGBN) has shown it as an efficient tool to learn large scale directional brain networks from neuroimaging data. In this paper, we propose a learning approach to constructing SGBNs that are both representative and discriminative for groups in comparison. A max-margin criterion built directly upon the SGBN models is proposed to effectively optimize the classification performance of the SGBNs. The proposed method shows significant improvements over the state-of-the-art works in the discriminative power of SGBNs.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320815","annotations":[{"name":"Learning","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Bayesian network","weight":0.542693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.483031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.435138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Bayesian probability","weight":0.429563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.411136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.169901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.153892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.115895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Sparse matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix"},{"name":"List of regions in the human brain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_in_the_human_brain"},{"name":"Statistical classification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification"},{"name":"Discriminative model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminative_model"},{"name":"Efficiency (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_(statistics)"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"}]}
