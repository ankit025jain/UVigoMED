{"id":89481,"title":"Upper lateral strut graft: a technique to improve the internal nasal valve.","abstract":"Internal nasal valve (INV) collapse can contribute significantly to nasal obstruction and may be caused by upper lateral cartilage (ULC) collapse medially or laterally. Surgical techniques addressing INV collapse have focused more on treating the narrowed INV angle, with less consideration of the lateral INV area. This article describes a technique to improve INV patency both medially and laterally. This study analyzes the changes in minimal cross-sectional area (MCA) at the INV after graft placement and determines whether these changes are significantly different for normal versus narrow INVs.Noses of six fixed cadavers were dissected by open rhinoplasty to release the ULCs from the septum. Upper lateral strut grafts were placed through subperichondrial pockets along the ULC undersurfaces and out over the piriform apertures into subperiosteal pockets. Grafts were secured to the dorsal septum. Acoustic rhinometry and nasal endoscopy were used to classify INVs before graft placement as narrow or normal and to assess changes at the INV after graft placement.Mean pregraft MCA was 0.58 cm(2). Mean MCA percent increase after graft placement was 22%. By INV type, percent increases were 51% for narrow INVs and 1% for normal INVs. Mean increases in MCA after graft placement were statistically significant for the entire group and for narrow INVs, with increases of 0.10 cm(2) (p = 0.03) and 0.22 cm(2) (p = 0.004), respectively.The upper lateral strut graft improved patency of cadaveric INVs, with statistically significant increases in the MCA most notable when placed for narrow INVs.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717888","annotations":[{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.775647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Rhinoplasty","weight":0.521924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoplasty"},{"name":"Periosteum","weight":0.517784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.492413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.406676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.146946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Nasal congestion","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.122372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.120317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Lateral nasal cartilage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_nasal_cartilage"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Aperture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture"},{"name":"Nasal bone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bone"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Piriform cortex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piriform_cortex"},{"name":"Unlimited liability corporation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlimited_liability_corporation"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Rhinoscope","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoscope"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Strut","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strut"}]}
