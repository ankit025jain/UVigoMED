{"id":89369,"title":"[Two cases of pneumocephalus following noninvasive continuous positive airway ventilation after transsphenoidal neurosurgery].","abstract":"The early use of continuous positive airway pressure ventilation has been shown to be effective and is recommended for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The complications of continuous positive airway pressure ventilation are not well described. We report two cases of pneumocephalus following the use of continuous positive airway pressure ventilation after transsphenoidal surgery. One patient had an obstructive sleep apnea and the other suffered acute respiratory failure. In both cases, pneumocephalus caused major morbidity and required specific treatment and prolonged considerably hospital stay. Based on these observations we believe new precautions in the use of noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure ventilation should be recommended.
