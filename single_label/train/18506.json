{"id":18506,"title":"Necrotising fasciitis due to an infected sebaceous cyst.","abstract":"The current case presents a patient who was admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of cellulitis of the right groin. In the following days, the patient's condition deteriorated and developed a septic shock. Exploration in the operating room showed a necrotising fasciitis of the adductor muscles, with an infected sebaceous cyst in the inguinal crest as port d'entr√©e. After extensive surgical debridement, antibiotic therapy, haemodynamic and respiratory support, the patient recovered. Necrotising fasciitis is a rare but very lethal condition, which necessitates aggressive surgical therapy and antibiotic support. The current case report is the first report to show a necrotising fasciitis due to an infected sebaceous cyst.
