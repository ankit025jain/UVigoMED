{"id":83074,"title":"Combined immediate loading of zygomatic and mandibular implants: a preliminary 2-year report of 19 patients.","abstract":"A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of simultaneous use of immediately loaded zygomatic and mandibular implants for full maxillomandibular restoration.A total of 40 zygomatic and 112 conventional implants were placed in 19 edentulous and partially edentulous patients and restored with full-arch acrylic resin prostheses within 3 hours of surgery. Implant insertion torque values were between 35 and 45 Ncm.During the 1-year follow-up period, none of the 19 patients experienced implant or prosthesis failures. The patients did not experience any sinus infections or any other surgical complications from the performed procedures.Zygomatic and conventional implants can be simultaneously placed in the maxilla and mandible and successfully loaded with an acrylic resin prosthesis using the All-on-Four concept.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451884","annotations":[{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.686433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.674499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.645528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.416493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Acrylic resin","weight":0.359824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylic_resin"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.164972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Torque","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Zygomatic bone","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygomatic_bone"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
