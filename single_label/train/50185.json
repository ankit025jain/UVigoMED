{"id":50185,"title":"'Exercise snacks' before meals: a novel strategy to improve glycaemic control in individuals with insulin resistance.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate whether small doses of intense exercise before each main meal ('exercise snacks') would result in better blood glucose control than a single bout of prolonged, continuous, moderate-intensity exercise in individuals with insulin resistance.Nine individuals completed three exercise interventions in randomised order. Measures were recorded across 3 days with exercise performed on the middle day, as either: (1) traditional continuous exercise (CONT), comprising 30 min moderate-intensity (60% of maximal heart rate [HRmax]) incline walking before dinner; (2) exercise snacking (ES), consisting of 6?×?1 min intense (90% HRmax) incline walking intervals 30 min before each meal; or (3) composite exercise snacking (CES), encompassing 6?×?1 min intervals alternating between walking and resistance-based exercise, 30 min before meals. Meal timing and composition were controlled within participants for exercise interventions.ES attenuated mean 3 h postprandial glucose concentration following breakfast (by 1.4?±?1.5 mmol/l, p?=?0.02) but not lunch (0.4?±?1.0 mmol/l, p?=?0.22), and was more effective than CONT following dinner (0.7?±?1.5 mmol/l below CONT; p?=?0.04). ES also reduced 24 h mean glucose concentration by 0.7?±?0.6 mmol/l (p?=?0.01) and this reduction persisted for the subsequent 24 h (lower by 0.6?±?0.4 mmol/l vs CONT, relative to their baselines; p?=?0.01). CES was just as effective as ES (p?>?0.05 for all glycaemic variables) at improving glycaemic control.Dosing exercise as brief, intense 'exercise snacks' before main meals is a time-efficient and effective approach to improve glycaemic control in individuals with insulin resistance.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24817675","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.881596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Meal","weight":0.722715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.375382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.328887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Snack food","weight":0.319913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snack_food"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.316587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.228042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0979537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Lunch","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Consumer Electronics Show","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Breakfast","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast"},{"name":"Dosing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosing"},{"name":"Dinner","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinner"}]}
