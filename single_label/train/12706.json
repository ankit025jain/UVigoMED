{"id":12706,"title":"Utility and applications of orthotopic models of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for the evaluation of novel and emerging cancer therapeutics.","abstract":"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Despite advances in chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, lung cancer continues to have a low 5-year survival rate, highlighting a dire need for more effective means of prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Mouse models that recapitulate the clinical features of advanced human lung cancer are critical for testing novel therapeutic approaches. This unit describes a highly reproducible, easy-to-establish orthotopic murine model of lung cancer, provides methods for in vivo imaging and monitoring of tumor growth, and discusses the usefulness of this model for translational lung cancer research and the development of therapeutic strategies.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510718","annotations":[{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cancer research","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.513143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.44967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.394998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.393596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Human lung","weight":0.384709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_lung"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.1159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.0531412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Utilitarianism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"}]}
