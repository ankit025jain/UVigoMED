{"id":19431,"title":"[Significant factors for surgical site infection: analysis of 203 head and neck surgeries].","abstract":"Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication in head and neck surgeries. The aim of this study was to assess the rate of, and risk factors for SSI following surgical procedures of the head and neck. The study population comprised 206 patients who underwent surgery of head and neck region in NTT West Osaka Hospital between 2009 and 2011. The incidence rate and risk factors were estimated by the chi-square test and a logistic regression analysis. SSI occurred in 22 cases (10.8%) of 203 patients. A broad range of putative risk factors was recorded in each patient and statistically analyzed to elucidate SSI related factors. Univariate analysis indicated that low BMI, diabetes mellitus, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, surgical wound classification, duration of operation, blood loss, left implants and preoperative radiotherapy were risk factors associated with SSI. Multivariate statistics revealed four independent risk factors: surgical wound classification (odds ratio (OR) 5.88, p = 0.02), hypoalbuminemia (OR 11.48, p < 0.01), duration of operation (OR 18.66, p < 0.01) and left implants (OR 20.24, p < 0.01). Thus, to achieve a reduction in SSI, we need to take care of not only the factors related with surgical technique such as the duration of the operation or left implants, but the preoperative nutrition status.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
