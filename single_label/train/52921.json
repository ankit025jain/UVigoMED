{"id":52921,"title":"The NOTCH pathway in ?-cell growth and differentiation.","abstract":"Beta-cell replacement represents the optimal therapy for type 1 diabetes. Efforts to manipulate ?-cell proliferation and differentiation could be advanced by a better understanding of the normal pathways regulating ?-cell development and renewal. NOTCH signaling is a highly conserved pathway which plays a central role in pancreas development. Cell-lineage tracing has revealed the reactivation of the NOTCH pathway in adult human ? cells cultured under conditions which induce cell proliferation and dedifferentiation. Inhibition of NOTCH signaling in dedifferentiated cells following ex vivo expansion has been shown to promote restoration of the ?-cell phenotype. This approach may increase the availability of functional ? cells for transplantation.
