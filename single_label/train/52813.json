{"id":52813,"title":"Follicular thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the internal jugular vein demonstrated by 131I SPECT/CT.","abstract":"Cervical uptake detected by 131I whole body scintigraphy (131I-WBS) may be due to thyroid remnants or loco-regional metastases. We describe a patient with follicular carcinoma submitted to total thyroidectomy. 131I-WBS showed left cervical linear uptake and focal areas of uptake in the abdomen and pelvis. SPECT/CT images demonstrated a potential thrombus in the left jugular vein (confirmed by doppler neck ultrasound and MRI) as well as bone metastases. The patient was submitted to thrombectomy and histopathology confirmed metastasis of follicular carcinoma.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24566419","annotations":[{"name":"Follicular thyroid cancer","weight":0.933031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Internal jugular vein","weight":0.891218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_jugular_vein"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Scintigraphy","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintigraphy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.705032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.579191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Bone metastasis","weight":0.364669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_metastasis"},{"name":"Embolectomy","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolectomy"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"}]}
