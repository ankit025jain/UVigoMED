{"id":22508,"title":"Neurosurgical wound infection at a university hospital in Egypt; prospective study of 1,181 patients for 2 years.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to report the incidence rate of neurosurgical wound infection at our university as well as the predisposing risk factors.A 2-year hospital prospective study was conducted and included 1110 patients underwent 1181 elective neurosurgical procedures, 50.3% were male. The ages ranged between 4 days and 80 year with mean age of 33.9 ± 19.679. Instrumental spinal devices were applied in 189 (16%) of patients, and 114 (9.7%) underwent shunt surgery, while aneurysmal clips were used in 5 patients only. The mean duration of follow up was 17.46 ± 3.49 months.41 patients suffered surgical wound infection representing 3.47 % of the patients. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest organism in 10 (24.39%) patients followed by the E.coli in 5 (12.19%) patients, while the culture revealed no growth in 14 (34.14%) patients. 25 patients have one or more risk factors of wound infection. 28 cases were treated surgically and 13 patients received conservative treatment. 34 wound infections occurred early during hospitalization, while 7 patients had late wound infection. We have two death-related infection from meningitis and sever septicemia.The neurosurgical wound infection rate is usually low even in developing countries and remains within the accepted rate.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24535784","annotations":[{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Egypt","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.782668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.54469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.529262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.510689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"University","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.247895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
