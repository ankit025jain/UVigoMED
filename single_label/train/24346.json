{"id":24346,"title":"Understanding nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","abstract":"Bacteria are frequently implicated in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but their influence on airway inflammation remains unclear. This review will focus on nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), its impact on host immune responses, and the potential for vaccination strategies in COPD.NTHi is associated with impaired immune function in patients with COPD. Features of the bacterium itself potentiate its ability to colonize the lower airways. An imbalance between bacterial load and host immunity may lend itself to the development of exacerbations. Oral immunotherapy may be a method of augmenting the host immune response and could provide protection from exacerbations.A causal link between NTHi and COPD exacerbations has not been clearly established. However, colonization of the lower airways by NTHi likely plays a significant role in the inflammatory state of COPD.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24441573","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Haemophilus influenzae","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.754141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.734757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.606934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.426962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Haemophilus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus"},{"name":"Recurrent airway obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_airway_obstruction"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_exacerbation_of_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0130192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0127581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"}]}
