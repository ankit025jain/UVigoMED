{"id":46263,"title":"Tumor associated proteases -- prognostic markers of colorectal cancer.","abstract":"Associations between matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, 7, 9, tissue MMP inhibitor TIMP- I and plasminogen activation system components (uPA, tPA and PAl-1) plasma and/or tumor levels in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients were evaluated in order to reveal their potential clinical implications. Two groups of CRC patients monitored for 5 or 10 years were enclosed in the study. Earlier, corresponding markers 'levels were measured in their plasma and/or tumors by immunoenzymatic techniques. High tumor PAl-I (> or =1 4,0 ng/mg protein) was demonstrated to be a significant, but not independent unfavorable prognostic factor for 5 and I10 years overall survival. Its role was mostly pronounced in stage II1 patients. High preoperative plasma MMP-7 and TIMP-I levels (cut-offs - 4,0 and 347 ng/ml respectively) were shown to be independent unfavorable prognostic factors, and univariate analysis revealed unfavorable prognostic value of high tumor MMP-7 content (> or =7,8 ng/mg protein) in patients with disseminated process.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640092","annotations":[{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.858148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Tissue plasminogen activator","weight":0.790268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.69774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.669789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.599349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Urokinase","weight":0.577725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urokinase"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.539345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.473684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.458909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"MMP7","weight":0.032269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP7"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"}]}
