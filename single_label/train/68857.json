{"id":68857,"title":"A pilot clinical trial of intravesical mitomycin-C and external deep pelvic hyperthermia for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.","abstract":"This paper aims to evaluate the safety and heating efficiency of external deep pelvic hyperthermia combined with intravesical mitomycin C (MMC) as a novel therapy for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).We enrolled subjects with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) refractory NMIBC to an early phase clinical trial of external deep pelvic hyperthermia (using a BSD-2000 device) combined with MMC. Bladders were heated to 42?°C for 1?h during intravesical MMC treatment. Treatments were given weekly for 6 weeks, then monthly for 4 months. Heating parameters, treatment toxicity, and clinical outcomes were systematically measured.Fifteen patients were enrolled on the clinical trial. Median age was 66 years and 87% were male. Median European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) recurrence and progression scores were 6 and 8, respectively. The full treatment course was attained in 73% of subjects. Effective bladder heating was possible in all but one patient who could not tolerate the supine position due to lung disease. Adverse events were all minor (grade 2 or less) and no systemic toxicity was observed. The most common adverse effects were Foley catheter pain (40%), abdominal discomfort (33%), chemical cystitis symptoms (27%), and abdominal skin swelling (27%). With a median follow-up of 3.18 years, 67% experienced another bladder cancer recurrence (none were muscle invasive) and 13% experienced an upper tract recurrence.External deep pelvic hyperthermia using the BSD-2000 device is a safe and reproducible method of heating the bladder in patients undergoing intravesical MMC. The efficacy of this treatment modality should be explored further in clinical trials.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490762","annotations":[{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.801736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.730161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mitomycin","weight":0.592152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitomycin"},{"name":"Cystitis","weight":0.5904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystitis"},{"name":"Supine position","weight":0.566864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.489231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.488645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.457677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"EORTC","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EORTC"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"Foley catheter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_catheter"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0120813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"}]}
