{"id":67666,"title":"Measurement errors in polymerase chain reaction are a confounding factor for a correct interpretation of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism effects on lifelong premature ejaculation: a critical analysis of a previously published meta-analysis of six studies.","abstract":"To analyze a recently published meta-analysis of six studies on 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and lifelong premature ejaculation (PE).Calculation of fraction observed and expected genotype frequencies and Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) of cases and controls. LL,SL and SS genotype frequencies of patients were subtracted from genotype frequencies of an ideal population (LL25%, SL50%, SS25%, p?=?1 for HWE). Analysis of PCRs of six studies and re-analysis of the analysis and Odds ratios (ORs) reported in the recently published meta-analysis.Three studies deviated from HWE in patients and one study deviated from HWE in controls. In three studies in-HWE the mean deviation of genotype frequencies from a theoretical population not-deviating from HWE was small: LL(1.7%), SL(-2.3%), SS(0.6%). In three studies not-in-HWE the mean deviation of genotype frequencies was high: LL(-3.3%), SL(-18.5%) and SS(21.8%) with very low percentage SL genotype concurrent with very high percentage SS genotype. The most serious PCR deviations were reported in the three not-in-HWE studies. The three in-HWE studies had normal OR. In contrast, the three not-in-HWE studies had a low OR.In three studies not-in-HWE and with very low OR, inadequate PCR analysis and/or inadequate interpretation of its gel electrophoresis resulted in very low SL and a resulting shift to very high SS genotype frequency outcome. Consequently, PCRs of these three studies are not reliable. Failure to note the inadequacy of PCR tests makes such PCRs a confounding factor in clinical interpretation of genetic studies. Currently, a meta-analysis can only be performed on three studies-in-HWE. However, based on the three studies-in-HWE with OR of about 1 there is not any indication that in men with lifelong PE the frequency of LL,SL and SS genotype deviates from the general male population and/or that the SL or SS genotype is in any way associated with lifelong PE.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595335","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.819792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.671736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Ejaculation","weight":0.632436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculation"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.629532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.57086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.566722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.40255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.305179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Premature ejaculation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ejaculation"},{"name":"Absolute deviation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_deviation"},{"name":"Genotype frequency","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype_frequency"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Chemical equilibrium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium"},{"name":"Critical theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Schutzstaffel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"G.
