{"id":6645,"title":"Roles of ASIC3, TRPV1, and NaV1.8 in the transition from acute to chronic pain in a mouse model of fibromyalgia.","abstract":"Tissue acidosis is effective in causing chronic muscle pain. However, how muscle nociceptors contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain is largely unknown.Here we showed that a single intramuscular acid injection induced a priming effect on muscle nociceptors of mice. The primed muscle nociceptors were plastic and permitted the development of long-lasting chronic hyperalgesia induced by a second acid insult. The plastic changes of muscle nociceptors were modality-specific and required the activation of acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) or transient receptor potential cation channel V1 (TRPV1). Activation of ASIC3 was associated with increased activity of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channels but not protein kinase C? (PKC?) in isolectin B4 (IB4)-negative muscle nociceptors. In contrast, increased activity of TTX-resistant voltage-gated sodium channels with ASIC3 or TRPV1 activation in NaV1.8-positive muscle nociceptors was required for the development of chronic hyperalgesia. Accordingly, compared to wild type mice, NaV1.8-null mice showed briefer acid-induced hyperalgesia (5 days vs. >27 days).ASIC3 activation may manifest a new type of nociceptor priming in IB4-negative muscle nociceptors. The activation of ASIC3 and TRPV1 as well as enhanced NaV1.8 activity are essential for the development of long-lasting hyperalgesia in acid-induced, chronic, widespread muscle pain.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24957987","annotations":[{"name":"Fibromyalgia","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia"},{"name":"Tetrodotoxin","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrodotoxin"},{"name":"Hyperalgesia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia"},{"name":"Protein kinase C","weight":0.90816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C"},{"name":"Nociceptor","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociceptor"},{"name":"TRPV","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV"},{"name":"TRPV1","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.848098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cation","weight":0.814471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation"},{"name":"Transient receptor potential channel","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_receptor_potential_channel"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Sodium channel","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_channel"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.637238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.629353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.496338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Acidosis","weight":0.369202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis"},{"name":"Myalgia","weight":0.304946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myalgia"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.209809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.184002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Receptor potential","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_potential"},{"name":"Visual cortex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
