{"id":81653,"title":"Effect of simulated intraoral erosion and/or abrasion effects on etch-and-rinse bonding to enamel.","abstract":"To assess the influence of simulated oral erosive/abrasive challenges on the bond strength of an etch-and-rinse two-step bonding system to enamel using an in situ/ex vivo protocol.Bovine enamel blocks were prepared and randomly assigned to four groups: CONT - control (no challenge), ABR - 3x/day-1 minute toothbrushing; ERO - 3x/day - 5 minutes extraoral immersion into regular Coca Cola; and ERO+ABR - erosive protocol followed by a 1-minute toothbrushing. Eight blocks were placed into an acrylic palatal appliance for each volunteer (n = 13), who wore the appliance for 5 days. Two blocks were subjected to each of the four challenges. Subsequently, all the blocks were washed with tap water and Adper Single Bond 2/Filtek Z350 were placed. After 24 hours, 1 mm2 beams were obtained from each block to be tested with the microtensile bond strength test (50 N load at 0.5 mm/minute). The data were statistically analyzed by one-way RM-ANOVA and Tukey's tests (alpha = 0.05).No difference was detected among the ABR, ERO, and CONT groups (P > 0.05). ERO+ABR group yielded lower bond strengths than either the ABR and ERO groups (P < 0.0113).","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902402","annotations":[{"name":"Water","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Coca-Cola","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.426811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.360136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Tap water","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_water"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Poly(methyl methacrylate)","weight":0.0964716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Atomic number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"},{"name":"Baptism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"350","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350"},{"name":"Coca","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Tap (valve)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_(valve)"},{"name":"Beam (structure)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(structure)"},{"name":"New Zealand Education Review Office","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Education_Review_Office"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Tooth brushing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_brushing"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Abrasion (mechanical)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasion_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Home appliance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_appliance"},{"name":"Codex Borgianus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Borgianus"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Bond strength","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_strength"}]}
