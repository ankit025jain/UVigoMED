{"id":27224,"title":"The current and future landscape of urinary thromboxane testing to evaluate atherothrombotic risk.","abstract":"Biomarker testing for efficacy of therapy is an accepted way for clinicians to individualize dosing to genetic and/or environmental factors that may be influencing a treatment regimen. Aspirin is used by nearly 43 million Americans on a regular basis to reduce risks associated with various atherothrombotic diseases. Despite its widespread use, many clinicians are unaware of the link between suboptimal response to aspirin therapy and increased risk for inferior clinical outcomes in several disease states, and biomarker testing for efficacy of aspirin therapy is not performed as routinely as efficacy testing in other therapeutic areas. This article reviews the clinical and laboratory aspects of determining whole-body thromboxane production, particularly as it pertains to efficacy assessment of aspirin responsiveness.
