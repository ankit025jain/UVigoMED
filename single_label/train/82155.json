{"id":82155,"title":"Clinical application of genetics to guide prevention and treatment of oral diseases.","abstract":"Dental care costs in the United States exceed $100 billion annually. Personalized medicine efforts in dentistry are driven by potentially compelling clinical utility and cost-effectiveness prospects in the major diseases of periodontitis, caries, and oral cancers. This review discusses progress and challenges identifying genetic markers and showing clinical utility in dentistry. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of chronic periodontitis (CP) identified no significant variants, but CDKN2BAS variants on chromosome 9 were significantly associated with aggressive periodontitis. Stratifying patients by interleukin (IL)-1 gene variants, smoking and diabetes differentiated CP prevention outcomes. Dental caries' GWAS identified significant signals in LYZL2, AJAp1, and KPNA4; and efforts are ongoing to identify genetic factors for multiple caries phenotypes. Trials of molecularly targeted therapies are in progress for oral, head, and neck squamous cell carcinomas (OHNSCC) and results have been promising but limited in their effectiveness. Current opportunities and challenges for molecular targeting for OHNSCC are discussed.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702466","annotations":[{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.881791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Personalized medicine","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.719283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.672063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.655288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.621736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.545798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.436161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.394258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.328706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.243561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Chronic periodontitis","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.148197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Genome-wide association study","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"1000000000 (number)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000_(number)"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Chromosome 9 (human)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_9_(human)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"}]}
