{"id":31303,"title":"[Effect of notoginseng radix on expression quantity of TGF-beta1/ Smads and CTGF mRNA in rats with alcoholic liver disease].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of Notoginseng Radix on hepatic expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in rats with alcoholic liver disease (ALD), in order to discuss its protective effect on alcoholic cirrhosis.Fifty SD male rats were divided into the normal control group, the model group, the high-dose and low-dose Notoginseng Radix groups (3.0, 12.0 g x kg(-1)) and the magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate group (24 mg x kg(-1)), with 10 rats in each group. Apart from the control group, other groups were administered with ethanol-cornoil-pyrazole for 14 weeks to establish the alcoholic liver disease model. During the establishment of the model, the high-dose and low-dose Notoginseng Radix groups were administered with 12 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) Notoginseng Radix for 14 weeks, once everyday. Efforts were made to detect liver function, pathology with Masson staining, and the expressions of TGF-beta1, Smad3, Smad7 and CTGF mRNA.Compared with the rats in model group, rats in Notoginseng Radix groups showed significant reduction in liver ALT, AST, collagen fiber deposition, and TGF-beta1, Smad3 and CTGF mRNA expressions in liver tissues, with the increase in the expression quantity of Smad7 mRNA. There were differences between the Notoginseng Radix groups. No significant difference was observed between the high-dose Notoginseng Radix group and the magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate group.Notoginseng Radix can affect TGF-beta1/Smads signaling pathway and reduce the expression of CTGF.","date":"2014-01-01","categories":"Chemically-Induced
