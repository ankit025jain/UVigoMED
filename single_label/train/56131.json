{"id":56131,"title":"Acute retinal necrosis associated with Epstein-Barr virus: immunohistopathologic confirmation.","abstract":"Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is an infectious retinitis primarily caused by the herpesviruses. Although the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated as a cause of ARN, to our knowledge, there has been no histopathologic documentation. We report the clinical history and histopathologic confirmation that EBV can cause ARN.Clinical course and histopathology of a patient diagnosed with ARN caused by infection with EBV confirmed by molecular pathology.Epstein-Barr virus is a recognized cause of intraocular inflammation and has been implicated as a possible cause of ARN. However, to our knowledge, tissue demonstration of EBV in a patient with ARN has not previously been reported. We identified the organism in the necrotic retina of a patient receiving immunosuppression because of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743882","annotations":[{"name":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.858244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.85672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.708277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.706287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.682081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.536833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.219691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Molecular pathology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_pathology"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
