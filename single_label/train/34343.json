{"id":34343,"title":"[Papillary fibroelastoma attached to the underside of the aortic valve; report of a case].","abstract":"We report a case of papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve. A 72-year-old man was referred to our hospital with cardiac tumor incidentally detected by transthoracic echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a mobile tumor on the ventricular side of the aortic valve. We performed semi-emergency surgery and resected the tumor with a blade to prevent embolism. Pathologic findings revealed papillary fibroelastoma. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 10 days arter surgery. Follow-up transthoracic echocardiography has not shown any evidence of local recurrence.
