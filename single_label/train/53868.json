{"id":53868,"title":"The effect of ginger consumption on glycemic status, lipid profile and some inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"To assess the effect of ginger consumption on glycemic status, lipid profile and some inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 70 type 2 diabetic patients were enrolled. They allocated randomly into ginger group and control group. They consumed 1600?mg ginger versus 1600?mg wheat flour placebo daily for 12 weeks. Serum sugar, lipids, CRP, PGE2 and TNF? were measured before and after intervention.Ginger reduced fasting plasma glucose, HbA1C, insulin, HOMA, triglyceride, total cholesterol, CRP and PGE? significantly compared with placebo group (p?<?0.05). There were no significant differences in HDL, LDL and TNF? between two groups (p?>?0.05).Ginger improved insulin sensitivity and some fractions of lipid profile, and reduced CRP and PGE? in type 2 diabetic patients. Therefore ginger can be considered as an effective treatment for prevention of diabetes complications.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490949","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.769984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Ginger","weight":0.682648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Wheat","weight":0.65048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"},{"name":"Flour","weight":0.625182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.597689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.543093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complications of diabetes mellitus","weight":0.481475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complications_of_diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.465872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.375548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.340536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.260579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.146135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E2","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E2"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Homeostatic model assessment","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostatic_model_assessment"}]}
