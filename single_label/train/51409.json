{"id":51409,"title":"Changes in lipoprotein kinetics associated with type 2 diabetes affect the distribution of lipopolysaccharides among lipoproteins.","abstract":"Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are inflammatory components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and, in plasma, are mostly associated with lipoproteins. This association is thought to promote their catabolism while reducing their proinflammatory effects.Our aim was to determine the impact of lipoprotein kinetics on plasma LPS distribution and how it may affect patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).We performed a kinetic study in 30 individuals (16 T2DM patients, 14 controls) and analyzed the impact of changes in lipoprotein kinetics on LPS distribution among lipoproteins.Plasma LPS levels in T2DM patients were not different from those in controls, but LPS distribution in the two groups was different. Patients with T2DM had higher LPS-very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL; 31% ± 7% vs 22% ± 11%, P = .002), LPS-high-density lipoprotein (HDL; 29% ± 9% vs 19% ± 10%, P = .015), free (nonlipoprotein bound) LPS (10% ± 4% vs 7% ± 4%, P = .043) and lower LPS-low-density lipoprotein (LDL; 30% ± 13% vs 52% ± 16%, P = .001). In multivariable analysis, VLDL-LPS was associated with HDL-LPS (P < .0001); LDL-LPS was associated with VLDL-LPS (P = .004), and VLDL apolipoprotein (apo) B100 catabolism (P = .002); HDL-LPS was associated with free LPS (P < .0001) and VLDL-LPS (P = .033); free LPS was associated with HDL-LPS (P < .0001). In a patient featuring a dramatic decrease in VLDL catabolism due to apoA-V mutation, LDL-LPS was severely decreased (0.044 EU/mL vs 0.788 EU/mL in controls). The difference between T2DM patients and controls for LDL-LPS fraction was no longer significant after controlling for VLDL apoB100 total fractional catabolic rate.Our data suggest that in humans, free LPS transfers first to HDL and then to VLDL, whereas the LPS-bound LDL fraction is mainly derived from VLDL catabolism; the latter may hence represent a LPS catabolic pathway. T2DM patients show lower LDL-LPS secondary to reduced VLDL catabolism, which may represent an impaired catabolic pathway.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24694333","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.816916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.812643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein","weight":0.806447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.762121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Very low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.624116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.582973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein B","weight":0.498761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_B"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.236206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Kinetic energy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"},{"name":"Biodiesel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiesel"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Enzyme kinetics","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_kinetics"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"788","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/788"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Transfer (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Aban","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aban"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
