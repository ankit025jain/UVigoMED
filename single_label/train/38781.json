{"id":38781,"title":"Leopard syndrome: a report of five cases from one family in two generations.","abstract":"This is the first reported family with Leopard syndrome (LS) from Bosnia and Herzegovina. We report five cases of LS from two generations of the same family. In the present series of patients from one family, all patients carry the same recurrent mutation Y279C in the PTPN11 gene, exhibiting different phenotypes and a variable expression of multiple lentigines. The diagnosis may be on clinical basis as the diagnostic clues of LS are: multiple lentigines and caf√®-au-lait-spots, short stature, distinctive face, congenital heart disease, conduction abnormalities, abnormal genitalia, and sensorineural deafness.the clinical diagnosis of LS should be molecularly confirmed in the patient.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401936","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"LEOPARD syndrome","weight":0.583969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEOPARD_syndrome"},{"name":"Leopard","weight":0.575998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.56255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"PTPN11","weight":0.534715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPN11"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.509722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Lentigo","weight":0.398738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentigo"},{"name":"Short stature","weight":0.314564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_stature"},{"name":"Expressivity","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressivity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
