{"id":19122,"title":"[Children with asplenia or hyposplenia: Preventing overwhelming post splenectomy infection].","abstract":"The spleen's ability to prevent overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) is mainly given by its capacity to filter and phagocyte bacterial elements from the blood, remove foreign elements from it, and the early production of opsonins. The anatomic absence of the spleen is usually secondary to a surgical resection, but it could also be congenital. Streptococcus pneumoniae has been identified as the main agent of OPSI in asplenic patients with an extremely high global mortality associated. This article is an exhaustive review of the current evidence and recommendations available for prevention of invasive infections in asplenic patients.
