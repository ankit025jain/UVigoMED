{"id":37307,"title":"Growth hormone response to standard provocative stimuli and combined tests in very young children with Prader-Willi syndrome.","abstract":"In Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) a reduced growth hormone (GH) response to several stimulators has been documented in many studies, but none have focused on very young children. We evaluated the pattern of GH secretion in very young PWS patients.Twenty-seven genetically confirmed PWS children (10 females, aged 0.4-5 years, mean: 2.2 Â± 1.4 years) were included. All subjects underwent standard provocative tests (clonidine, CLO; and arginine, ARG) and one combined test [growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) plus pyridostigmine (13 patients) or GHRH plus arginine (14 patients)]. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels were also measured.While standard tests (CLO and ARG) showed low GH peak in 85.2 and 70.4% of the patients, respectively, the combined test was found to be normal in 85.2%. IGF-1 was low in 66.7% of patients. Out of 27 patients, 3 (11%) showed a normal GH peak with both standard tests (group A), 6 (22%) to one of the standard tests (group B) and 18 (67%) presented a low response to both standard tests (group C). Four subjects showed low response to both the combined and standard tests and reduced IGF-1.Our data suggest that very young PWS children seem to have impaired hypothalamic GHRH secretion with a normal GH pituitary reserve.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503962","annotations":[{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.578215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1","weight":0.578215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Hypothalamus","weight":0.506051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Clonidine","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonidine"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.28735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.0747244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Growth hormone releasing hormone","weight":0.0315646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone_releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Pyridostigmine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyridostigmine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Argentina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina"},{"name":"PWS (aircraft manufacturer)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWS_(aircraft_manufacturer)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
