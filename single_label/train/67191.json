{"id":67191,"title":"[The medical technology for the application of ultrasound therapy at the out-of-patient, in-patient, and spa-and-resort stages of medical rehabilitation of the patients presenting with pathospermia. The manual for physicians and researchers].","abstract":"The present manual is intended for the graduate medical specialists who completed a training course in urology, and urology, and physiotherapy based at the state-funded educational institutions and have the relevant certificates. Also, the manual is designed for the specialists engaged in scientific research on urology, restorative medicine, medical rehabilitation, and physiotherapy. The manual expounds indications and contraindications for ultrasound therapy of the patients presenting with pathospermia. Such treatment of genital glands was shown to be effective in 96.8% of the patients with pathospermia. Moreover, its advantages over alternative therapeutic modalities were demonstrated. The criteria for its choice (for differential application and prognosis of effectiveness) include the excretory form of grade I, II, and III pathospermia, the secretory form of grade I, II, and III pathospermia, the combined form of pathospermia, the presence or absence of moderate anatomical and functional changes in the testicles, the presence or absence of partial obstruction of the vas deferens.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640659","annotations":[{"name":"Urology","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.681782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Medical technology","weight":0.626571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_technology"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.583977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.572247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Vas deferens","weight":0.485456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vas_deferens"},{"name":"Graduate school","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_school"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.288387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.184596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.111487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Professional certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_certification"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Modal logic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Types of educational institutions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_educational_institutions"},{"name":"Liberalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"}]}
