{"id":21313,"title":"Stress and chytridiomycosis: exogenous exposure to corticosterone does not alter amphibian susceptibility to a fungal pathogen.","abstract":"Recent emergence and spread of the amphibian fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been attributed to a number of factors, including environmental stressors that increase host susceptibility to Bd. Physiological stress can increase circulating levels of the hormone, corticosterone, which can alter a host's physiology and affect its susceptibility to pathogens. We experimentally elevated whole-body levels of corticosterone in both larval and post-metamorphic amphibians, and subsequently tested their susceptibility to Bd. Larvae of three species were tested (Anaxyrus boreas, Rana cascadae, and Lithobates catesbeianus) and one species was tested after metamorphosis (R. cascadae). After exposure to Bd, we measured whole-body corticosterone, infection, mortality, growth, and development. We found that exposure to exogenous corticosterone had no effect on Bd infection in any species or at either life stage. Species varied in whole-body corticosterone levels and exposure to corticosterone reduced mass in A. boreas and R. cascadae larvae. Exposure to Bd did not affect mortality, but had a number of sublethal effects. Across species, larvae exposed to Bd had higher corticosterone levels than unexposed larvae, but the opposite pattern was found in post-metamorphic R. cascadae. Bd exposure also increased larval length in all species and increased mass in R. cascadae larvae. Our results indicate that caution is warranted in assuming a strong link between elevated levels of corticosterone and disease susceptibility in amphibians. The role of physiological stress in altering Bd prevalence in amphibian populations is likely much more complicated than can be explained by examining a single \"stress\" endpoint.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610865","annotations":[{"name":"Amphibian","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian"},{"name":"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis","weight":0.88511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batrachochytrium_dendrobatidis"},{"name":"Chytridiomycosis","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chytridiomycosis"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.827199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.768492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Metamorphosis","weight":0.759401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.673635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.347438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.277041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Pathogenic fungi","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_fungi"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Corticosterone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosterone"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Rana (genus)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rana_(genus)"}]}
