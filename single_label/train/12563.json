{"id":12563,"title":"Codon usage bias of the phosphoprotein gene of spring viraemia of carp virus and high codon adaptation to the host.","abstract":"In this study, we calculated the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) value and the effective number of codons (ENC) value to carry out principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis of the codon usage pattern of the phosphoprotein gene (P gene) of spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV). The synonymous codon usage pattern in P genes is geography-specific, based on PCA analysis. The high correlation between (G + C)1,2 % and (G + C)3 % suggests that mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main factor that determines the codon usage and base components in P genes. At least 40 out of 59 synonymous codons are similarly selected in all functional genes within five complete SVCV genomes, and the hosts based on the RSCU data. These results not only provide insight into variations in the codon usage pattern of SVCV but also may help in understanding the processes governing the evolution of SVCV.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519460","annotations":[{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.742918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.551766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Principal component analysis","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.420745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Synonym","weight":0.402908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym"},{"name":"Codon usage bias","weight":0.340191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codon_usage_bias"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.100392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Carp","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carp"},{"name":"Phosphoprotein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoprotein"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Spring (hydrosphere)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrosphere)"},{"name":"Canonical correlation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_correlation"},{"name":"Electronic toll collection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_toll_collection"},{"name":"C3 carbon fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_carbon_fixation"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"}]}
