{"id":62416,"title":"Importance of meaning-making for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","abstract":"The purpose of this integrative literature review of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for hematologic malignancies was to determine whether meaning-making might be helpful to improve coping and psychological adaptation as patients navigate HSCT.CINAHL®, MEDLINE®, and PsychINFO databases, and ancestry searches. Search terms included bone marrow transplant, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, hematologic malignancy, quality of life, lived experience, psychosocial, psychological, isolation, and social support.Twenty-four research articles published from 1989-2012 were included. Five major themes emerged: (a) lived experience, (b) coping style, (c) quality of life, (d) psychological morbidity, and (e) potential for post-traumatic growth. Meaning-making was a thread that ran through each of the key areas of the HSCT experience.Physical, psychosocial, and spiritual issues arise during HSCT that are unique among patients diagnosed with cancer. Meaning-making is key to adaptive coping and helps to reduce physical, psychosocial, and spiritual challenges, as well as assists patients in experiencing positive personal growth. Interventions focused on meaning-making should be tested in this population.Nurses are positioned to develop and deliver meaning-making interventions for patients undergoing HSCT and to assess patient-oriented outcomes.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24578083","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.808084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.805725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.778848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.756014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.752514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.717027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.686433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.64796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.645108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.387322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.351098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.334999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.327673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.177137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.106018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Spirituality","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Self-help","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-help"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Word stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
