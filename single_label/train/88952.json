{"id":88952,"title":"Expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors after hippocampal injury.","abstract":"The expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2, mGluR3, mGluR4, and mGluR5) and dendritic cytoplasmic BC1 RNA in the hippocampus and frontal neocortex of Wistar rats was studied 1 and 4 weeks after intrahippocampal microinjection of kainic acid. The efficiency of glutamatergic transmission was shown to change not only in the injured hippocampus, but also in the neocortex. It was associated with variations in the expression of presynaptic (mGluR2, mGluR3, and mGluR4) and postsynaptic receptors (mGluR5).","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771426","annotations":[{"name":"Kainic acid","weight":0.921372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kainic_acid"},{"name":"Neocortex","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex"},{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Metabotropic receptor","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabotropic_receptor"},{"name":"Chemical synapse","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synapse"},{"name":"Glutamate receptor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_receptor"},{"name":"Metabotropic glutamate receptor","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabotropic_glutamate_receptor"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.651122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.473482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 3","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabotropic_glutamate_receptor_3"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabotropic_glutamate_receptor_5"},{"name":"Microinjection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microinjection"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabotropic_glutamate_receptor_4"},{"name":"Wistar rat","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wistar_rat"},{"name":"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 2","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabotropic_glutamate_receptor_2"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"}]}
