{"id":92770,"title":"Treatment of cancer in a child with ocular xeroderma pigmentosa (XP) in Malawi.","abstract":"A 3-year-old girl presented to the Eye Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, with multiple ulcerating lesions on her face and in her eyes. Her skin was freckled, with hypopigmented and hyperpigmented areas (poikilodermia) typical of xeroderma pigmentosa. The tumors on the conjunctiva of the right eye and the lower eyelid of the left eye appeared to be squamous cell carcinomas. Chemotherapy with intravenous 5-flourouracil (1000 mg/m) for 5 days and cisplatin (50 mg/m) for 2 days for 3 cycles every 3 weeks was well tolerated. Good response occurred after 1 cycle and after 2 more courses the tumors had resolved.
