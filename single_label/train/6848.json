{"id":6848,"title":"Autoimmunity: regulatory B cells--IL-35 and IL-21 regulate the regulators.","abstract":"IL-21 regulates the activity and number of IL-10-producing regulatory B cells (B10 cells) that modulate immune responses and limit diverse autoimmune diseases. A new study demonstrates that IL-35 has a similar function. Identifying regulatory circuits that control B10-cell function in vivo might open the door to future treatments for autoimmune diseases.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934192","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.822951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.801314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.504453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.460792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.339806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.302091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Interleukin 21","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_21"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Door","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Nuclear Regulatory Commission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission"},{"name":"B-10 recoilless rifle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-10_recoilless_rifle"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
