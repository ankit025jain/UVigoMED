{"id":80215,"title":"[Characterization of human hydatidosis mortality: Chile, 2000-2010].","abstract":"Hydatidosis as a worldwide zoonosis with a high socio-economic impact in Chile and other countries for which it is a notifiable human disease in our country.To characterize death rates by hydatidosis and whether there are differences according to the region of residence.A descriptive analysis using Data System Deaths (2000-2010) was performed.The total number of deaths was 293 (56% male). The mortality rate changed from 0.16 in 2000 to 0.11 in 2010 per 100.000 inhabitants. The main diagnosis corresponded to B67.9 (Echinococcosis, other and unspecified). Most fatal cases had a basic level of education and the Araucanía Region had the highest mortality rate. There was a loss of life of 5022.04 years by the premature death of 293 people, with a ratio of 0.31 PYLL years lost per 1000 inhabitants. In the Araucanía Region this ratio increased to 1.03 PYLL years lost per 1000 inhabitants.The mortality rate tends to decrease, however this trend might mask regional differences. It should be noted that deaths caused by hydatidosis are preventable deaths and therefore unjust. Finally, the mortality analysis is important to better understand the burden of the disease and evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24740768","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.768149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.738704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.669436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.551267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Seventh Avenue Line (Brooklyn)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Avenue_Line_(Brooklyn)"},{"name":"Araucana","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araucana"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"293","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/293"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Analytic philosophy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy"},{"name":"Mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask"},{"name":"Japanese dialects","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_dialects"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"The Gamble (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamble_(The_O.C.)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
