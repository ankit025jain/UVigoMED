{"id":85109,"title":"[Pulmonary hypertension: a review of current clinical practice].","abstract":"This short review illustrates current epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension. In the first part, classification, definition and prevalence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) are explained. According to recent reports, overall PH prevalence was 0.3% to 6.0% with left heart disease occupying the most proportion, followed by pulmonary disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) constituting far less proportion of 10 to 50 per 1 million people. In diagnosis, flow of diagnosis of PH, differential diagnosis of PH and how to determine the severity of PH are explained including recent development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and gene abnormality study on BMPRII. In treatment, newly-developed pulmonary vasodilators are shown as well as how to combine them in PAH, and in CTEPH treatment the drugs, operation and catheter therapy including our experience are demonstrated.
