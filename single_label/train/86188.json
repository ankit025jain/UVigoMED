{"id":86188,"title":"Identification of a nuclear protein, LRRC42, involved in lung carcinogenesis.","abstract":"On the basis of the gene expression profiles of 120 lung cancer cases using a cDNA microarray containing 27,648 genes or expressed sequence tags (ESTs), we identified LRRC42 (Leucine-rich repeat containing 42) to be significantly upregulated in the majority of lung cancers. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that LRRC42 was expressed only in testis among normal tissues examined. Knockdown of LRRC42 expression by siRNA against LRRC42 significantly suppressed the growth of lung cancer cells. On the other hand, stable induction of LRRC42 expression significantly promoted cell growth. LRRC42, which was found to localize in the nucleus of mammalian cells, is likely to interact with and stabilize GATAD2B (GATA zinc finger domain-containing 2B) and MBD3 (Methyl-CpG-binding domain proteinÂ 3) proteins that could contribute to lung cancer cell proliferation partly through the regulation of p21Waf1/Cip1. Our findings suggest that LRRC42 overexpression as well as its interaction with LRRC42-GATAD2B might play essential roles in lung carcinogenesis, and be a promising molecular target for lung cancer therapy.
