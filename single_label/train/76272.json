{"id":76272,"title":"Ten weeks of aerobic training does not result in persistent changes in VLDL triglyceride turnover or oxidation in healthy men.","abstract":"Very low density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDL-TG) and free fatty acids (FFA) constitute a substantial proportion of human energy supply both at rest and during exercise. Exercise acutely decreases VLDL-TG concentration, and VLDL-TG clearance is increased after an exercise bout. However, the effects of long-term training are not clear.The aim was to investigate long-term effects of training by direct assessments of VLDL-TG and palmitate kinetics and oxidation in healthy lean men (n=9) at rest, before and after a 10-week training program, compared with a non-training control group (n=9).VLDL-TG kinetics were assessed by a primed constant infusion of [1-14C]VLDL-TG, and VLDL-TG oxidation by specific activity (14CO2) in expired air. The metabolic study days were placed 60-72?h after the last exercise bout.Palmitate kinetics and oxidation were assessed by a 2?h constant infusion of [9,10-(3)H]palmitate. In the training group (n=9), maximal oxygen uptake increased significantly by ?20% (P<0.05), and the insulin sensitivity (assessed by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp) improved significantly (P<0.05). Despite these metabolic improvements, no changes were observed in VLDL-TG secretion, clearance, or oxidation or in palmitate kinetics.We conclude that 10 weeks of exercise training did not induce changes in VLDL-TG and palmitate kinetics in healthy lean men.","date":"2014-10-11","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25117466","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.741221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.671336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Palmitic acid","weight":0.612397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitic_acid"},{"name":"Aerobic exercise","weight":0.541068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Aerobic organism","weight":0.444451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.418034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Very low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.414372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"VO2 max","weight":0.301662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.228971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.129087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chemical kinetics","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_kinetics"}]}
