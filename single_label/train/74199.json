{"id":74199,"title":"Regional lymphatic recurrence after salvage surgery for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence of breast cancer without local treatment for regional lymphatic basin.","abstract":"There is limited information regarding rates of and risk factors for regional lymphatic recurrence (RLR) after salvage surgery for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) without local treatment for the regional lymphatic basin.One hundred two patients, who underwent salvage breast surgery without local treatment for the regional lymphatic basin (surgery or radiotherapy) for IBTR that relapsed after breast-conserving surgery for primary breast cancer, were reviewed retrospectively to examine the rate of and risk factors for RLR.Of the 102 patients, 9 patients (8.8%) had RLR with a median follow-up period of 3.7 years after salvage breast surgery for IBTR. The estrogen receptor (ER) status and lymphovascular invasion of the recurrent breast tumor were both independent predictive factors of RLR (P = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively).The rate of RLR was not low in patients with IBTR who received salvage breast surgery only without any treatment for the regional lymphatic basin. The ER status and lymphovascular invasion of the recurrent breast tumor were predictive factors of RLR.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863697","annotations":[{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.695352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.449947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0475422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahal_Letterman_Lanigan_Racing"},{"name":"ER (TV series)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Drainage basin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"Breast surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_surgery"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
