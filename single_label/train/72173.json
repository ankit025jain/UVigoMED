{"id":72173,"title":"Recurrences after intensity modulated radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma more likely to originate from regions with high baseline [18F]-FDG uptake.","abstract":"To analyze the recurrence pattern in relation to target volumes and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiation.520 patients received radiotherapy for HNSCC from 2005 to 2009. Among 100 patients achieving complete clinical response and a later recurrence, 39 patients with 48 loco-regional failures had a recurrence CT scan before any salvage therapy. The estimated point of origin of each recurrence was transferred to the planning CT by deformable image co-registration. The recurrence position was then related to the delineated target volumes and iso-SUV-contours relative to the maximum standard uptake value (SUV). We defined the recurrence density as the total number of recurrences in a sub-volume divided by the sum of that volume for all patients.54% (95% CI 37-69%) of recurrences originated inside the FDG-positive volume and 96% (95% CI 86-99%) in the high dose region. Recurrence density was significantly higher in the central target volumes (P<0.0001) and increased with increasing FDG avidity (P=0.036).The detailed pattern-of-failure data analysis suggests that most recurrences occur in the FDG PET positive areas or the solid tumor.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993331","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission
