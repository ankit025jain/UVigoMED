{"id":77586,"title":"Use of respiratory and facial protection.","abstract":"Infectious microorganisms can be transmitted by various routes. Respiratory and facial protection is needed to prevent infection with organisms that are usually transmitted through the droplet/airborne route, or when airborne particles have been artificially created, for example during aerosol-generating procedures. Recent experiences with severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic (H1N1) influenza in 2009 highlighted that health professionals may have difficulty in choosing the correct facial and respiratory protection. The Scientific Development Committee of the Healthcare Infection HealtSociety established a working group to develop guidance addressing this issue.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592631","annotations":[{"name":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Antiseptic","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiseptic"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.652992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.482717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.469872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Influenza A virus subtype H1N1","weight":0.116495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Airborne forces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_forces"},{"name":"Pacific Railroad Surveys","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Railroad_Surveys"},{"name":"Scientific Development Concept","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Development_Concept"},{"name":"Working group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_group"}]}
