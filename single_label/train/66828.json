{"id":66828,"title":"[Update for the management of kidney stones in 2013. Lithiasis Committee of the French Association of Urology].","abstract":"Since the publication of the latest recommendations of the Lithiasis Comity of the French Association of Urology (CLAFU) on the management of ureteral and renal stones, practices have evolved. This text provides an update for the treatment of kidney stones. It is especially the important advances in the field of laser-ureterorenoscopy that changed practices. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy has been enriched by technical modifications and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy confirmed its predominant place in the first line of treatment. For stones less than 20mm, extracorporeal lithotripsy remains the standard, but in some cases the possibility of recommending a flexible ureterorenoscopy is possible in first line. For stones more than 20mm, percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the standard treatment, but optional flexible ureteroscopy and extracorporeal lithotripsy are possible. The treatment carried out, collect the stone fragments for a morpho-constitutional analysis and achieve a metabolic evaluation is necessary, to investigate etiologic and give dietary advices to prevent recurrence.
