{"id":52006,"title":"[Small cell carcinoma of the ovary].","abstract":"Small cell carcinoma of the ovary of the hypercalcemic type is a rare tumor. We report a case in a 34-year-old patient, revealed by a pelvic pain. The imaging found a large mass of the right ovary. The patient had right oophorectomy and total hysterectomy, a left oophorectomy, pelvic and a para-aortic lymphadenectomy. She subsequently received 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy followed by pelvic radiation therapy. The hypercalcemic small cell carcinoma of the ovary is a rare disease of poor prognosis. Treatment approaches include surgery, chemotherapy with the addition of radiotherapy.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637019","annotations":[{"name":"Small-cell carcinoma","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Oophorectomy","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oophorectomy"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.850613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Hypercalcaemia","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercalcaemia"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.562366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Pelvic pain","weight":0.532936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_pain"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
