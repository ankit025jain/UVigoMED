{"id":29815,"title":"Barriers to substance abuse treatment in rural and urban communities: counselor perspectives.","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to compare rural and urban substance abuse counselors' perceptions of barriers to providing effective treatment services. Data were collected from 28 substance abuse counselors in Kentucky during four focus group sessions in 2008. Line-by-line coding and memoing were used by two raters on the transcribed data to isolate findings. The results of this study suggest that, though rural and urban counselors encounter similar constraints that hamper successful treatment outcomes, rural counselors are subject to special circumstances within their communities that present unique challenges to treatment efficacy. Novel contributions, implications, and limitations are also discussed.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611820","annotations":[{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.589614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.575564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.468731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kentucky","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.23704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.233881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Group psychotherapy","weight":0.113089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_psychotherapy"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Focus group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Licensed Professional Counselor","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensed_Professional_Counselor"},{"name":"Computer programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"},{"name":"Isolationism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"San Diego","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Barriers","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barriers"},{"name":"Hamper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamper"}]}
