{"id":83741,"title":"Laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure.","abstract":"Reestablishing continuity after a Hartmann's procedure is considered a major surgical procedure with high morbidity/mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the short-/long-term outcome of laparoscopic restoration of bowel continuity after HP. A prospectively collected database of colorectal laparoscopic procedures (>800) performed between June 2005 and June 2013 was used to identify 20 consecutive patients who had undergone laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure (LHR). Median age was 65.4. Ten patients (50 %) had undergone surgery for perforated diverticulitis, 3 (15 %) for cancer, and 7 (35 %) for other reasons (volvulus, posttraumatic perforation, and sigmoid perforation from foreign body). Previous HP had been performed laparoscopically in only 3 patients. Median operative time was 162.5 min. All the procedures were completed laparoscopically. Intraoperative complication rate was nil. Post-operative mortality and morbidity were respectively 0 and 10 % (1 pneumonia, 1 bowel obstruction from post-anastomotic stenosis which required resection and redo of the anastomosis). Median time to first flatus was 3 days, to normal diet 5 days. Median hospital stay was 9 days without readmissions. We followed up the patients for a median of 44 months: when asked, all 20 (100 %) said they would undergo the operation (LHR) again; 3 (15 %) had been re-operated of laparoscopic mesh repair for incisional hernia. When performed by experienced surgeons, LHR is a feasible, safe, reproducible operation, which allows early return of bowel function, early discharge and fast return to work for the patient. It has a low morbidity rate.","date":"2014-12-06","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25262377","annotations":[{"name":"Diverticulitis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulitis"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.775896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.764297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Flatulence","weight":0.709644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatulence"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.700939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.616339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.565244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Volvulus","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvulus"},{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.453168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.353195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.28582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Incisional hernia","weight":0.13109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisional_hernia"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"London Heathrow Airport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Hewlett-Packard","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard"}]}
