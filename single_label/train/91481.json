{"id":91481,"title":"[Design and clinical application of surgical device for closed reduction of tibial fracture].","abstract":"To describe a surgical device for dosed reduction of tibial fracture and investigate its clinical effectiveness.Between June 2010 and December 2012, 24 cases of tibial fractures were treated with intramedullary nailing using a surgical device for closed reduction. There were 18 males and 6 females with an average age of 40 years (range, 20-64 years). All fractures were closed. There were 3 proximal third fractures, 12 middle third fractures, and 9 distal third fractures. According to AO classification, 12 cases were classified as type A, 8 cases as type B, and 4 cases as type C. The mean time between injury and operation was 3 days (range, 1-12 days). The intraoperative fluoroscopy frequency to confirm closed reduction and guide wire passing the fracture site, and the duration between fracture reduction and nail insertion were recorded. The injured limb alignment and fracture angular deformity were measured as described by Freedman et al. The fuction of affected limb was estimated by Johner-Wruhs criteria.Closed reduction was successfully performed in 24 patients. The mean fluoroscopy frequency to confirm closed reduction was 3 (range, 2-5). The fluoroscopy frequency to confirm guide wire passing the fracture site was 2. The mean duration between fracture reduction and nail insertion was 30 minutes (range, 20-42 minutes). No intraoperative or postoperative complication occurred, such as infection, vessel and nerve injuries. All incisions healed by first intention. Seventeen patients were followed up 6-16 months (mean, 10 months). Radiographic evidence showed that bridging callous was observed at 2-4 months (mean, 2.5 months). The injured limb alignment was normal on anteroposterial and lateral radiographs at 5 months postoperatively, no malalignment and obvious angular deformity was observed. The internal fixator had good position. According to Johner-Wruhs criteria for evaluation of the affected limb function, the results were excellent in 12 cases and good in 5 cases with an excellent and good rate of 100%.The surgical device for closed reduction of tibial fracture is simple and easy to use, and has good effectiveness combined with intramedullary nailing.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Wounds and
