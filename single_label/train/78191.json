{"id":78191,"title":"Rate of language growth in children with hearing loss in an auditory-verbal early intervention program.","abstract":"This longitudinal study explored the rate of language growth of children in an early intervention program providing auditory-verbal therapy. A retrospective investigation, the study applied a linear growth model to estimate a mean growth curve and the extent of individual variation in language performance on the Preschool Language Scale, 4th ed. (PLS-4; Zimmerman, Steiner, & Pond, 2002) for 24 children with hearing loss in a convenience sample. A statistically significant change in raw scores was observed across 6-month intervals. However, growth in standard scores did not show statistically significant predictable change across the 6-month intervals. Scores on the language measure were closer to expectations for younger peers with normal hearing when compared to data reported for the PLS-4 normative sample. Language outcomes varied significantly for individual children based on time spent in early intervention, suggesting that intervention was contributing to growth.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745108","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.518067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.514593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.46297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.312859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0671077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Linear function","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Time-based currency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_currency"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Early childhood intervention","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood_intervention"},{"name":"Closer (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)"},{"name":"Pond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pond"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Growth curve","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_curve"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Rudolf Steiner","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"},{"name":"Exogenous growth model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogenous_growth_model"}]}
