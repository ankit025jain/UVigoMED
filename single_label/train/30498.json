{"id":30498,"title":"DSM-5 gambling disorder: prevalence and characteristics in a substance use disorder sample.","abstract":"The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) replaced the fourth edition's (DSM-IV) diagnosis of Pathological Gambling (PG) with Gambling Disorder (GD). GD differs from PG in that it requires 4 rather than 5 criteria for diagnosis and excludes the \"Illegal Acts\" criterion. We examined the prevalence of GD and its characteristics and validity in a substance-use disorder (SUD) sample. Participants (N = 6,613) in genetic studies of substance dependence underwent a semistructured psychiatric interview. Individuals who reported ever having gambled $10 at least monthly (n = 1,507) were the focus of the analyses. Approximately one third of acknowledged gamblers (n = 563; 8.5% of the total sample) received PG (DSM-IV) and GD (DSM-5) diagnoses and 678 (10.3% of the total) received only a DSM-5 diagnosis, representing an increase of 20.4% relative to DSM-IV. Although the 3 groups were comparable demographically, the DSM-5-Only group was intermediate between the other 2 groups on the prevalence of comorbid SUDs, the distribution of DSM-IV PG criteria endorsed, and the types of gambling reported. Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that the DSM-5-Only group was more likely than the No-Diagnosis group and less likely than the Both-Diagnoses group to acknowledge a gambling problem. In conclusion, there was a high prevalence of PG in this SUD sample. Analysis of non-DSM variables suggested that the increased sensitivity of the DSM-5 GD diagnosis successfully identifies a broader set of individuals with clinically significant gambling-related problems. Prospective studies of individuals with GD are needed to validate this finding.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490711","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.88253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Problem gambling","weight":0.729208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.698868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.688474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Gambling","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.547016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.451315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.430845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.381533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.338097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.240597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Multinomial logit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logit"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Acts of the Apostles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_the_Apostles"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
