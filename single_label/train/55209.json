{"id":55209,"title":"Refractive corneal inlay for near vision improvement after cataract surgery.","abstract":"We present the case of a patient who had refractive corneal inlay implantation for near vision improvement after bilateral cataract surgery. The patient had a history of bilateral cataract, and a 2-step procedure was suggested to improve her near and distance visual acuities. The first step was bilateral cataract extraction with a power target of plano intraocular lens implantation. Six months later, a refractive corneal inlay, Presbia Microlens, was implanted in the nondominant eye in the intracorneal pocket made with the femtosecond laser. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. The bilateral uncorrected near visual acuity improved from less than Jaeger (J)6 to J1 and remained stable during the 2-year follow-up. The refractive corneal inlay is a safe, simple, and efficient method for improving near visual acuity in patients after cataract surgery.Dr. Pallikaris is the chair of the medical advisory board of Presbia Co√∂peratief U.A.
