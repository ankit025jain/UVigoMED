{"id":87048,"title":"Measles and rubella vaccination coverage in Haiti, 2012: progress towards verifying and challenges to maintaining measles and rubella elimination.","abstract":"We conducted a nationwide survey to assess measles containing vaccine (MCV) coverage among children aged 1-9 years in Haiti and identify factors associated with vaccination before and during the 2012 nationwide supplementary immunisation activities (SIA).Haiti was stratified into five geographic regions (Metropolitan Port-au-Prince, North, Centre, South and West), 40 clusters were randomly selected in each region, and 35 households were selected per cluster.Among the 7000 visited households, 75.8% had at least one child aged 1-9 years; of these, 5279 (99.5%) households consented to participate in the survey. Of 9883 children enrolled, 91% received MCV before and/or during the SIA; 31% received MR for the first time during the SIA, and 50.7% received two doses of MCV (one before and one during the 2012 SIA). Among the 1685 unvaccinated children during the SIA, the primary reason of non-vaccination was caregivers not being aware of the SIA (31.0%). Children aged 1-4 years had significantly lower MR SIA coverage than those aged 5-9 years (79.5% vs. 84.8%) (P < 0.0001). A higher proportion of children living in the West (12.3%) and Centre (11.2%) regions had never been vaccinated than in other regions (4.8-9.1%). Awareness, educational level of the mother and region were significantly associated with MR vaccination during and before the SIA (P < 0.001).The 2012 SIA successfully increased MR coverage; however, to maintain measles and rubella elimination, coverage needs to be further increased among children aged 1-4 years and in regions with lower coverage.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041586","annotations":[{"name":"Measles","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Haiti","weight":0.576941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.449993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.329404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.260136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.154529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Rubella","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubella"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"1685","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1685"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Metropolitan bishop","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_bishop"},{"name":"Supplementary angles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_angles"},{"name":"Government of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"2012 (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_(film)"},{"name":"Sia","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sia"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"}]}
