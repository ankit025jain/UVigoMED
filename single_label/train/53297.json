{"id":53297,"title":"Valproic acid downregulates NF-?B p50 activity and IRAK-1 in a progressive thyroid carcinoma cell line.","abstract":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) valproic acid (VPA) is a promising drug, currently in clinical phase 2, for the therapy of advanced/poorly differentiated thyroid cancer. The nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) pathway is constitutively activated in most tumors, including thyroid carcinomas; this often contributes to aggressive tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. We hypothesized that VPA could be useful to decrease NF-?B activity in human thyroid cancer cells. To clarify this, we treated the highly progressive thyroid cancer cell line BHT-101 with VPA (1.0-3.0 mM) for 48 h. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot were used to measure expression of NF-?B-regulatory genes and proteins. NF-?B p50 activity was measured using an ELISA-based colorimetric transcription factor assay kit. We found that VPA significantly and dose-dependently impaired NF-?B activity reducing DNA binding activity of NF-?B p50 subunit by 30% at 1 mM, 40% at 1.5 mM, and 70% at 3 mM. Expression of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) protein, an upstream mediator of NF-?B activation, was reduced by ?30% at 1 and 1.5 mM. Furthermore, 3 mM VPA treatment significantly decreased expressions of IRAK-1, phospho-I?B? and NF-?B p50 subunit protein by ??50%. This is the first study to demonstrate that VPA decreases NF-?B activity in a progressive thyroid cancer cell line. Intriguingly, 1mM of VPA, a clinically safe dose in the therapeutic range for epilepsy, was sufficient to reduce NF-?B activity. Thus, VPA may be a promising agent to overcome chemoresistance in cancer therapy and to improve therapeutic efficiency.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Endocrine System
