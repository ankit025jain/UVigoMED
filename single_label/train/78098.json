{"id":78098,"title":"[On the necessity of standardization of objective methods for the study of hearing function in children presenting with acute inflammatory diseases of the middle ear at the level of outpatient treatment].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to standardize the frequency of objective evaluation of the hearing function in the children presenting with acute inflammatory diseases of the middle ear at the level of the outpatient treatment. The studies carried out to this effect with the use of modern and readily available audiological method revealed functional disorders in the middle ear of more than 50% of the children suffering from acute non-perforative otitis even after the elimination of the clinical signs of inflammation. The complete restoration of the functional state of the middle ear was documented in all the patients following the rehabilitative treatment. The authors proposed the algorithm for the examination of the children presenting with acute inflammatory diseases of the middle ear with special reference to the optimal frequency of diagnostic studies.
