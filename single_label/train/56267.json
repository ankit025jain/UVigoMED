{"id":56267,"title":"Diagnostic capacity of the keratoconus match index and keratoconus match probability in subclinical keratoconus.","abstract":"To evaluate the diagnostic capacity of the Ocular Response Analyzer's keratoconus match index (KMI) and keratoconus match probability (KMP) classification in keratoconus-suspect eyes.Department of Ophthalmology, University Clinics Saarland, Homburg, Germany.Comparative case series.The KMI and KMP parameters in keratoconus-suspect eyes and normal eyes (control group) were compared. The quantitative keratoconus percentage index was calculated for all suspect eyes. According to the thinnest corneal thickness (TCT), keratoconus-suspect eyes were divided into 2 subgroups: subgroup 1 (TCT <520 ?m) and subgroup 2 (TCT >520 ?m). The KMI's overall predictive accuracy was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The relationship between KMI and a series of Scheimpflug-derived keratoconus-related indices was evaluated using Spearman analysis.The mean KMI was 0.41 ± 0.29 (SD) in the keratoconus-suspect group (50 eyes) and 0.94 ± 0.29 in the control group (50 eyes) (P<.001). Nonsignificant KMI differences were detected between the keratoconus-suspect subgroups (subgroup 1, 27 eyes; subgroup 2, 23 eyes) (P=.059). Nonsignificant correlations were found between Scheimpflug indices and the KMI. The KMP identified 27.65% of control eyes as keratoconus suspect and 10.71%, 28.57%, and 3.57% of keratoconus-suspect eyes as being normal, having mild keratoconus, or having moderate keratoconus, respectively. The ROC analysis for the KMI indicated a predictive accuracy of 94% (cutoff point 0.72).The KMI seems to be a valuable index in the early diagnosis of keratoconus-suspect eyes. The KMP identified a significant percentage of topographically defined keratoconus-suspect eyes as normal or keratoconic.No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713585","annotations":[{"name":"Probability","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.773581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.208152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.0720639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0509955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Saarland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saarland"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Comparative case","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_case"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Spearman's rank correlation coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Suspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"Scheimpflug principle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheimpflug_principle"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"KM Produce","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KM_Produce"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Ownership","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Tri-State Christian Television","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-State_Christian_Television"}]}
