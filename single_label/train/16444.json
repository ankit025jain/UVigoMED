{"id":16444,"title":"Regimental Medical Officer Charles McKerrow: saving lives on the Western Front.","abstract":"Ayrshire general practitioner Charles McKerrow was appointed regimental medical officer (RMO) to the 10th Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers in 1915. At this time, fundamental restructuring of the military medical service on the Western Front had two main effects: surgical capability was moved forward as close to the front as possible and specialist stretcher bearers were trained to apply emergency first aid at the place of injury and to triage casualties appropriately. The specialist stretcher bearers were the equivalent of today's combat medical technicians. The reorganisation was undertaken in a rapid, improvised 'bottom-up' manner and there are very few official records to detail the process. McKerrow and RMOs of his calibre were integral to the successful implementation and operation of this reorganisation so their personal archives are the primary sources for its history. McKerrow's record is particularly detailed and insightful on the process; he was not only an extraordinarily fine medical officer but also provided expert testimony on a period of military medical change that was enduringly successful.
