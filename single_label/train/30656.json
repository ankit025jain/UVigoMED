{"id":30656,"title":"[Technical specifications for intensive hospital safety monitoring of post-marketing Chinese medicine (draft version for comments)].","abstract":"It is of vital significance to conduct active post-marketing surveillance of Chinese medicine, as an active response to laws, rules and guidelines issued by the China food and drug administration. The standards for technological specifications based on expert consensus have been drafted. These will provide technological support in evaluating adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or adverse drug events (ADEs). The technological specifications for post-marketing surveillance focus on two surveillance designs; one is a large sample registry study to explore general population ADR/ADE characteristics, the other is a nested case-control study to explore the characteristic and mechanisms of ADRs.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471304","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.773635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"China","weight":0.704482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.444241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.326483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.210315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Postmarketing surveillance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmarketing_surveillance"},{"name":"Specification (technical standard)","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)"},{"name":"Conscription","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription"},{"name":"Safety monitoring","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_monitoring"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"}]}
