{"id":65681,"title":"Diffusion-weighted imaging of the male pelvis.","abstract":"Diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging is playing an increasingly important role in disease detection, prognostication, and monitoring of treatment response. Particularly in the realm of oncology, the potential applications for DW imaging continue to expand. In this article, the authors detail the role of DW imaging for pathologic processes involving the male pelvis. The authors describe the current data, new insights, and ongoing controversies regarding DW imaging of the male pelvis with a particular emphasis on oncologic applications. The authors also discuss imaging techniques and common pitfalls for DW imaging in this anatomic region.
