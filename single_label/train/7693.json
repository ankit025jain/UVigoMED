{"id":7693,"title":"The role of P2Y?? receptor and activated platelets during inflammation.","abstract":"Platelets play an important role not only during thrombosis, but also in modulating immune responses through their interaction with immune cells and by releasing inflammatory mediators upon activation. The P2Y12 receptor is a Gi-coupled receptor that not only regulates ADP-induced aggregation but can also dramatically potentiate secretion, when platelets are activated by other stimuli. Considering the importance of P2Y12 receptor in platelet function, a class of antiplatelet drugs, thienopyridines, have been designed and successfully used to prevent thrombosis. This review will focus on the role of activated platelets in inflammation and the effects that P2Y12 antagonism exerts on the inflammatory process. A change in platelet functions was noted in patients treated with thienopyridines during inflammatory conditions, suggesting that platelets may modulate the inflammatory response. Further experiments in a variety of animal models of diseases, such as sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis and pulmonary inflammation have also demonstrated that activated platelets influence the inflammatory state. Platelets can secrete inflammatory modulators in a P2Y12-dependent manner, and, as a result, directly alter the inflammatory response. P2Y12 receptor may also be expressed in other cells of the immune system, indicating that thienopyridines could directly influence the immune system rather than only through platelets. Overall the results obtained to date strongly support the notion that activated platelets significantly contribute to the inflammatory process and that antagonizing P2Y12 receptor can influence the immune response.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24845219","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.806801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.790162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.750864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.665631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.561899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.464781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.450118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Inflammatory mediators","weight":0.434773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_mediators"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.0682051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"}]}
