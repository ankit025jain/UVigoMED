{"id":89489,"title":"[Lobenhoffer approach to stabilize fractures of the posteromedial tibial plateau].","abstract":"To provide the first description in Spanish of the Lobenhoffer approach to treat fractures of the posteromedial region of the tibial plateau.We report 14 clinical cases of patients with fractures of the posteromedial region of the tibia treated at our service using the Lobenhoffer approach.All patients were retrospectively assessed after a minimum follow-up period of two years. Complications and the knee status and function were assessed using the Knee Society System (KSS) score. Knee status results were good to excellent, while functional results were excellent to good in 8 patients, fair in 3 and poor in the 3 remaining ones.The Lobenhoffer approach represents and easy and reproducible posterior approach and has a low complication rate.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716369","annotations":[{"name":"Knee","weight":0.325146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.254524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.227918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.17571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.148052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Federal Security Service (Russia)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service_(Russia)"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
