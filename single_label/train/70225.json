{"id":70225,"title":"Adipose tissue concentrations of persistent organic pollutants and total cancer risk in an adult cohort from Southern Spain: preliminary data from year 9 of the follow-up.","abstract":"There is an increasing trend in the incidence of cancer worldwide, and it has been accepted that environmental factors account for an important proportion of the global burden. The present paper reports preliminary findings on the influence of the historical exposure to a group of persistent organic pollutants on total cancer risk, at year 9 in the follow-up of a cohort from Southern Spain. A cohort of 368 participants (median age 51 years) was recruited in 2003. Their historical exposure was estimated by analyzing residues of persistent organic pollutants in adipose tissue. Estimation of cancer incidence was based on data from a population-based cancer registry. Statistical analyses were performed using multivariable Cox-regression models. In males, PCB 153 concentrations were positively associated with total cancer risk, with an adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.20 (1.01-1.41) for an increment of 100 ng/g lipid. Our preliminary findings suggest a potential relationship between the historical exposure to persistent organic pollutants and the risk of cancer in men. However, these results should be interpreted with caution and require verification during the future follow-up of this cohort.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25217999","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.784582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.734738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.619298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.586575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.42551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.412673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.338934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Persistent organic pollutant","weight":0.323079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.320957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.212801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.105475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.0650786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Polychlorinated biphenyl","weight":0.0622514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Education in Northern Ireland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Northern_Ireland"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Trigraph (orthography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigraph_(orthography)"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
