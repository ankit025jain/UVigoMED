{"id":53023,"title":"Olfactory dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus: an additional manifestation of microvascular disease?","abstract":"We evaluated olfactory dysfunction in 154 adults (74 men, mean age 60.9Â±11.9 years), of whom 119 had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Olfactory function was assessed with \"Sniffin' Sticks.\" A total Threshold-Discrimination-Identification (TDI) score was calculated. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were associated with lower olfactory scores (all TDI scores<0.001). Age was negatively associated with odor threshold, odor identification, and TDI score (P=.009, <.001, and <.001, respectively). After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease, only T2DM and hypertension were associated with TDI score (R square=0.281). Diabetic complications were associated with olfactory dysfunction (P=.006): TDI scores were lower in the presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (P=.017) and retinopathy (P=.047). In conclusion, T2DM and hypertension are independently associated with olfactory dysfunction while diabetic peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy are significantly associated with lower olfactory scores. The clinical relevance of these findings needs to be further examined.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24554429","annotations":[{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.859657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.857718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.846149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.845879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diabetic neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.767016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Microangiopathy","weight":0.698359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microangiopathy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.659262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Olfaction","weight":0.324044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.205451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.190214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Odor","weight":0.157091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odor"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
