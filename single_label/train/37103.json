{"id":37103,"title":"V-shape reduction plasty to reduce the neoaortic root-ascending aorta discrepancy in children undergoing arterial switch operation.","abstract":"Preoperative aortopulmonary mismatch is considered a risk factor for the development of aortic insufficiency after surgery for transposition of the great arteries. We have approached these children using a neoaortic root reduction plasty. Five children with severe PA-AO discrepancy (median age 57 days) underwent arterial switch operation (ASO) associated with a V-shape neoaortic reduction plasty. At follow-up aortic regurgitation remains stable in all patients and no supra-aortic obstruction and/or neoaortic root dilatation were observed.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517442","annotations":[{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.707957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Aortic insufficiency","weight":0.649283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_insufficiency"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.563323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.306296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Transposition of the great vessels","weight":0.298887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_of_the_great_vessels"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.189214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Switch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Amaury Sport Organisation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaury_Sport_Organisation"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Jatene procedure","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatene_procedure"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Transposon","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposon"}]}
