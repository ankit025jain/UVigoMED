{"id":1185,"title":"What are the potential implications of identifying intracranial internal carotid artery atherosclerotic lesions on cone-beam computed tomography? A systematic review and illustrative case studies.","abstract":"A systematic literature review was performed to examine the clinical implications of intracranial internal carotid artery calcific atherosclerotic lesions (IICACALs) detected at cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) examinations.The PubMed database was queried in 2 separate searches using the linked search terms non-contrast enhanced cone beam computed tomography and calcified intracranial vascular lesions and non-contrast enhanced computed tomography and calcified intracranial vascular lesions. Reviewed were all English-language articles using CBCT or CT imaging that enrolled neurologically asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Excluded were studies describing patients with hemorrhagic stroke. Illustrative cases describing incidentally detected IICACALs on CBCT scans are provided.Three articles described identification of IICACALs on CBCT scans of almost 1,500 dental patients. Two of these fully addressed the subject, with 1 noting that IICACALs were benign and another urging patient referral for further workup. Five non-contrast-enhanced CT studies were evaluated in detail; all confirmed IICACALs as a substantive risk marker of advanced stenotic disease in the cerebral circulation, central brain atrophy, concomitant advanced atherosclerotic disease in the cardiovascular circulation, and an indicator of future ischemic events. Five CBCT examinations showing IICACALs in the cavernous and ophthalmic segments are presented.Few studies have denoted the importance of identifying IICACALs on CBCT scans. However, all non-contrast-enhanced CT studies emphasized the clinical significance of these lesions in relation to cerebral and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, IICACALs seen on CBCT and CT scans present the same risk and should prompt referral for further evaluation.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25438276","annotations":[{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.861965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.840208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Internal carotid artery","weight":0.773069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Cerebral circulation","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_circulation"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.74978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Hemorrhagic stroke","weight":0.723003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemorrhagic_stroke"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.586326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.370838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.328635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.323631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Cerebral atrophy","weight":0.116723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_atrophy"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.112973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0585634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Cavernous sinus","weight":0.0362205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavernous_sinus"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Spiral computed tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
