{"id":29502,"title":"Acute mycophenolate overdose: case series and systematic literature analysis.","abstract":"Literature regarding acute human toxicity of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) is limited.Our objectives were to describe all cases of overdose with MMF or EC-MPS reported to the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre (STIC) or in the literature between 1995 and 2013. Therefore, we performed an observational case-series and systematic literature search to determine circumstances, magnitude, management and outcome of overdose with MMF or EC-MPS.Of 152,762 reports to STIC, 15 (7 pediatric) involved overdose with MMF (n = 13) or EC-MPS (n = 2). Three cases from other centers were identified from a systematic literature search. The magnitude of overdose ranged from 1.2 to 16.7 (median 2.9) times usual dose. Six (33%) MMF overdoses had attributable symptoms, which included abdominal pain, vomiting, headache and dizziness. The majority of findings were minor, although a 9-fold MMF overdose caused hypotension 8 h after ingestion and a 12.5-fold overdose caused leukopenia after 5 days. Symptoms did not occur in patients who took 2.5 times or less of their usual MMF dose. Gastrointestinal decontamination measures with activated charcoal were undertaken in one-third of cases.Acute MMF and EC-MPS overdoses had a favorable outcome in all cases reported to STIC and in the literature.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655210","annotations":[{"name":"Activated carbon","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_carbon"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.457647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.407917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Charcoal","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcoal"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.120262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mycophenolate mofetil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolate_mofetil"},{"name":"Literary criticism","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_criticism"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"762","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/762"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Centre (French region)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(French_region)"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Human decontamination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_decontamination"}]}
