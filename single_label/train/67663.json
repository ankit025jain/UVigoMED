{"id":67663,"title":"Microbial pathogenicity: a new approach to drug development.","abstract":"Pathogenic microorganisms, particularly pathogenic bacteria that cause debilitating diseases, are considered a threat for human health and well-being. Infectious diseases are rampant, particularly in developing countries. However, there are many other deadly diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiac malfunction, etc., that account for significant loss of life and trauma in our society. In this article, I try to describe the role certain bacterial pathogens with long term residence in the human body can play in providing us with our next generation anticancer and other drugs, demonstrating that a certain amount of good can come out of such bacterial pathogens as well.
