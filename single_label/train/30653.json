{"id":30653,"title":"[Establishment of model of traditional Chinese medicine injections post-marketing safety monitoring].","abstract":"To establish a nurse based post-marketing safety surveillance model for traditional Chinese medicine injections (TCMIs).A TCMIs safety monitoring team and a research hospital team engaged in the research, monitoring processes, and quality control processes were established, in order to achieve comprehensive, timely, accurate and real-time access to research data, to eliminate errors in data collection.A triage system involving a study nurse, as the first point of contact, clinicians and clinical pharmacists was set up in a TCM hospital. Following the specified workflow involving labeling of TCM injections and using improved monitoring forms it was found that there were no missing reports at the ratio of error was zero.A research nurse as the first and main point of contact in post-marketing safety monitoring of TCM as part of a triage model, ensures that research data collected has the characteristics of authenticity, accuracy, timeliness, integrity, and eliminate errors during the process of data collection. Hospital based monitoring is a robust and operable process.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471314","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.664119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.661374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.497041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.47894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.383887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"China","weight":0.257943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Triage","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.064482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Clinical pharmacy","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_pharmacy"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Church of England","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England"},{"name":"0 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)"},{"name":"Authentication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Packaging and labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling"},{"name":"Safety monitoring","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_monitoring"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Business process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Data collection","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection"},{"name":"Workflow","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow"}]}
