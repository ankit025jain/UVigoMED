{"id":29081,"title":"Human papillomavirus e7 oncoprotein transgenic skin develops an enhanced inflammatory response to 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene by an arginase-1-dependent mechanism.","abstract":"We have shown that the expression of human papillomavirus type 16 E7 (HPV16.E7) protein within epithelial cells results in local immune suppression and a weak and ineffective immune response to E7 similar to that occuring in HPV-associated premalignancy and cancers. However, a robust acute inflammatory stimulus can overcome this to enable immune elimination of HPV16.E7-transformed epithelial cells. 2,4-Dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) can elicit acute inflammation and it has been shown to initiate the regression of HPV-associated genital warts. Although the clinical use of DNCB is discouraged owing to its mutagenic potential, understanding how DNCB-induced acute inflammation alters local HPV16.E7-mediated immune suppression might lead to better treatments. Here, we show that topical DNCB application to skin expressing HPV16.E7 as a transgene induces a hyperinflammatory response, which is not seen in nontransgenic control animals. The E7-associated inflammatory response is characterized by enhanced expression of Th2 cytokines and increased infiltration of CD11b(+)Gr1(int)F4/80(+)Ly6C(hi)Ly6G(low) myeloid cells, producing arginase-1. Inhibition of arginase with an arginase-specific inhibitor, N(omega)-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine, ameliorates the DNCB-induced inflammatory response. Our results demonstrate that HPV16.E7 protein enhances DNCB-associated production of arginase-1 by myeloid cells and consequent inflammatory cellular infiltration of skin.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732401","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Transgene","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgene"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Genital wart","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genital_wart"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.658496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Mutagen","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagen"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Wart","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wart"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Myelocyte","weight":0.258175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelocyte"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Arginase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginase"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Thorium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"}]}
