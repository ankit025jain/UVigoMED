{"id":71522,"title":"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 regulates infiltration of macrophages into melanoma via phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr?Â²?.","abstract":"Tumor-infiltrating macrophages are potential candidates for cancer immunotherapy. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying macrophage infiltration into tumors is poorly understood. Based on our previous finding that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) enhances vitronectin-dependent migration of macrophages, we investigated the potential role of PAI-1 in macrophage invasion into melanoma. Experimental evidence obtained from spheroid confrontation assay clearly showed that PAI-1 overexpression significantly enhanced the invasion of RAW 264.7 cells into B16F10 melanoma. We further demonstrated that PAI-1 induces phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at Tyr(925), which, in turn, mediated the invasion of macrophages into the melanoma. This work further illustrates that low-density lipoprotein receptor related-protein 1 (LRP1) is essential for PAI-1-mediated FAK phosphorylation and macrophage invasion into melanoma. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a novel role of PAI-1 in macrophage invasion into melanoma and provides insights into the underlying molecular mechanism.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25063025","annotations":[{"name":"PTK2","weight":0.877087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTK2"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.828112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.802046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.734591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Focal adhesion","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_adhesion"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1","weight":0.707117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator_inhibitor-1"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.705784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.703722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.646133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.539949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.446829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.40073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator","weight":0.213824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Cancer immunotherapy","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_immunotherapy"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Spheroid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid"},{"name":"LRP1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRP1"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Live action role-playing game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game"},{"name":"264","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/264"},{"name":"925","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/925"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Factor X","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_X"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
