{"id":34624,"title":"Changes in NT-proBNP in young children with congenital heart malformations.","abstract":"We measured serum NT-proBNP levels in 2 groups of young patients (0-36 months) with congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to congenital heart malformations (CHM).The first group included 23 patients prior to surgery for heart malformations. The second group included 12 patients with CHM within 24 hours post-operation. NT-proBNP levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent immunoassay (ELISA) using the Chem Well 2910 (Awareness Technology Inc.) automated analyzer.NT-proBNP values were 4 times higher in patients with unoperated CHM compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001), and 12 times higher in patients with CHM 24 hours after surgery compared to controls (P = 0.0001).These results demonstrated significant changes in NT-proBNP concentrations before and after surgery to correct congenital heart malformations.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719984","annotations":[{"name":"NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship","weight":0.260092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NWA_Pacific_Northwest_Tag_Team_Championship"},{"name":"List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)","weight":0.19946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Tag_Team_Champions_(WWE)"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.127325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Automated analyser","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_analyser"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Analyser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyser"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Microsoft Compiled HTML Help","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Compiled_HTML_Help"}]}
