{"id":81492,"title":"A randomized controlled clinical trial to assess the desensitizing effect of a stannous fluoride dentifrice.","abstract":"To assess the dentin hypersensitivity-reducing effectiveness of a 0.454% stannous-containing dentifrice as compared to a marketed negative control dentifrice after the first brushing as well as after 3 days and 2 weeks of twice daily use.This was a 2-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, single-center clinical investigation in confirmed dentin hypersensitivity adult sufferers. At baseline, subjects were stratified by age, gender, and thermal sensitivity scores, and randomly assigned to a marketed 0.454% stannous fluoride (SnF2) dentifrice or a marketed sodium fluoride (NaF) dentifrice negative control. Following baseline assessment of tactile and thermal sensitivity via the Yeaple Probe and air-blast/Schiff Air Index evaluations, respectively, subjects brushed once on-site with their assigned test product following the same usage instructions. Post-brushing tactile and thermal sensitivity were then assessed ('Immediate' evaluation). Subjects subsequently brushed twice daily at home for a 2-week period, with the same tactile and thermal efficacy evaluations repeated at Day 3 and Week 2 post-baseline.All 116 enrolled subjects completed all evaluations. The stannous fluoride dentifrice provided significantly (P < 0.0001) superior dentin hypersensitivity reduction compared to the negative control dentifrice at each time point and by both evaluation measures: superior mean relative Yeaple Probe (tactile) benefits were 124.5% after one use, 203.8% after 3 days, and 222.5% after 2 weeks; and superior mean relative Schiff Air Index (thermal) benefits were 27.6% after a single use, 44.6% at Day 3, and 74.2% at Week 2. Both dentifrices were well-tolerated.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000669","annotations":[{"name":"Sodium fluoride","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.7839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.657353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.540719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.403001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.353535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.222685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Tin(II) fluoride","weight":0.148912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_fluoride"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Dentifrice","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentifrice"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Immediate Records","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_Records"},{"name":"Thermal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal"},{"name":"Brushed metal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushed_metal"},{"name":"Tin(II) chloride","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_chloride"},{"name":"222","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/222"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"24 (season 3)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(season_3)"},{"name":"Cat allergy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_allergy"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Test market","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_market"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"}]}
