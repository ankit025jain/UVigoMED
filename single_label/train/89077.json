{"id":89077,"title":"Biomechanical analysis of the efficacy of locking plates during cyclic loading in metacarpal fractures.","abstract":"To analyse the biomechanical characteristics of locking plates under cyclic loading compared to a nonlocking plate in a diaphyseal metacarpal fracture.Oblique diaphyseal shaft fractures in porcine metacarpal bones were created in a biomechanical fracture model. An anatomical reduction and stabilization with a nonlocking and a comparable locking plate in mono- or bicortical screw fixation followed. Under cyclic loading, the displacement, and in subsequent load-to-failure tests, the maximum load and stiffness were measured.For the monocortical screw fixation of the locking plate, a similar displacement, maximum load, and stiffness could be demonstrated compared to the bicortical screw fixation of the nonlocking plate.Locking plates in monocortical configuration may function as a useful alternative to the currently common treatment with bicortical fixations. Thereby, irritation of the flexor tendons would be avoided without compromising the stability, thus enabling the necessary early functional rehabilitation.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24757429","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.407387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.334462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Metacarpus","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpus"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.068677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Diaphysis","weight":0.0504415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphysis"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Continuum mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Monaural","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaural"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Drive shaft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_shaft"},{"name":"Fixation (visual)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(visual)"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Structural load","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_load"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Nitrogen fixation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
