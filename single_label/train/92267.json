{"id":92267,"title":"Acquired and genetic channelopathies: in vivo assessment of axonal excitability.","abstract":"Neuronal or axonal ion channel function can be impaired or altered in a number of disorders, such as acquired (autoantibody-mediated, toxic, and metabolic) and genetic channelopathies, and even neurodegenerative (motor neuron disease) or inflammatory diseases (multiple sclerosis, immune-mediated neuropathies). When specific channels are affected, axonal/neuronal excitability primarily alters according to original function of the corresponding channels. Separately, in the 1990s, axonal excitability testing was developed to assess ion channel function, membrane potential, and passive membrane properties non-invasively in human subjects. Using this technique, numerous papers on altered axonal excitability in a variety of disorders have been published since 2000. In a recent issue of Experimental Neurology, Park et al. demonstrated changes in peripheral axonal excitability in limbic encephalitis and acquired neuromyotonia with anti-voltage gated potassium channel antibodies. Unexpectedly, the results were not consistent with those caused by simple potassium channel blockade, suggesting that multiple other factors contribute to altered axonal excitability. In contrast it was reported that patients with episodic ataxia type 1 (genetic channelopathy with mutation of Kv1.1 channel gene) show prominent excitability changes exactly compatible with fast potassium channel blockade. This commentary aims to highlight findings of this study in a broader context, and provides possible explanations for the discrepancy of patterns of axonal excitability changes in acquired and genetic potassium channelopathies.
