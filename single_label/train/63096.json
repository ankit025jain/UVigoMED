{"id":63096,"title":"Analysis of the IGHV region in Burkitt's lymphomas supports a germinal center origin and a role for superantigens in lymphomagenesis.","abstract":"The analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) region may disclose the influence of antigens in Burkitt's lymphomas (BL). IGHV sequences from 38 patients and 35 cell lines were analyzed. IGHV3 subset genes were the most used and IGHV4-34 gene was overrepresented. IGHV genes were mutated in 98.6% of the cases, 36% acquired potential glycosylation sites, and in 52% somatic-hypermutation-process was ongoing. Binding motifs for superantigens like Staphylococcal protein A and carbohydrate I/i were preserved in 89% of the cases. IGHV analysis of BL cells supports a germinal center origin and points toward a role for superantigens in lymphomagenesis.
