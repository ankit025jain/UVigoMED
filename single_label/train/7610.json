{"id":7610,"title":"Additive interactions between 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline and clobazam in the mouse maximal electroshock-induced tonic seizure model--an isobolographic analysis for parallel dose-response relationship curves.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to characterize the anticonvulsant effect of 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1-MeTHIQ) in combination with clobazam (CLB) in the mouse maximal electroshock-induced seizure (MES) model.The anticonvulsant interaction profile between 1-MeTHIQ and CLB in the mouse MES model was determined using an isobolographic analysis for parallel dose-response relationship curves.Electroconvulsions were produced in albino Swiss mice by a current (sine wave, 25 mA, 500 V, 50 Hz, 0.2-second stimulus duration) delivered via auricular electrodes by a Hugo Sachs generator. There was an additive effect of the combination of 1-MeTHIQ with CLB (at the fixed ratios of 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1) in the mouse MES-induced tonic seizure model.The additive interaction of the combination of 1-MeTHIQ with CLB (at fixed-ratios of 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1) in the mouse MES model seems to be pharmacodynamic in nature and worth of considering in further clinical practice.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24853974","annotations":[{"name":"Sine wave","weight":0.737028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.425845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.31393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.313634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.208774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Electric generator","weight":0.204581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Ampere","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0791456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0740936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Utility frequency","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_frequency"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Clobazam","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clobazam"},{"name":"Tetrahydroisoquinoline","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydroisoquinoline"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Fundamental interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Unicode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Columbus Crew","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Crew"},{"name":"Series and parallel circuits","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits"},{"name":"The Jeevas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jeevas"},{"name":"Behavioral addiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_addiction"},{"name":"Sine","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"}]}
