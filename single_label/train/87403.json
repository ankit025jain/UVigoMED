{"id":87403,"title":"Isolated proximal rupture of flexor digitorum longus tendon in a traumatic open subtalar dislocation.","abstract":"Tendon ruptures associated with ankle fractures and dislocations or subtalar dislocations are very rare entities with only a few reports of these in the literature. We report a case of an open subtalar dislocation and associated isolated proximal rupture of the flexor digitorum longus tendon at the musculotendinous junction, following a relatively low energy trauma. The finding of the avulsed flexor digitorum longus tendon was intraoperative, and management involved thorough washout of the joint and a primary side-to-side tenodesis with the flexor hallucis longus tendon. The patient has made a good functional recovery from his injuries. This case is reported because of the rarity of this combination of injuries and the associated management dilemma with which it presented us.
