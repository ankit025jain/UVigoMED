{"id":38406,"title":"The use of custom-made shoes in patients with foot deformities in foot clinic, Siriraj Hospital.","abstract":"To study the frequency, result, and concomitant factors of the use of custom-made shoes in Foot Clinic, Siriraj Hospital.Studying from patient records and interviewing the patients who had foot deformities without numbness and received custom-made shoes from the Foot Clinic, Siriraj Hospital between January 2009 and December 2011 about the latest custom-made shoes after the first three months of use.Sixty-seven participants were reviewed and included eight males (11.9%) and 59 females (88.1%) with an average age of 57.1 years. The majority had congenital foot deformity (19.4%). Most of them received sandal-type shoes (34.3%) and total contact orthosis (52.2%). The use of custom-made shoes that the participants had to use for more than 3 days/week and for more than or equal to 50% of daily walking and standing duration was 47.8%. Using these shoes reduced foot pain and increased walking stability (p-value = 0.007 and 0.023). Factors associated with the use of custom-made shoes were no previous callus (odds ratio = 25.30, 95% CI 2.20-290.56), decreasing callus after using the shoes (odds ratio = 23.54, 95% CI 1.65-335.23), decreasing foot pain after using the shoes (odds ratio = 5.01, 95% CI 1.20-20.95), and overall satisfaction (odd ratio = 21.47, 95% CI 3.81-121.04).The use of custom-made shoes from the Foot Clinic, Siriraj Hospital was 47.8%. Using the shoes could reduce foot pain and increase walking stability. Factors associated with the use of custom-made shoes were no previous callus, decreasing callus, decreasing foot pain, and overall satisfaction.","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24428101","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.583971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.550419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Orthotics","weight":0.423819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthotics"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.305179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Paresthesia","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Callus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callus"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Siriraj Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siriraj_Hospital"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Shoe","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"2020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Parity (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Buffy vs. Dracula","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_vs._Dracula"},{"name":"Arboles, Colorado","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arboles,_Colorado"}]}
