{"id":28009,"title":"Mood, mood regulation, and frontal systems functioning in current smokers, long-term abstinent ex-smokers, and never-smokers.","abstract":"Indices of mood, mood regulation, and executive functioning were examined in 61 current smokers who have smoked daily for at least one year, 36 ex-smokers who had not smoked a cigarette for at least one year, and 86 never-smokers. All participants completed the following measures online: Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), the Negative Mood Regulation (NMR) scale, the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe), the Fagerstr√∂m Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD), and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) followed by Tukey post-hoc tests revealed significant differences (p < .01) such that current smokers indicated worse functioning than both ex-smokers and never-smokers on DASS, NMR, and FrSBe, as well as heavier drinking as measured by AUDIT. These differences remained significant even after controlling for AUDIT scores. Results most plausibly reflect a return to pre-smoking baseline brain function in long-term abstinent ex-smokers.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052789","annotations":[{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.508019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.36878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.296149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.127246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Nuclear magnetic resonance","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_Use_Disorders_Identification_Test"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.070898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Fellow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Executive functioning","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functioning"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Executive (government)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"John Tukey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Precipitation (meteorology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"}]}
