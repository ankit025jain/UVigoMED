{"id":38707,"title":"Small-molecule based musculoskeletal regenerative engineering.","abstract":"Clinicians and scientists working in the field of regenerative engineering are actively investigating a wide range of methods to promote musculoskeletal tissue regeneration. Small-molecule-mediated tissue regeneration is emerging as a promising strategy for regenerating various musculoskeletal tissues and a large number of small-molecule compounds have been recently discovered as potential bioactive molecules for musculoskeletal tissue repair and regeneration. In this review, we summarize the recent literature encompassing the past 4 years in the area of small bioactive molecules for promoting repair and regeneration of various musculoskeletal tissues including bone, muscle, cartilage, tendon, and nerve.
