{"id":47187,"title":"Etiology, clinical features and outcome of fulminant hepatic failure in pregnancy.","abstract":"To determine the etiology, clinical features and outcome of fulminant hepatic failure in pregnancy.An observational hospital based study was conducted at Isra University hospital Hyderabad from 1st March 2009 to 28th February 2010. Total 1192 obstetric patients were admitted in obstetrics & gynaecology department during this period, of whom 52 were with Fulminant hepatic failure in pregnancy and were included in this study. A pre-designed structured proforma was used. All patients had clinical history and underwent a physical examination. Routine laboratory tests, liver function tests and viral serology were performed in all cases. All results were analyzed on statistical software SPSS version 11. Frequencies and percentages were calculated, the final outcome was recorded.Out of 52, 6 (11.5%) presented in the first trimester, 4 (7.6%) in the second trimester and 42 (80.7%) were in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Etiology of the disease was Hepatitis E in 28 (53.8%), Hepatitis B in 9 (17.3%), Hepatitis C in 7 (13.5%) HELLP syndrome in 7 (13.5%) and acute fatty liver of pregnancy in 1 (3.57%) case. Maternal mortality was 15 (28.8%) and foetal mortality was 40 (77%). Only 12 (23.1%) new born remained alive.Fulminant hepatic failure in pregnancy has very high foetal and maternal mortality which is mostly due to viral hepatitis E.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601199","annotations":[{"name":"HELLP syndrome","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HELLP_syndrome"},{"name":"Acute liver failure","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Hepatitis E","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_E"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.751881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.731362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.728924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Acute fatty liver of pregnancy","weight":0.713027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_fatty_liver_of_pregnancy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.599793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.513739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.477054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fulminant","weight":0.235759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Maternal death","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
