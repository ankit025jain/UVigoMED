{"id":67517,"title":"Aortic pulse wave velocity predicts mortality in chronic kidney disease stages 2-4.","abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by aortic stiffness and increased cardiovascular mortality. In end-stage renal disease, aortic stiffness predicts mortality, whereas this role remains uncertain in mild-to-moderate CKD. We aimed to investigate whether aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) predicts mortality and renal disease progression in CKD patients.We enrolled 135 CKD patients stages 2-4 [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): 41.1 (28.5-61.6) ml/min per 1.73? m] in the study and assessed aPWV. The combined renal end-point was defined as at least 50% decline in renal function and/or start of renal replacement therapy.During the observational period of 42 (30-50) months six patients were lost of follow-up, 13 patients died and 16 patients reached the combined renal end-point. Stratification according to the mean of aPWV (10 ?m/s), Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed increased mortality with aPWV ?10 ?m/s (log-rank P?<?0.05). Stepwise logistic regression analysis confirmed aPWV as an independent predictor for mortality in CKD stage 2-4. The hazard ratio of mortality in the cohort with an aPWV at least 10 ?m/s was 5.1 (1.1-22.9). By contrast, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no effect of aPWV on the combined renal end-point (log-rank P?=?0.90).These results provide the first direct evidence that in patients with CKD stage 2-4, increased aortic stiffness determined by aPWV is a strong independent predictor of all-cause mortality.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24609217","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.811024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.741293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.639651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.583568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.521418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Renal replacement therapy","weight":0.242024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.134255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"}]}
