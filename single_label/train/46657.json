{"id":46657,"title":"Calcium intake and colorectal cancer risk: dose-response meta-analysis of prospective observational studies.","abstract":"Mechanistic and epidemiologic studies provide considerable evidence for a protective association between calcium intake and incident colorectal cancer (CRC). While the relationship has not been substantiated by short-duration randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CRC, trials do show a benefit on adenomas, a precursor to CRC. To address some of this inconsistency, we conducted dose-response meta-analyses by sources of calcium intake, based on prospective observational studies published up to December 2013 identified from PubMed, Embase, and BIOSIS. Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. For total calcium intake, each 300 mg/day increase was associated with an approximately 8% reduced risk of CRC (summary RR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.89-0.95, I(2) ?= 47%, 15 studies with 12,305 cases, intake = 250-1,900 mg/day, follow-up = 3.3-16 years). While the risk decreased less steeply in higher range of total calcium intake (P(non-linearity) ?= 0.04), the degree of curvature was mild and statistical significance of non-linearity was sensitive to one study. For supplementary calcium, each 300 mg/day increase was associated with an approximately 9% reduced risk of CRC (summary RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.86-0.98, I(2) ?= 67%, six studies with 8,839 cases, intake = 0-1,150 mg/day, follow-up = 5-10 years). The test for non-linearity was not statistically significant (P(non-linearity) ?= 0.11). In conclusion, both dietary and supplementary calcium intake may continue to decrease CRC risk beyond 1,000 mg/day. Calcium supplements and non-dairy products fortified with calcium may serve as additional targets in the prevention of CRC. RCTs of calcium supplements with at least 10 years of follow-up are warranted to confirm a benefit of calcium supplements on CRC risk.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623471","annotations":[{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.946214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.882119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.736844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.572465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.498588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.388149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.218533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Nonlinear system","weight":0.149844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.079746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Curvature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Fortification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
