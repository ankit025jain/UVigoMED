{"id":69553,"title":"Serum levels of arachidonic acid metabolites change during prostate cancer progression.","abstract":"Arachidonic acid (AA) pathway has been shown to play a role in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). In this study we aimed to assess the changes in concentrations of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) in serum samples from patients diagnosed with PCa compared to controls.HETEs were determined using ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS).Elevated concentrations of 5-HETE, 8-HETE, 11-HETE and 15-HETE were observed in 6 out of 20 patients diagnosed with PCa; no statistical differences with controls were observed for 12-HETE and AA in the discovery set. An independent validation set composed of 222 samples divided in five groups ranging from subjects with low PSA and no PCa, to patients with advanced PCa was included. In 30% of the patients in the advanced PCa group, up to ten times higher concentrations of the same set of HETEs were observed with a significant concomitant decrease of the concentration of AA. Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate that a decreased concentration of AA is a predictor of PCa biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP).From the present study we conclude that a significant association between AA and AA metabolites in serum and PCa progression exists, although serum concentrations of HETEs exhibited low sensitivity toward the diagnosis of PCa.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24435810","annotations":[{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.814343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.782049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.694102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.479743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.414705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.390881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.360144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.35922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0860629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"High Energy Transient Explorer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Energy_Transient_Explorer"},{"name":"Alcoholics Anonymous","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"222","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/222"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
