{"id":28995,"title":"Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy presenting with cardiogenic shock successfully treated with milrinone: a case report.","abstract":"We report the case of a middle age patient presenting with Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) complicated by cardiogenic shock that was successfully handled with milrinone. A 64-year old man presented with cardiogenic shock after benzodiazepine and alcohol intoxication. A slight elevation of troponin and typical left ventricular ballooning without coronary lesions suggested TTC. Within a few hours milrinone infusion normalized the cardiac index. TTC is responsible for severe transient left ventricular dysfunction occurring after physical or psychological stress. The major pathophysiological mechanism involved is disproportionate catecholamine secretion, which may stun the myocardium. We considered if treatment of this unique physiopathology with catecholamines could be dangerous in these patients and if alternative inotropes such as milrinone should be preferred.
