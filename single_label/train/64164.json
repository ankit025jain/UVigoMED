{"id":64164,"title":"Oral immunotherapy in children with IgE-mediated wheat allergy: outcome and molecular changes.","abstract":"IgE-mediated wheat allergy affects around 0.5% of the population, and current management is based on avoidance. We propose an active intervention to promote tolerance in wheat-allergic children.To investigate the efficacy and safety of an oral immunotherapy (OIT) protocol with wheat to treat IgE-mediated wheat-allergic children.Six wheat allergic patients assessed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) underwent wheat OIT with an up-dosing phase until 100 g of wheat was tolerated, followed by a 6-month maintenance phase. Tolerance to rye and oat was evaluated, as were specific IgE (sIgE) to wheat and other cereals and sIgE, slgG4, and sIgG1 to a panel of wheat proteins (alpha-amylase and trypsin inhibitors, wheat lipid transfer proteins, gliadins, and glutenins).Threshold doses in the wheat DBPCFC ranged from 6.6 g to 96.6 g. Five out of 6 (83%) patients successfully finished the up-dosing phase in 3 to 24 days; after a 6-month maintenance phase, all the patients maintained good tolerance of 100 g of wheat daily. Only 6.25% of doses in the up-dosing phase elicited mild adverse reactions. All 5 patients who successfully finished the up-dosing phase tolerated rye after OIT, and all but 1 tolerated oat as well. The median baseline wheat sIgE was 47.5 kU(A)/L, increasing to 84.55 kU(A)/L after up-dosing and decreasing to 28.75 kU(A)/L after 6 months of follow-up. None of the patients showed sIgE to 5-omega-gliadin, but alpha-amylase inhibitors were recognized by all patients. Specific IgG4 and sIgG1 increased in all patients.Our wheat OIT protocol was safe, efficient, and rapid. In our population, alpha-amylase was the major allergen.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25219106","annotations":[{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Wheat","weight":0.783148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.723532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Trypsin","weight":0.688657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypsin"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.676801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.644842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.544114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.423759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Rye","weight":0.336552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye"},{"name":"Oat","weight":0.232246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat"},{"name":"Wheat allergy","weight":0.201208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_allergy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.164821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Interventionism (politics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventionism_(politics)"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Cereals","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereals"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Trypsin inhibitor","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypsin_inhibitor"},{"name":"Plant lipid transfer proteins","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_lipid_transfer_proteins"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
