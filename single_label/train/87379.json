{"id":87379,"title":"[Impacts on analgesia and detumescence in ankle sprain treated with acupuncture at Xiaojie point combined with tendon-regulation manipulation].","abstract":"To compare the efficacy difference of analgesia and detumescence on ankle sprain among acupuncture at Xiaojie point combined with tendon regulation manipulation, acupuncture at Xiaojie point and tendon regulation manipulation.Sixty cases of ankle sprain were randomized into a combined therapy group, a Xiaojie point group and a tendon-regulation manipulation group, 20 cases in each one. The combined therapy of acupuncture at Xiaojie point and tendon regulation manipulation, the acupuncture at Xiaojie point and the simple application of tendon-regulation manipulation were applied respectively in the three groups, once a day, 3 treatments were required. The symptom score such as pain, ecchymosis, swelling and motor dysfunction and the total score were observed before and after treatment in the three groups. The different values of pain and swelling scores were compared before and after treatment in the three groups. The efficacy was compared among the groups.The total effective rate was 100.0% (20/20) in each group. But the curative rate was 85.0% (17/20) in the combined group, 65.0% (13/20) in the Xiaojie point tion manipulation group. After treatment, the symptom scores of pain, ecchymosis, swelling and motor dysfunction and the total score were all improved as compared with those before treatment in the three groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). The pain score in either the combined therapy group or Xiaojie point group was lower than that in the tendon-regulation manipulation group after treatment (0.20 -/+ 0.41, 0.15 +/- 0.37 vs 0.60 +/- 0.50, both P < 0.05). Swelling score in the Xiaojie point group was different significantly from that in the tendon-regulation manipulation 0.49 vs 06.4 vs. 20+0.41, P < 0.05). The different value of pain score in either the combined therapy group or Xiaojie point group was higher than that in the tendon-regulation manipulation group before group after treatment (0.65 bined therapy group or Xiaojie point group was higher than that in the tendon-regulation manipulation group before and after treatment (2.35 +/- 0.59, 2.45 +/- 0.51 vs 2.00 +/- 0.46, both P < 0.05). The different value of swelling score in the tendon-regulation manipulation group was higher than that in the Xiaojie point group before and after treatment (2.30 +/- 0.57 vs 1.60 +/- 0.60, P < 0.05).Acupuncture at Xiaojie point combined with tendon-regulation manipulation achieve an apparent effect of analgesia and detumescence on ankle sprain.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25233649","annotations":[{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Ecchymosis","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecchymosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.641817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Sprain","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprain"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.294999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.154924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Tardive dyskinesia","weight":0.109465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive_dyskinesia"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.102966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Point group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_group"},{"name":"Group psychotherapy","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_psychotherapy"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"1720","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1720"},{"name":"1320","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1320"},{"name":"2020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Sprained ankle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprained_ankle"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-Poinsot_polyhedra"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}]}
