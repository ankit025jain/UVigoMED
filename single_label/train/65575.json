{"id":65575,"title":"[Transurethral resection of bladder tumors: management of complications].","abstract":"As a frequent endourological procedure, transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURB) represents a major field of activity for urological surgeons. Although TURB represents an endoscopic training procedure for urology residents, there are clear requirements for the quality of the surgical procedure as such. The knowledge of possible complications and their management are essential for urologists active in the clinical field.
