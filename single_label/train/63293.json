{"id":63293,"title":"The effect of antiviral therapy on hepatitis C virus-related thrombocytopenia: a case report.","abstract":"Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura is an immunological disorder characterized by increased platelet destruction due to presence of anti-platelet autoantibodies. Hepatitis C virus infection, which is one of the most common chronic viral infections worldwide, may cause secondary chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura.We report a case of a 51-year-old Caucasian female with hepatitis C virus infection who developed a severe, reversible, immune thrombocytopenia. Platelet count was as low as 56.000/mm3, hepatitis C virus serology was positive, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase and gamma-glutamyltransferase serum levels were elevated. Disorders potentially associated with autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura were ruled out. A corticosteroid treatment was started and led to an increase in platelet count. The patient was then treated with pegylated-interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin. After four weeks of treatment hepatitis C virus - ribonucleic acid became undetectable and steroid treatment was discontinued. Six months of antiviral therapy achieved a sustained biochemical and virological response together with persistence of normal platelet count.In our case report hepatitis C virus seemed to play a pathogenic role in autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Moreover, the successful response (negative hepatitis C virus - ribonucleic acid) to tapered steroids and antiviral therapy was useful to revert thrombocytopenia.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457056","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.80334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.801103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Purpura","weight":0.647654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.553808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.310685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.287979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"}]}
