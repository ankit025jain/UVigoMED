{"id":35494,"title":"Relevance of allergy in adult asthma.","abstract":"Recent studies on asthma have demonstrated multiple phenotypes, based on the clinical characteristics of the disease. With the current interest in personalized medicine, the question arises whether the presence of allergic sensitization has any relevance for these phenotypes and the management of asthma. This review will examine the current knowledge of asthma phenotypes and the impact of atopy on asthma diagnosis and severity in adults. In addition, this review will address whether therapies targeted at the atopic axis help improve asthma outcomes, including lung function indices and exacerbations.
