Recently, targeted therapy such as the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) made huge progress in treatment of lung cancer. EGFR-TKIs, with its high selectivity and low toxicity, is the first choice for EGFR-mutated patients in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, secondary drug resistance becomes a clinical problem to be urgently resolved. In recent years, a series of preclinical studies showed that EGFR-TKI can enhance the antitumor activity of ionizing radiation. Therefore, EGFR-TKI combined with radiation is extremely promising therapy pattern for advanced NSCLC. This review will discuss the research status in EGFR-TKI and radiotherapy for advanced NSCLC.
