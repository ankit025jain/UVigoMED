{"id":51549,"title":"Influence of oral contraceptives on anthropomorphometric, endocrine, and metabolic profiles of anovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome patients.","abstract":"To evaluate the influence of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) on anthromorphometric, endocrine, and metabolic parameters in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Retrospective cross-sectional cohort study for the period 1993-2011.Tertiary university hospital.PCOS patients, who never, ever, or at time of screening were using OCPs were included. A total of 1,297 patients, of whom 827 were white, were included. All PCOS patients diagnosed according to the Rotterdam 2003 consensus criteria were divided into three groups: current users, (n = 76; 6% of total), ever users (n = 1,018; 78%), and never users (n = 203; 16%). Ever users were subdivided based on the OCP-free interval.None.Anthromorphometric (blood pressure, cycle duration) and ultrasound (follicle count, mean ovarian volume) parameters, endocrine (SHBG, testosterone, free androgen index, antim√ºllerian hormone [AMH]) and lipid profiles.Current users and ever users were compared with never users. In current users, SHBG was increased and androgen levels decreased. Patients with an OCP-free interval of <1 year had a higher mean follicle count, higher AMH level, and increased serum androgen level compared with never users. SHBG levels remained increased until 5-10 years after cessation of OCP use.OCP use causes a milder phenotypic presentation of PCOS regarding hyperandrogenism. However, it does not alter parameters associated with increased health risks.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680368","annotations":[{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.833789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.822923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Anovulation","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anovulation"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Combined oral contraceptive pill","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.744401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.702753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Sex hormone-binding globulin","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormone-binding_globulin"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.462308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hyperandrogenism","weight":0.17995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperandrogenism"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.13183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Antimullerian hormone","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimullerian_hormone"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"University","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Metabolomics","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolomics"}]}
