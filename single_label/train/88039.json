{"id":88039,"title":"Delayed presentation of an undiscovered nasopharyngeal foreign body.","abstract":"Suspected paediatric aerodigestive tract foreign body (FB) ingestion or aspiration is a commonly encountered emergency. Management may require a general anaesthetic for retrieval with bronchoscopy, laryngoscopy and oesophagoscopy, each dependent on the history and investigations of the case in question. We describe the case of a foreign body, which was missed in the nasopharynx for more than 3 years and also discuss how pressures on National Health Service (NHS) referral and follow-up patterns may have altered the time course of the eventual discovery.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925536","annotations":[{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.894492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"General anaesthetic","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthetic"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.745924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.536434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.459946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.354844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.222756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.134423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.0750336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Nasopharynx","weight":0.053079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasopharynx"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Suplex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Fullback (gridiron football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullback_(gridiron_football)"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
