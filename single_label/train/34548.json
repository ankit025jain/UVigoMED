{"id":34548,"title":"Mechanical assist devices in neonates and infants.","abstract":"Clinical advances in the field of mechanical support have led to additional treatment strategies in adult and, subsequently, pediatric heart failure management. The limited number of device options available to the pediatric population has led to a reallocation of resources in order to broaden the pediatric device armamentarium. Although there are very few device options in pediatrics, there are short-term support options that include the RotaFlow and PediMag. The longer-term support option for small children is limited to only the Berlin heart EXCOR device, which had been approved by the FDA since December 2011. There is a dire need for further device options for the pediatric patient and many devices funded by the PumpKIN program are under development to further the care of this population.
