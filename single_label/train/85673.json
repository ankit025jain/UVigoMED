{"id":85673,"title":"Current approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in Europe: the AIR survey.","abstract":"This review presents the results of the 2013 Advancing IPF Research (AIR) survey, which assessed current approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) by experienced physicians. A total of 149 physicians, predominantly from European countries, replied to the 28-question survey. The results of the AIR survey were compared with a similar survey of 509 French pulmonologists conducted by the French National Reference Centre and the Network of Regional Competence Centres for Rare Lung Diseases. A number of positive findings emerged from the AIR survey, including the high level of multidisciplinary team involvement in both diagnosis and management. This survey, when taken together with the French survey, suggests that there is still a need to improve earlier diagnosis of IPF.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881077","annotations":[{"name":"Lung","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.473472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.419163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"France","weight":0.385184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.329457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.292874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Powerlifting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting"},{"name":"Centre (French region)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(French_region)"},{"name":"Rare Ltd.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Ltd."},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 509","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_509"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"}]}
