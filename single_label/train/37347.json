{"id":37347,"title":"[Diagnosis and surgical treatment of cystic pulmonary hypoplasia with aortic blood supply].","abstract":"Cystic pulmonary hypoplasia with aortic blood supply--it is a rare inborn failure, in which the part of pulmonary tissue is developing separately from tracheo-bronchial tree and takes blood supply from systemic blood circulation. Diagnosis of the disease is a complicated, and it is necessary to apply modern radiological methods of visualization. The results of treatment of 27 patients, suffering cystic pulmonary hypoplasia with aortic blood supply, in the clinic through 50 yrs, were analyzed. All the patients were operated on.In 17 (63%) patients lobectomy was performed, in 4 (14.8%)--the left-sided lower lobe pyramid was excised, in 1 (3.7%)--the left-sided wedge resection of C(X), in 1 (3.7%)--the left-sided pulmonectomy, in 1 (3.7%)--left-sided resection of C(VIII) - C(IX). The rate of intraoperative complications--14.8%, and postoperative--7.4%. Efficacy of surgical treatment for this period constitutes 100%.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502010","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lobectomy","weight":0.758552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobectomy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.666252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.641817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.633539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hypoplasia","weight":0.614026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplasia"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tracheobronchial tree","weight":0.581534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheobronchial_tree"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.491594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.455971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Pulmonary hypoplasia","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypoplasia"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Pyramid","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0218275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Mental image","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_image"}]}
