{"id":73360,"title":"Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the bone: a review and update.","abstract":"Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a vascular tumor of low to intermediate malignancy that was initially described in the soft tissue. Since then, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma has been described in various anatomic sites including parenchymal tissues and the bone. In the bone, these tumors must not only be distinguished from other vascular tumors that can arise in this location, primarily epithelioid hemangioma and epithelioid angiosarcoma, but also from metastatic carcinoma. Discussion of the historical context and the pertinent literature on the subject forms the basis of this review.
