{"id":86948,"title":"T cell memory. Resident memory CD8 T cells trigger protective innate and adaptive immune responses.","abstract":"The pathogen recognition theory dictates that, upon viral infection, the innate immune system first detects microbial products and then responds by providing instructions to adaptive CD8 T cells. Here, we show in mice that tissue resident memory CD8 T cells (T(RM) cells), non-recirculating cells located at common sites of infection, can achieve near-sterilizing immunity against viral infections by reversing this flow of information. Upon antigen resensitization within the mouse female reproductive mucosae, CD8(+) T(RM) cells secrete cytokines that trigger rapid adaptive and innate immune responses, including local humoral responses, maturation of local dendritic cells, and activation of natural killer cells. This provided near-sterilizing immunity against an antigenically unrelated viral infection. Thus, CD8(+) T(RM) cells rapidly trigger an antiviral state by amplifying receptor-derived signals from previously encountered pathogens.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25170049","annotations":[{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.829958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.817574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.751192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.679766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.628037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.53899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.52135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.369111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.145444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Residency (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"}]}
