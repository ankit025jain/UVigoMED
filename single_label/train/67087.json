{"id":67087,"title":"[Efficiency of tolterodine in the treatment of patients with overactive bladder].","abstract":"The article presents the results of the examination and treatment of 30 patients with overactive bladder receiving M-anticholinergic drug tolterodine at a dose of 2 mg twice a day for 1 month. Evaluating the effectiveness of the drug was performed on the basis of the data on voiding diary, urodynamic changes, and results of ultrasound examination. The analysis showed that treatment with tolterodine within 15 days has a positive trend: normalization of urination was observed in 96.6% of patients, 76.6% of patients have reported decrease of the frequency of urgency urination, and episodes of imperative urinary incontinence decreased in 83.3% of patients. The therapy promoted the increase the duration and volume of urination, reduction of maximum uroflow rate, indicating that the effectiveness of treatment. On the 30th day of treatment, the vast majority (80%) of the patients reported improvement of their wellbeing.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649761","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.475067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.461656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Tolterodine","weight":0.352778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolterodine"},{"name":"Overactive bladder","weight":0.267819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladder"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Imperative mood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood"},{"name":"Energy conversion efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency"},{"name":"Diary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
