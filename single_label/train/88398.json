{"id":88398,"title":"[\"Piggyback\" shot: ballistic parameters of two simultaneously discharged airgun pellets].","abstract":"Green and Good reported an uncommon case of homicide committed with an air rifle in 1982 (Am. J. Forensic Med. Pathol. 3: 361-365). The fatal wound was unusual in that two airgun pellets were loaded in so-called \"piggyback\" fashion into a single shot air rifle. Lack of further information on the ballistic characteristics of two airgun pellets as opposed to one conventionally loaded projectile led to this investigation. The mean kinetic energy (E) of the two pellets discharged in \"piggyback\" fashion was E = 3.6 J and E = 3.4 J, respectively. In comparison, average kinetic energy values of E = 12.5 J were calculated for conventionally discharged single diabolo pellets. Test shots into ballistic soap confirmed the findings of a single entrance wound as reported by Green and Good. While the ballistic background of pellets discharged in \"piggyback\" fashion could be clarified, the reason behind this mode of shooting remains unclear.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24855739","annotations":[{"name":"Kinetic energy","weight":0.646655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Projectile","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile"},{"name":"Ballistics","weight":0.443645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.381649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Air gun","weight":0.327918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gun"},{"name":"Rifle","weight":0.200444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Single-shot","weight":0.0480512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-shot"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Forensic science","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science"},{"name":"Soap","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap"},{"name":"Diabolo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabolo"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Shooting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Normal mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mode"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Homicide","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide"}]}
