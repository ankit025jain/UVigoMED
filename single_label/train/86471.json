{"id":86471,"title":"[Progress on development and research of human bocavirus 1].","abstract":"Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) is a novel virus that mainly causes respiratory tract infection, and it has the characteristic of genome of Parvovirus, containing three open reading frames that encode non-structural proteins NS1 and NP1 and structural proteins VP1 and VP2. Circular episome is present during the rolling circle replication of HBoV1, which provides the possibility of full genome amplification and infectious clone construction to save HBoV1. The recombination between HBoV1 and HBoV2-4 occurs frequently. With the three-dimensional culture, in vitro culture of HBoV1 provides a powerful tool for research on the pathogenesis of HBoV1. This review focuses on the molecular characteristics, association with diseases, in vitro culture, diagnosis and treatment of HBoV1.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772907","annotations":[{"name":"Episome","weight":0.885167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episome"},{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cytoskeleton","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Human genome","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.68779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.658103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.633024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.556565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Rolling circle replication","weight":0.521924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_circle_replication"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.518573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Parvovirus","weight":0.369643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvovirus"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.32656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Reading frame","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_frame"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"NS1 Influenza Protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NS1_Influenza_Protein"}]}
