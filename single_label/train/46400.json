{"id":46400,"title":"Prediction of operative morbidity after pancreatic resection.","abstract":"In spite of advances in surgical techniques and perioperative management, morbidity rates after pancreatic resection have not reduced. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the Estimation of Physiologic Ability and Surgical Stress (E-PASS) scoring system could predict complications after pancreatic resection, comparing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with distal pancreatectomy (DP).We performed PD in 77 patients, and DP in 50. We evaluated correlations between morbidity after pancreatic resection and the preoperative risk score (PRS), surgical stress score (SSS) and comprehensive risk score (CRS) of the E-PASS scoring system.Except for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), complications after PD were significantly more frequent than those after DP. SSS and CRS in PD group were significantly higher than in DP group.Except for POPF, complications after pancreatic resection could be predicted using SSS and CRS of the E-PASS scoring.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634925","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.673509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.657534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.553642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Pancreatectomy","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatectomy"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0444368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Pancreatic fistula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_fistula"},{"name":"Siding Spring Survey","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siding_Spring_Survey"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.026362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Royal Society","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society"}]}
