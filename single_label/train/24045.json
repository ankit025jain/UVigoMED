{"id":24045,"title":"Rationale for eliminating Staphylococcus breakpoints for ?-lactam agents other than penicillin, oxacillin or cefoxitin, and ceftaroline.","abstract":"Due to the ongoing concern about the reliability of Staphylococcus breakpoints (interpretive criteria) for other ?-lactam agents, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recently approved the elimination of all breakpoints for antistaphylococcal ?-lactams except for penicillin, oxacillin or cefoxitin, and ceftaroline. Routine testing of penicillin and oxacillin or cefoxitin should be used to infer susceptibility for all ?-lactams with approved clinical indications for staphylococcal infections. It is critical for laboratories to reject requests for susceptibility testing of other ?-lactams against staphylococci and to indicate that susceptibility to these agents can be predicted from the penicillin and oxacillin or cefoxitin results. This article reviews ?-lactam resistance mechanisms in staphylococci, current antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting recommendations for ?-lactams and staphylococci, and microbiologic data and clinical data supporting the elimination of staphylococcal breakpoints for other ?-lactam agents.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457339","annotations":[{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.872951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.660635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.579775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.478737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.245291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Oxacillin","weight":0.180556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxacillin"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.164505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cefoxitin","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefoxitin"},{"name":"Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_and_Laboratory_Standards_Institute"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Lactam","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactam"},{"name":"Inference","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference"},{"name":"Breakpoint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
