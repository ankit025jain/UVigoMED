{"id":22925,"title":"Tuberculosis among HIV-infected patients in Stockholm, Sweden, 1987-2010: treatment outcomes and adverse reactions.","abstract":"The treatment of patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) is challenging. The aim of this study was to compare socio-demographic and clinical characteristics among HIV-infected patients before and after the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) in a Swedish cohort, and to identify factors associated with anti-TB treatment success as well as adverse reactions.This was a retrospective observational study of HIV/TB co-infected patients in Stockholm County from 1987 to 2010. The study population was stratified into an early and a late cohort (before and after the introduction of cART in 1996). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analysis.The study population comprised 127 patients; the majority were foreign-born (87%). The proportion of female patients more than doubled from the early to the late cohort, and anti-TB treatment success increased from 65% to 91%. The median duration of successful treatment was 8 months in both cohorts. Predictors of treatment success in the late cohort were cART (odds ratio (OR) 13.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-114.8) and a CD4 cell count at TB diagnosis > 200 cells/?l (OR 17.2, 95% CI 1.2-236.6). Severe adverse reactions in the late cohort occurred in 23% and were associated with the initiation of cART after TB diagnosis (OR 13.3, 95% CI 1.6-112.4).The introduction of cART was favourable for the treatment outcome of HIV-infected patients with concomitant TB. However, adverse reactions increased in patients who initiated cART during anti-TB treatment and these patients require careful attention.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24512373","annotations":[{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.84026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.777399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.772237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.710373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.706165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.641477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.618581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.610143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.599225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.561534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.449573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.382867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.377842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.324431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.210777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.129465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0902121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Stockholm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"1996","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996"},{"name":"1987","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"}]}
