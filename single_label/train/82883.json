{"id":82883,"title":"Clinical factors and self-perceived oral health.","abstract":"Self-perceived oral health is affected not only by awareness of the clinical status but also by comparisons with people of a similar age. This study explored the relative contributions of clinical variables assessing caries, periodontal status, and prosthetic status to self-perceived oral health within two age groups. Data of 891 adults (35-44 yr of age) and 760 older people (65-74 yr of age) from the Fourth German Oral Health Study (DMS IV, 2005) were evaluated. Self-perceived oral health was obtained from questionnaires. Numbers of decayed, filled, and unreplaced teeth, mean attachment loss, bleeding on probing (BOP), the presence of a fixed denture, and the presence of a removable denture were assessed. Multinomial logistic regression models were developed for both age groups, separately, using stepwise methods. For adults, unreplaced teeth, filled teeth, decayed teeth, the presence of a removable denture, and mean attachment loss were added to the final model. For older people, the presence of a removable denture, unreplaced teeth, decayed teeth, mean attachment loss, filled teeth, and BOP were included in the final model. Awareness of the relative contributions of clinical variables to self-perceived oral health is important for obtaining a clearer understanding of patients' subjective and objective self-perceptions of oral health.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495162","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.272202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.231231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.213755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.0539337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Multinomial logit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logit"},{"name":"Bleeding on probing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_on_probing"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Book of Numbers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Numbers"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"891","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/891"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Nature versus nurture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Steps and skips","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_and_skips"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"}]}
