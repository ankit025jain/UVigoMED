{"id":87221,"title":"[Three-column plate internal fixation for the treatment of complex tibial plateau fracture through antero-midline and postero-medial approaches].","abstract":"To study technique and clinical therapeutic effects of internal fixation with three-column plates for the treatment of complex tibial plateau fractures through antero-midline and postero-medial approaches.From January 2010 to December 2012, 28 patients with complex tibial plateau fractures were treated with internal fixation using three-column plates through antero-midline and postero-medial approaches. There were 17 males and 11 females, with an average age of 45.3 years old (ranged, 28 to 64 years old). Twelve patients had injuries in the left side and 16 patients had injuries in the right side. According to Schatzker classification, 12 patients were type V, 16 patients were type VI. According to three-column classification, all the patients had injuries of lateral, medial and posterior columns. The mean interval from injury to operation was 9.4 days (ranged, 6 to 15 days). The main clinical symptoms were knee joint swelling, deformity and limitation of motion before operation. The X-ray and CT showed all patients had complex tibial plateau fractures, which involved in the lateral, medial and posterior columns. The therapeutic effects were evaluated by fracture healing time, hospital for special surgery knee score (HSS) at one year after operation. The indexes such as tibial plateau-tibial shaft angle (TPA), posterior slope angle (PA) and femoral-tibial angle (FfA) were compared between immediate postoperation and one year after operation.All incisions primarily healed without postoperative complications such as infection and cutaneous necrosis. All the patients were followed up, and the duration ranged from 12 to 24 months, with a mean of 18.1 months. The bone union time ranged from 5 to 10 months (mean, 7.8 months) after operation. Knee joint swelling and pain disappeared after bony union, and joint function completely recovered. The results of hospital for special surgery knee score (HSS) was 27.81 ± 2.17 in pain, 19.52 ± 2.05 in function,15.82 ± 1.73 in passive range of motion, 8.51 ± 1.32 in muscle strength, 8.33 ± 1.08 in flexion deformity, 9.36 ± 0.52 in joint stability, and the total mean score was 89.35 ± 3.19. According to results of HSS, 20 patients got an excellent result, 5 good,2 fair and 1 poor. There were no significant differences in tibial plateau-tibial shaft angle (TPA), posterior slope angle (PA) and femoral-tibial angle (FTA) between immediate postoperation and one year after operation.Three-column plate internal fixation for the treatment of complex tibial plateau fractures through antero-midline and posteromedial approaches is effective to achieve anatomic reduction,rigid internal fixation and early functional exercise.","date":"2015-01-12","categories":"Wounds and
