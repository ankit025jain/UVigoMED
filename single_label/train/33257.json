{"id":33257,"title":"Persistent left superior vena cava in association with sinus venosus defect type of atrial septal defect and partial pulmonary venous return on 64-MDCT.","abstract":"The most common venous abnormality of the thorax is persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC), incidence being less than 0.5%. However, with congenital heart disease, it is about 6.1%. When the coronary sinus is dilated always search for PLSVC. The coronary sinus may communicate with the left atrium. This is known as an unroofed coronary sinus (UCS) and preoperatively documenting it is important. Of all the congenital cardiac anomalies, the sinus venosus defect (SVD) type of atrial septal defect (ASD) is most commonly associated with PLSVC and accounts for 4-11% of all ASDs. Multidetector CT can easily show all these abnormalities along with haemodynamics. On transoesophageal echocardiography it is difficult to characterise SVD and visualise a coronary sinus because of a limited window, contrast resolution and poor patient compliance. The complex of UCS and PLSVC is one such abnormality and its treatment requires careful assessment of other concomitant cardiac abnormalities to prevent post-treatment haemodynamic complications.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24850552","annotations":[{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.891714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Superior vena cava","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.888243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Left atrium","weight":0.842785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_atrium"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.81888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.794399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Pulmonary vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_vein"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.736997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.717758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Coronary sinus","weight":0.564644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_sinus"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.313739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.227966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Sinus venosus","weight":0.212801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_venosus"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.134133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"}]}
