{"id":50714,"title":"Weight loss, glycemic control, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in response to differential diet composition in a weight loss program in type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"To test whether a weight loss program promotes greater weight loss, glycemic control, and improved cardiovascular disease risk factors compared with control conditions and whether there is a differential response to higher versus lower carbohydrate intake.This randomized controlled trial at two university medical centers enrolled 227 overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes and assigned them to parallel in-person diet and exercise counseling, with prepackaged foods in a planned menu during the initial phase, or to usual care (UC; two weight loss counseling sessions and monthly contacts).Relative weight loss was 7.4% (95% CI 5.7-9.2%), 9.0% (7.1-10.9%), and 2.5% (1.3-3.8%) for the lower fat, lower carbohydrate, and UC groups (P < 0.001 intervention effect). Glycemic control markers and triglyceride levels were lower in the intervention groups compared with UC group at 1 year (fasting glucose 141 [95% CI 133-149] vs. 159 [144-174] mg/dL, P = 0.023; hemoglobin A1c 6.9% [6.6-7.1%] vs. 7.5% [7.1-7.9%] or 52 [49-54] vs. 58 [54-63] mmol/mol, P = 0.001; triglycerides 148 [134-163] vs. 204 [173-234] mg/dL, P < 0.001). The lower versus higher carbohydrate groups maintained lower hemoglobin A1c (6.6% [95% CI 6.3-6.8%] vs. 7.2% [6.8-7.5%] or 49 [45-51] vs. 55 [51-58] mmol/mol) at 1 year (P = 0.008).The weight loss program resulted in greater weight loss and improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760261","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.787712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Convenience food","weight":0.567703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_food"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.531045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Hemoglobin A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin_A"},{"name":"University","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"University of California, Berkeley","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
