{"id":12485,"title":"Extracellular superoxide dismutase ameliorates skeletal muscle abnormalities, cachexia, and exercise intolerance in mice with congestive heart failure.","abstract":"Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cachexia (muscle wasting) and the hallmark symptom, exercise intolerance. We have previously shown that a nitric oxide-dependent antioxidant defense renders oxidative skeletal muscle resistant to catabolic wasting. Here, we aimed to identify and determine the functional role of nitric oxide-inducible antioxidant enzyme(s) in protection against cardiac cachexia and exercise intolerance in CHF.We demonstrated that systemic administration of endogenous nitric oxide donor S-nitrosoglutathione in mice blocked the reduction of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD) protein expression, as well as the induction of MAFbx/Atrogin-1 mRNA expression and muscle atrophy induced by glucocorticoid. We further showed that endogenous EcSOD, expressed primarily by type IId/x and IIa myofibers and enriched at endothelial cells, is induced by exercise training. Muscle-specific overexpression of EcSOD by somatic gene transfer or transgenesis (muscle creatine kinase [MCK]-EcSOD) in mice significantly attenuated muscle atrophy. Importantly, when crossbred into a mouse genetic model of CHF (?-myosin heavy chain-calsequestrin), MCK-EcSOD transgenic mice had significant attenuation of cachexia with preserved whole body muscle strength and endurance capacity in the absence of reduced HF. Enhanced EcSOD expression significantly ameliorated CHF-induced oxidative stress, MAFbx/Atrogin-1 mRNA expression, loss of mitochondria, and vascular rarefaction in skeletal muscle.EcSOD plays an important antioxidant defense function in skeletal muscle against cardiac cachexia and exercise intolerance in CHF.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Animal
