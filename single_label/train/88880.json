{"id":88880,"title":"Calcaneoplasty and reattachment of the Achilles tendon for insertional tendinopathy.","abstract":"To report the one-year outcome of 44 patients treated with a novel technique of calcaneoplasty and reattachment of the Achilles tendon.15 men and 29 women (mean age, 53 years) with insertional tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon underwent calcaneoplasty, retrocalcaneal bursa excision, debridement and reattachment of the Achilles tendon with suture anchors via a lateral approach. Outcome was measured using the visual analogue score (VAS) for pain, the SF-36 health survey, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scores. Patient expectation and satisfaction were also assessed.Of the 44 patients, 37, 43, and 21 were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months. The mean VAS for pain and AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score improved significantly up to 6 months. The mean SF-36 score improved significantly up to 6 months for physical functioning, role functioning (physical), and bodily pain. Patient expectation and satisfaction also improved significantly. No patient had postoperative infections or rupture. Three patients had delayed wound healing, which resolved after simple dressings.Calcaneoplasty and reattachment of the Achilles tendon via a lateral approach for insertional tendinopathy enables early weight bearing and achieves good outcome and pain relief.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781615","annotations":[{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.763676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.37582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.316595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Achilles tendon","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.17995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.108815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.0829469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Synovial bursa","weight":0.0608789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_bursa"},{"name":"Tendinitis","weight":0.0607322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinitis"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Achilles","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Expected value","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"News presenter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Replantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replantation"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
