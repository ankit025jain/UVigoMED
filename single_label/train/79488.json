{"id":79488,"title":"Interdomal-columellar myolipoma: discovered at rhinoplasty.","abstract":"Tumors of the adipose tissue located in the nose are extremely rare. This report draws attention to the first case of nasal tip-columellar myolipoma described in the literature. During an open rhinoplasty, the authors elevated the columellar flap and approached the tip, where they found a misdiagnosed 2 × 1 cm fatty mass wedged into the interdomal space continuing between the middle and medial cruses of the alar cartilages, which were laterally dislocated. The mass was excised by sharp and blunt dissection, and histopathologic examination resulted in a diagnosis of myolipoma. This report presents a novel location of myolipoma discovered incidentally. Its unexpected presence affected the surgeons in their operational decisions and forced them to make a rapid change in their surgical plan.This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.
