{"id":64493,"title":"Genetic basis of rheumatoid arthritis: a current review.","abstract":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases. As with other complex traits, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have tremendously enhanced our understanding of the complex etiology of RA. In this review, we describe the genetic architecture of RA as determined through GWASs and meta-analyses. In addition, we discuss the pathologic mechanism of the disease by examining the combined findings of genetic and functional studies of individual RA-associated genes, including HLA-DRB1, PADI4, PTPN22, TNFAIP3, STAT4, and CCR6. Moreover, we briefly examine the potential use of genetic data in clinical practice in RA treatment, which represents a challenge in medical genetics in the post-GWAS era.
