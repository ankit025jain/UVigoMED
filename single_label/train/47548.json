{"id":47548,"title":"Association between hepatitis E and neurological disorders: two case studies and literature review.","abstract":"Hepatitis E (HEV) is an emerging disease in our developed countries, but is not routinely tested for in case of liver cytolysis. However, a growing number of extra-hepatic manifestations of HEV infection associated with acute hepatitis are reported. In this article, we discuss two cases of HEV with neurological symptoms, one with encephalitis, and the other with Parsonage Turner syndrome. All these disorders appeared concomitantly with liver cytolysis and disappeared quickly, following the viral kinetics. Only twenty cases of neurological manifestation of HEV have been described before. The use of HEV serology in patients with concurrent liver cytolysis and neurological symptoms has to be improved.
