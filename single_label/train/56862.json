{"id":56862,"title":"Subcutaneous and periorbital emphysema following dental procedure.","abstract":"Subcutaneous emphysema following a dental procedure is a relatively uncommon phenomenon that may produce a dramatic clinical presentation. The advent of high-powered dental equipment that uses directed and highly pressurized air has increased the risk of this complication, but few cases have been described in the ophthalmic literature. The authors present a case of subcutaneous periorbital emphysema in a young woman following a dental procedure. Aside from a temporary ptosis, there were no other ophthalmic complications. An attempt to decompress the air produced minimal relief. The condition resolved spontaneously within 1 week.
