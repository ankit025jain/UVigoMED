{"id":43834,"title":"PET-CT changes the management and improves outcome in patients with recurrent colorectal cancer.","abstract":"The present study aims to analyze the impact of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) on management change in patients with suspected or proven colorectal cancer recurrence, and to assess the effect of this management change on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).We retrospectively evaluated 122 patients with suspected potentially resectable recurrent colorectal cancer who underwent PET/CT scan. We determined management plans for these patients before and after the PET/CT examination.While previous conventional imaging studies had revealed solitary metastases, additional sites of disease were determined by PET/CT scan in 52/122 (42%) patients. PET/CT examination results changed the treatment plan to curative intent in 35 (37%) patients. While the median PFS was 22 months (95% CI, 11.2-32.6 months) among the patients planned to receive curative treatment after the PET/CT scan, it was 11 months (95% CI, 8.1-13.9 months) in patients planned to receive curative treatment before the PET/CT examination, and the difference between median PFS durations was statistically significant (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.32 - 0.88], P = 0.004). Furthermore, OS was significantly longer in patients planned to receive curative treatment after the PET/CT scan (27 months [95% CI, 22.1-31.9]) compared with those who received curative treatment before the PET/CT scan (21 months [95% CI, 15.6 - 26.4]), and the difference was statistically significant (HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.42 - 0.89], P = 0.045).The present study demonstrates the significant impact of PET/CT on the management and outcome in patients with recurrent colorectal cancer.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762498","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.68779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.494868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.408251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.403867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.376251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.35085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.345331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.135988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.102966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.056272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Home run","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Greenhouse gas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas"}]}
