{"id":82255,"title":"Fabrication of a hollow bulb prosthesis for the rehabilitation of an acquired total maxillectomy defect.","abstract":"The prosthodontic rehabilitation of maxillary defects is a challenging and demanding task which requires careful pre-surgical and post-surgical planning. Maxillary defects can be congenital or acquired. Acquired defects include those following trauma or surgical treatment of benign or malignant neoplasms. A prosthodontist encounters problems such as absence of support, poor retention, and lack of prosthesis stability in treating these patients. The present case report describes a procedure to fabricate a definitive hollow bulb obturator prosthesis for the rehabilitation of a total maxillectomy defect.
