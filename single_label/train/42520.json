{"id":42520,"title":"High hepatitis B and low hepatitis C prevalence in Roma population in eastern Slovakia.","abstract":"Viral hepatitis B and C prevalence in the Roma population of eastern Slovakia is largely unknown. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and associated risk factors of chronic viral hepatitis B and C among Roma living in segregated communities in eastern Slovakia.Data from the cross-sectional HepaMeta study conducted in Slovakia in 2011 among Roma living in rural communities were used. Participants were tested for the presence of HBsAg, anti-HBc IgG and anti-HCV. The risk factors were assessed mainly via a structured questionnaire/interview.Altogether 452 Roma were screened, and 11 were excluded due to missing data. A total of 441 patients were included (mean age 34.7 +/- 9.14 years; 35.2% men). 12.5% of participants were HBsAg positive, 40.4% anti-HBc IgG positive while negative for HBsAg and 47.2% of participants were negative for all serological markers of hepatitis B. Hepatitis C prevalence was very low (0.7%), while 2 out of 3 anti-HCV positive participants were coinfected with hepatitis B. Risk factors for hepatitis B infection were male sex, higher age, tattoo, and previous imprisonment. No difference was found in intravenous drug use, blood transfusions and sexual behaviour.More than half of the Roma residing in eastern Slovakia have been infected at one point in life with the hepatitis B virus, and 12.5% are HBsAg positive. Hepatitis C prevalence is very low, which is probably due to very low intravenous drug use.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847615","annotations":[{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.789102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Tattoo","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.461139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.370212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.222557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Slovakia","weight":0.127428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Incarceration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration"},{"name":"Rome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Racial segregation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
