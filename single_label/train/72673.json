{"id":72673,"title":"Mass spectrometric analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein-protein interactions (PPIs).","abstract":"Of the 25,000-30,000 human genes, about 2 % code for proteins. However, there are about one to two million protein entities. This is primarily due to alternative splicing and post-translational modifications (PTMs). Identifying all these modifications in one proteome at a particular time point during development or during the transition from normal to cancerous cells is a great challenge to scientists. In addition, identifying the biological significance of all these modifications, as well as their nature, such as stable versus transient modifications, is an even more challenging. Furthermore, interaction of proteins and protein isoforms that have one or more stable or transient PTMs with other proteins and protein isoforms makes the study of proteins daunting and complex. Here we review some of the strategies to study proteins, protein isoforms, protein PTMs, and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Our goal is to provide a thorough understanding of these proteins and their isoforms, PTMs and PPIs and to shed light on the biological significance of these factors.
