{"id":4534,"title":"Association analyses of oxidative stress, aerobic capacity, daily physical activity, and body composition parameters in patients with mild to moderate COPD.","abstract":"To investigate total oxidant and antioxidant status, maximal aerobic capacity, daily physical activity, pulmonary functions, and body composition changes, as well as the associations among these parameters, in patients with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) versus healthy controls.The study included 30 male patients newly diagnosed with COPD and 30 body mass index-matched, nonsmoker male controls. Maximal aerobic capacity, daily physical activity, total oxidant and antioxidant status, pulmonary function tests, body composition, and anthropometric parameters were measured.Maximal aerobic capacity and total antioxidant values were lower in patients with COPD compared to the controls. The total oxidant value, body fat percentage, and waist/hip ratio were higher in patients with COPD than in the healthy controls. There was a moderately negative correlation between the total oxidant value and the maximal aerobic capacity, while there was a moderately positive correlation between the total antioxidant values and maximal aerobic capacity in patients with COPD.Low aerobic capacity, increased oxidative stress, and adiposity are related to impaired pulmonary functions in patients with mild to moderate COPD and might have a role in the pathogenesis of COPD.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552149","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Body fat percentage","weight":0.768876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.694954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.504881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.479283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.451168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.216731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"Aerobic exercise","weight":0.0698947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"VO2 max","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Oxidizing agent","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidizing_agent"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
