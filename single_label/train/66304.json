{"id":66304,"title":"The epidemiology and clinical implications of genetic variation in prostate cancer.","abstract":"There is strong evidence of a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer. Recent advances in genetic sequencing technologies have permitted significant advances in the field. This article reviews the genetic basis underlying prostate cancer, and highlights the epidemiology and potential clinical usefulness of both rare and common genetic variations. In addition, recent findings related to the understanding of prostate cancer genetics are discussed.
