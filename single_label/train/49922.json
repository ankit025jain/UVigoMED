{"id":49922,"title":"PET/CT in the management of thyroid cancers.","abstract":"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer. This review evaluates the established use of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in papillary, follicular, HÃ¼rthle cell, anaplastic, and medullary thyroid cancers. The significance of incidental diffuse and focal thyroid FDG uptake is discussed. The evolving value of non-FDG radiotracers, including (124)I, (18)F-dihydroxyphenylalanine, and (68)Ga somatostatin analogs, is summarized.PET/CT is a valuable imaging test, in the appropriate clinical context, for the management of thyroid cancers.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848831","annotations":[{"name":"Somatostatin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.849187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.613936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.487247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.299321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Anaplasia","weight":0.254754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplasia"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.166542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Endocrine disease","weight":0.118638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_disease"},{"name":"Medullary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0599958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Gallium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
