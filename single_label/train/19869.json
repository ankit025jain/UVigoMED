{"id":19869,"title":"A screening strategy for phenotypic detection of carbapenemase in the clinical laboratory.","abstract":"Nosocomial infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae have emerged as an important challenge worldwide and represent a great limitation for antimicrobial therapy. Detection of carbapenemase in Enterobacteriaceae species also remains challenging. Although the modified Hodge test is recommended, it lacks specificity and is unable to distinguish between carbapenemase types. Here, we demonstrated a screening strategy for the phenotypic detection of carbapenemases among Enterobacteriaceae isolates in the clinical laboratory by using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and phenylboronic acid. This strategy displayed an overall 100% sensitivity and 98.6% specificity for carbapenemase detection in Enterobacteriaceae, which was superior to that of the modified Hodge test (98.0% sensitivity and 84.3% specificity), and it also discriminated the carbapenemase phenotypes of KPC-2, VIM-1, and OXA-48.
