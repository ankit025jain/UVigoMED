{"id":46153,"title":"[Immunological parameters on prophase of severe hepatitis B].","abstract":"To study cellular and humoral immune status on prophase of severe hepatitis B (PSHB).56 cases of PSHB patients, 40 cases of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 20 cases of healthy volunteers were enrolled for detection of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD3-/CD19+ (B cells) lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood by flow cytometry. Serum IgG and complement C3 was detected by immunoturbidimetry and analyzed statistically.Compared with CHB group and healthy control group, percentage of lymphocyte subsets CD8+ were significantly lower in PSHB group (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). While the percentage of lymphocyte subsets CD4+ and ratio of CD4+/CD8+ in PSHB group was obviously higher than those in CHB group (P < 0.+01 or P < 0.05). In addition, There was no significant difference on the percentage of B cell and level of serum IgG between PSHB group and CHB group (P > 0.05, while the level of serum complement C3 in PSHB group were significantly lower than those in CHB group and healthy control group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05).PSHB has a certain degree of cellular immune dysfunction, which characterized by cellular immune function hyperfunction and humoral immune suppression.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24645326","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.887796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"CD19","weight":0.804518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD19"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.756922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.691812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Complement component 3","weight":0.443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_component_3"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.398498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"Prophase","weight":0.357443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophase"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.333977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.281358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.233977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"}]}
