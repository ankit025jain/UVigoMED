{"id":14633,"title":"The phylogenetic study on Thelohanellus species (Myxosporea) in relation to host specificity and infection site tropism.","abstract":"Thelohanellus kitauei (Myxobolidae) infects cyprinid fish. The evolution of species derived from common ancestors results in the sharing of biological features. To reveal the origin of T. kitauei biological features, the correlation between phylogeny and biological features of Myxobolidae was investigated by Bayesian inference tree and Bayesian tip association significance testing. The results demonstrated that host specificity and infection site tropism were correlated with the phylogeny of Myxobolidae, and that the biological features of T. kitauei originated from the ancient Myxobolidae as exhibited by the non-specific infection site tropism and the ability to infect cyprinids.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412432","annotations":[{"name":"Bayesian inference","weight":0.911331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Inference","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.713397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.630035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.18735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Common descent","weight":0.15322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_descent"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Ancient history","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history"},{"name":"Cyprinidae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprinidae"},{"name":"Tropism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropism"},{"name":"Myxosporea","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxosporea"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Evolutionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionism"}]}
