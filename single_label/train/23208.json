{"id":23208,"title":"Clinical implications for patients treated inappropriately for community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department.","abstract":"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infections presenting to the emergency department (ED). Increasingly, antibiotic resistant bacteria have been identified as causative pathogens in patients treated for CAP, especially in patients with healthcare exposure risk factors.We retrospectively identified adult subjects treated for CAP in the ED requiring hospital admission (January 2003-December 2011). Inappropriate antibiotic treatment, defined as an antibiotic regimen that lacked in vitro activity against the isolated pathogen, served as the primary end point. Information regarding demographics, severity of illness, comorbidities, and antibiotic treatment was recorded. Logistic regression was used to determine factors independently associated with inappropriate treatment.The initial cohort included 259 patients, 72 (27.8%) receiving inappropriate antibiotic treatment. There was no difference in hospital mortality between patients receiving inappropriate and appropriate treatment (8.3% vs. 7.0%; p = 0.702). Hospital length of stay (10.3 ± 12.0 days vs. 7.0 ± 8.9 days; p = 0.017) and 30-day readmission (23.6% vs. 12.3%; p = 0.024) were greater among patients receiving inappropriate treatment. Three variables were independently associated with inappropriate treatment: admission from long-term care (AOR, 9.05; 95% CI, 3.93-20.84), antibiotic exposure in the previous 30 days (AOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.35-2.52), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AOR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.52-2.78).Inappropriate antibiotic treatment of presumed CAP in the ED negatively impacts patient outcome and readmission rate. Knowledge of risk factors associated with inappropriate antibiotic treatment of presumed CAP could advance the management of patients with pneumonia presenting to the ED and potentially improve patient outcomes.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499035","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.770054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.706572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.615767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.405455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.385378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0337886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Admission note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_note"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Morality","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
