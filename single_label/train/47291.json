{"id":47291,"title":"Characteristics of focal liver lesions in arterial phase on contrast-enhanced ultrasound and contrast--enhanced computed tomography - comparative study.","abstract":"To compare the features of focal liver lesions in the arterial phase on contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT).A total of 38 lesions in 29 patients with focal liver lesions (FLL) were examined with CEUS and CECT. The characteristics of the enhancement were determined, especially in the early arterial phase (0~25 s). The enhancement of FLL in CEUS and CECT graded as follows: grade 0 - no enhancement; grade I - peripheral enhancement or spotty enhancement at the center; grade II - spoke-like, honeycomb-like or heterogeneous enhancement; grade II - entire enhancement.On CEUS, the arriving time within 25 s was found in 36 out of 38 lesions (94.73%) and the peak time within 25 s in 29 lesions (76.32%). The number of grade II-III FLL was 25 (65.79%) on CEUS, and 13 (34.21%) on CECT showing a significant difference (p < 0.05).Compared with CECT, CEUS plays an important role in the diagnosis of FLL with enhancement in the early arterial phase (< 25 s).","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24596008","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.807742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.594376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.449993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.309391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.251242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.153777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Prime time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"FIRST Lego League","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Lego_League"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Buzz cut","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_cut"}]}
