{"id":12164,"title":"Strategies and hurdles using DNA vaccines to fish.","abstract":"DNA vaccinations against fish viral diseases as IHNV at commercial level in Canada against VHSV at experimental level are both success stories. DNA vaccination strategies against many other viral diseases have, however, not yet yielded sufficient results in terms of protection. There is an obvious need to combat many other viral diseases within aquaculture where inactivated vaccines fail. There are many explanations to why DNA vaccine strategies against other viral diseases fail to induce protective immune responses in fish. These obstacles include: 1) too low immunogenicity of the transgene, 2) too low expression of the transgene that is supposed to induce protection, 3) suboptimal immune responses, and 4) too high degradation rate of the delivered plasmid DNA. There are also uncertainties with regard distribution and degradation of DNA vaccines that may have implications for safety and regulatory requirements that need to be clarified. By combining plasmid DNA with different kind of adjuvants one can increase the immunogenicity of the transgene antigen - and perhaps increase the vaccine efficacy. By using molecular adjuvants with or without in combination with targeting assemblies one may expect different responses compared with naked DNA. This includes targeting of DNA vaccines to antigen presenting cells as a central factor in improving their potencies and efficacies by means of encapsulating the DNA vaccine in certain carriers systems that may increase transgene and MHC expression. This review will focus on DNA vaccine delivery, by the use of biodegradable PLGA particles as vehicles for plasmid DNA mainly in fish.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552235","annotations":[{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.809629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.770054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"DNA vaccination","weight":0.73452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_vaccination"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Aquaculture","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture"},{"name":"Transgene","weight":0.651036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgene"},{"name":"Antigen-presenting cell","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen-presenting_cell"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Biodegradation","weight":0.529137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation"},{"name":"Naked DNA","weight":0.494356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_DNA"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.388002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.375381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.225021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Commercial fishing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_fishing"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Nudity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity"},{"name":"Combat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
