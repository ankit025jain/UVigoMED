{"id":51938,"title":"Real-world patient-reported rates of non-severe hypoglycaemic events in Germany.","abstract":"Hypoglycaemia is a common side effect of insulin therapy in diabetes patients, with negative physical and emotional impacts. Despite this, there are few studies investigating the frequency of non-severe hypoglycaemic events from the perspective of patients in the real-world setting. We investigated self-reported NSHE frequency and levels of hypoglycaemia awareness in Germany.Respondents > 15 years with Type 1 or insulin-treated Type 2 diabetes (receiving basal only, basal-bolus or other insulin regimens) were recruited using online panels to complete ? 4 questionnaires. Questionnaires collected demographics, non-severe hypoglycaemic event rates and patient-reported level of hypoglycaemia awareness. Non-severe hypoglycaemic event rates are reported as respondent-week records and calculated using data from all respondents completing at least one questionnaire.A total of 1,771 respondent-week records were obtained from 614 participants. Mean non-severe hypoglycaemic event rates per respondent-week were 1.6 for Type 1 and 0.6-0.8 for Type 2, with estimated annual rates of 83 and 31-42 respectively. Two-thirds of Type 1 (65%) and Type 2 (61-72%) respondents reported impaired levels of awareness or unawareness of hypoglycaemic events (inability or impaired ability to recognise the symptoms of hypoglycaemia). ResponÂ­dents' self-reported hypoglycaemia-awareness was significantly associated with the proportion of asymptomatic non-severe hypoglycaemic events; respondents classified as being unaware of hypoglycaemia had a higher proportion of asymptomatic non-severe hypoglycaemic events than aware respondents.Non-severe hypoglycaemic events are common in people with Type 1 or insulin-treated Type 2 diabetes in the real-world setting in Germany but may still be underestimated due to an inability to recognise the symptoms of hypoglycaemia.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24643694","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.9371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.722341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.621852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.597982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.318828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.236252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.183204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.143806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Self-awareness","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"771","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/771"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Minuscule 614","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_614"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Insulin therapy","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_therapy"}]}
