{"id":25893,"title":"[Early morning hypertension/morning blood pressure surge].","abstract":"Early morning hypertension and morning blood pressure surge have been reported to be associated with organ damage and cardiovascular events. The concept of early morning hypertension and morning blood pressure surge is sometimes discussed in the same arena, and provides partly overlapping information concerning their mechanism or risk profile. However, what is different between groups is as follows. First, early morning hypertension is blood pressure level, while morning blood pressure surge is variability of blood pressure. Second, the intervention of early morning hypertension is available, which lead to prevent the progression of organ damage or cardiovascular event, but there is not enough evidence whether the reduction of morning blood pressure surge would reduce cardiovascular outcome.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167741","annotations":[{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.509076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.504859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.478737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.460335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.445358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.432167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.194708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0344035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0171701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Arena","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Mechanism (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(engineering)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Geopotential height","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopotential_height"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"}]}
