{"id":89664,"title":"Classification of orbital fractures using the AO/ASIF system in a population surveillance cohort of traumatic optic neuropathy.","abstract":"In our prospective nationwide surveillance study of traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) in the United Kingdom, the prevalence of orbital fractures was found to be 39% (47/121). The prevalence of skull fractures was 7.4% (9/121). This study aims to identify the association of craniofacial-orbital fractures with the severity of visual loss.TON patients who sustained orbital fractures were identified prospectively by population-based active surveillance through the British Ophthalmic Surveillance Unit over a 2-year period. Available CT scans were classified by a head and neck radiologist according to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Osteosynthesefragen/Association for the Study of Internal Fixation (AO/ASIF) scheme: the face was divided into 4 units; fractures in each unit were graded according to displacement (A-C) and severity (1.1-3.3). Correlation between severity of craniofacial orbital fractures and visual acuity as well as number of fractured units and visual acuity were evaluated.Twelve of the 25 patients (48%) with imaging available had adequate high resolution craniofacial CT imaging for review and classification using the AO/ASIF system (i.e. 48 classifiable units). Three of 48 (6%) units were undisplaced (grade A), 18 of 48 (29%) units were minimally displaced (grade B), and 4 of 48 (8%) units had largely displaced (grade C) fractures. Twenty-three units (47.9%) had no fractures; 5 patients had radiological evidence of optic canal fractures. Poor visual acuities positively correlated with severity of fractures graded using the AO/ASIF classification (Spearman's rho?=?0.95, p?=?0.05) and number of fractured units (Spearman's rho?=?1.0, p?<?0.0001).AO/ASIF classification system provides a uniform method in the assessment of orbital fractures which correlates with visual outcome in TON.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Wounds and
