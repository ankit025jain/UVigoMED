{"id":18395,"title":"[Mid-term results of total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis secondary to hip sepsis].","abstract":"To evaluate mid-term results of total hip arthroplasty (THA) for treatment of osteoarthritis secondary to hip sepsis.Between February 2003 and January 2009, 62 patients (62 hips) with osteoarthritis secondary to hip sepsis underwent THA. There were 32 males and 30 females with an average age of 39.9 years (range, 18-67 years). The original infection included pyogenic arthritis in 40 hips and tuberculosis in 22 hips. After infection, 35 patients underwent nonoperative treatment, and 27 patients received operative management. The average time interval between initial infection and THA was 28.7 years (range, 12-53 years). The preoperative Harris hip score was 24.6 +/- 9.2. The Trendelenburg sign was positive in all hips. Leg discrepancy was observed in 25 cases, and the mean discrepancy of bilateral lower extremities was 3.8 cm (range, 2.6-6.5 cm) preoperatively. All hips had no evidence of active hip sepsis.All patients were followed up 72 months on average (range, 54-115 months). Intraoperative complications included sciatic nerve injury (2 cases) and femoral shaft fractures (2 cases); postoperative complications included hip anterior dislocation (1 case) and periprosthetic infection (1 case). At last follow-up, 1 hip, 5 hips, 18 hips, and 38 hips were found to have severe pain, moderate pain, slight pain, and no pain respectively. Claudication occurred in 30 patients (mild in 19, moderate in 8, and severe in 3). The Trendelenburg sign was positive in 18 hips. After THA, only 5 patients had a leg length discrepancy of 2.9 cm on average (range, 2.6-3.5 cm). The Harris score was significantly increased to 82.3 +/- 11.4 at last follow-up when compared with preoperative one (t = -31.241, P=0.000). The results of subjective satisfaction were very satisfactory in 43 cases, satisfactory in 12 cases, unsatisfactory in 4 cases, and unsatisfactory at all in 3 cases. No sign of aseptic loosening of prosthesis was found during follow-up period. Roentgenographic results showed no radiolucent line or osteolysis in the other patients except 2 patients having local radiolucent. After THA, 12 hips had heterotopic ossification.The mid-term clinical and radiographic results of THA for treatment of osteoarthritis secondary to hip sepsis are good, with the advantages of high satisfactory rate, good function recovery, and low complication incidence.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796197","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.890882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.822567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.804236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.769557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.67311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Osteolysis","weight":0.640718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolysis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.635814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.579102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.523766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.510706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.490704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.475778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Sciatic nerve","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatic_nerve"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.369595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.131926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.125424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Claudication","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudication"},{"name":"Pyogenic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyogenic"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"}]}
