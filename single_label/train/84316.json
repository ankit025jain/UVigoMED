{"id":84316,"title":"NuA4 initiates dynamic histone H4 acetylation to promote high-fidelity sister chromatid recombination at postreplication gaps.","abstract":"CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats are unstable, fragile sequences that strongly position nucleosomes, but little is known about chromatin modifications required to prevent genomic instability at these or other structure-forming sequences. We discovered that regulated histone H4 acetylation is required to maintain CAG repeat stability and promote gap-induced sister chromatid recombination. CAG expansions in the absence of H4 HATs NuA4 and Hat1 and HDACs Sir2, Hos2, and Hst1 depended on Rad52, Rad57, and Rad5 and were therefore arising through homology-mediated postreplication repair (PRR) events. H4K12 and H4K16 acetylation were required to prevent Rad5-dependent CAG repeat expansions, and H4K16 acetylation was enriched at CAG repeats during S phase. Genetic experiments placed the RSC chromatin remodeler in the same PRR pathway, and Rsc2 recruitment was coincident with H4K16 acetylation. Here we have utilized a repetitive DNA sequence that induces endogenous DNA damage to identify histone modifications that regulate recombination efficiency and fidelity during postreplication gap repair.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25132173","annotations":[{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.922535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Chromatin","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin"},{"name":"Chromatid","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatid"},{"name":"S phase","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_phase"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Repeated sequence (DNA)","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_sequence_(DNA)"},{"name":"Acetylation","weight":0.787188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylation"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Nucleosome","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosome"},{"name":"Sister chromatids","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_chromatids"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.72338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Chromatin remodeling","weight":0.636582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin_remodeling"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.56214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.500223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"Sir2","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir2"},{"name":"RAD52","weight":0.376702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD52"},{"name":"Trinucleotide repeat disorder","weight":0.299542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinucleotide_repeat_disorder"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.150375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Histone H4","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_H4"},{"name":"Design of experiments","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments"},{"name":"Chromatin Structure Remodeling (RSC) Complex","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin_Structure_Remodeling_(RSC)_Complex"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"F1 hybrid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_hybrid"}]}
