{"id":30899,"title":"Prevalence and correlates of alcohol and cannabis use disorders in the United States: results from the national longitudinal study of adolescent health.","abstract":"Limited current information on the epidemiology of lifetime alcohol and cannabis use disorders in the United States is available.To present detailed information about the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of lifetime alcohol and cannabis use disorders rates in the United States. To examine gender differences in hazard ratios for the onset of alcohol and cannabis dependence.Participants in Wave IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=15,500, age range: 24-32) were interviewed between 2008 and 2009. Participants who exceeded screening thresholds were queried about lifetime DSM-IV alcohol and marijuana abuse and dependence symptoms. Age of substance dependence onset was queried.Lifetime rates of alcohol abuse and dependence were 11.8 and 13.2%. Lifetime rates of cannabis abuse and dependence were 3.9 and 8.3%. Lifetime alcohol and cannabis dependence onset peaks were 23 and 20. Correlates of lifetime alcohol abuse included being male (OR 1.4), African-American (OR 0.7), income in the 2nd or 3rd quartile (OR 0.7 and 0.6). Correlates of lifetime alcohol dependence were: being male (OR 1.8), African-American (OR 0.5), and never being married (OR 1.5), and regions outside of the west (Midwest OR 0.7, South OR 0.6, Northeast OR 0.6). Correlates of cannabis abuse and dependence were being male (OR 1.8 and 1.4).Lifetime alcohol and cannabis use disorders are highly prevalent in the US population. Men are at higher risk for alcohol and cannabis use disorders. Alcohol use disorders demonstrated specific sociodemographic correlates while marijuana use disorders did not.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced
