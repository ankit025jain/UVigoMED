{"id":88873,"title":"Does use of a powered ankle-foot prosthesis restore whole-body angular momentum during walking at different speeds?","abstract":"Whole-body angular momentum (H) influences fall risk, is tightly regulated during walking, and is primarily controlled by muscle force generation. People with transtibial amputations using passive-elastic prostheses typically have greater H compared with nonamputees.(1) Do people with unilateral transtibial amputations using passive-elastic prostheses have greater sagittal and frontal plane H ranges of motion during walking compared with nonamputees and compared with using powered prostheses? (2) Does use of powered ankle-foot prostheses result in equivalent H ranges in all planes of motion compared with nonamputees during walking as a result of normative prosthetic ankle power generation?Eight patients with a unilateral transtibial amputation and eight nonamputees walked 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, and 1.75 m/s while we measured kinematics and ground reaction forces. We calculated H for participants using their passive-elastic prosthesis and a powered ankle-foot prosthesis and for nonamputees at each speed.Patients using passive-elastic prostheses had 32% to 59% greater sagittal H ranges during the affected leg stance phase compared with nonamputees at 1.00 to 1.75 m/s (p < 0.05). Patients using passive-elastic prostheses had 5% and 9% greater sagittal H ranges compared with using powered prostheses at 1.25 and 1.50 m/s, respectively (p < 0.05). Participants using passive-elastic prostheses had 29% and 17% greater frontal H ranges at 0.75 and 1.50 m/s, respectively, compared with nonamputees (p < 0.05). Surprisingly, patients using powered prostheses had 26% to 50% greater sagittal H ranges during the affected leg stance phase compared with nonamputees at 1.00 to 1.75 m/s (p < 0.05). Patients using powered prostheses also had 26% greater frontal H range compared with nonamputees at 0.75 m/s (p < 0.05).People with a transtibial amputation may more effectively regulate H at two specific walking speeds when using powered compared with passive-elastic prostheses.Our results support the hypothesis that an ankle-foot prosthesis capable of providing net positive work during the stance phase of walking reduces sagittal plane H; future studies are needed to validate our biomechanical findings with larger numbers of patients and should determine whether powered prostheses can decrease the risk of falls in patients with a transtibial amputation.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781926","annotations":[{"name":"Force","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Momentum","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum"},{"name":"Kinematics","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.742497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.405878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.386252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.369388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.363706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Angular momentum","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.234883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.179267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Fixed-wing aircraft","weight":0.170357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Reaction (physics)","weight":0.0584998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_(physics)"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Electricity generation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Frontal bone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_bone"},{"name":"People (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Coronal plane","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_plane"}]}
