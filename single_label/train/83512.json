{"id":83512,"title":"Direct antiglobulin titer strength and hyperbilirubinemia.","abstract":"We recently demonstrated that direct antiglobulin titer (DAT) positive, blood group A or B newborns born to group O mothers had a high incidence of hyperbilirubinemia, attributable to increased hemolysis. We reanalyzed our data asking whether increasing DAT strength plays a modulating role in the pathophysiology of the hemolysis and hyperbilirubinemia.Data from previously published DAT-positive, ABO-heterospecific neonates were analyzed for hyperbilirubinemia and hemolysis according to strength of DAT. DAT was measured by using a gel agglutination technique and reported as values ranging from DAT ± to DAT ++++. Hemolysis was evaluated by blood carboxyhemoglobin corrected for inspired, ambient CO (COHbc), and expressed as percent total hemoglobin (tHb). Hyperbilirubinemia was defined as any plasma total bilirubin value >95th percentile on the hour-specific nomogram.Hyperbilirubinemia was more prevalent in those with DAT ++ readings (16 of 20, 80%) than those both DAT ± (37 of 87 [42.5%], relative risk: 1.88, 95% confidence interval: 1.35-2.61) and DAT + (32 of 56 [57.1%], relative risk: 1.40, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.92). COHbc values were higher for those with DAT ++ (1.45 ± 0.49% tHb [mean ± SD]) than those DAT ± (1.20 ± 0.37% tHb, P = .01) or DAT + (1.22 ± 0.37% tHb, P = .02).DAT ++ readings were associated with a higher incidence of hyperbilirubinemia and higher COHbc values than DAT ± or DAT + counterparts. Increasing DAT strength may be a modulator of hemolysis and hyperbilirubinemia in ABO-heterospecific neonates. DAT strength, and not merely DAT presence or absence, should be taken into consideration in the management of ABO-heterospecific newborns.","date":"2014-11-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25332496","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.795801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.670092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.624093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.475824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.411798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Carboxyhemoglobin","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxyhemoglobin"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Blood type","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Digital Audio Tape","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Tape"},{"name":"Nomogram","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram"},{"name":"Agglutination (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutination_(biology)"},{"name":"Hyperbilirubinemia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbilirubinemia"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"List of The Muppet Show episodes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Muppet_Show_episodes"},{"name":"Ambient music","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
