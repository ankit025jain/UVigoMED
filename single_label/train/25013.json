{"id":25013,"title":"Cardiac dysfunction in ?-carotene-15,15'-dioxygenase-deficient mice is associated with altered retinoid and lipid metabolism.","abstract":"Dietary carotenoids like ?-carotene are converted within the body either to retinoid, via ?-carotene-15,15'-dioxygenase (BCO1), or to ?-apo-carotenoids, via ?-carotene-9',10'-oxygenase 2. Some ?-apo-carotenoids are potent antagonists of retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-mediated transcriptional regulation, which is required to ensure normal heart development and functions. We established liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometery methods for measuring concentrations of 10 ?-apo-carotenoids in mouse plasma, liver, and heart and assessed how these are influenced by Bco1 deficiency and ?-carotene intake. Surprisingly, Bco1(-/-) mice had an increase in heart levels of retinol, nonesterified fatty acids, and ceramides and a decrease in heart triglycerides. These lipid changes were accompanied by elevations in levels of genes important to retinoid metabolism, specifically retinol dehydrogenase 10 and retinol-binding protein 4, as well as genes involved in lipid metabolism, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-?, lipoprotein lipase, Cd36, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, and fatty acid synthase. We also obtained evidence of compromised heart function, as assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography, in Bco1(-/-) mice. However, the total absence of Bco1 did not substantially affect ?-apo-carotenoid concentrations in the heart. ?-Carotene administration to matched Bco1(-/-) and wild-type mice elevated total ?-apo-carotenal levels in the heart, liver, and plasma and total ?-apo-carotenoic acid levels in the liver. Thus, BCO1 modulates heart metabolism and function, possibly by altering levels of cofactors required for the actions of nuclear hormone receptors.
