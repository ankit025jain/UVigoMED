{"id":62536,"title":"Review of current surgical treatments for lymphedema.","abstract":"The current mainstay of lymphedema therapy has been conservative nonsurgical treatment. However, surgical options for lymphedema have been reported for over a century. Early surgical procedures were often invasive and disfiguring, and they often had only limited long-term success. In contrast, contemporary surgical techniques are much less invasive and have been shown to be effective in reducing excess limb volume, the risk of cellulitis, and the need for compression garment use and lymphedema therapy. Microsurgical procedures such as lymphaticovenous anastomosis and vascularized lymph node transfer lymphaticolymphatic bypass can treat the excess fluid component of lymphedema swelling that presents as pitting edema. Suction-assisted protein lipectomy is a minimally invasive procedure that addresses the solid component of lymphedema swelling that typically occurs later in the disease process and presents as chronic nonpitting lymphedema. These surgical techniques are becoming increasingly popular and their success continues to be documented in the medical literature. We review the efficacy and limitations of these contemporary surgical procedures for lymphedema.A Medline literature review was performed of lymphedema surgery, vascularized lymph node transfer, lymphaticovenous anastomosis, lymphatic liposuction, and lymphaticolymphatic bypass with particular emphasis on developments within the past 10 years. A literature review of technique, indications, and outcomes of the surgical treatments for lymphedema was undertaken.Surgical treatments have evolved to become less invasive and more effective.With proper diagnosis and the appropriate selection of procedure, surgical techniques can be used to treat lymphedema safely and effectively in many patients when combined with integrated lymphedema therapy.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558061","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cellulitis","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulitis"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Lymphedema","weight":0.797146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.739713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.658874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.634756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Liposuction","weight":0.619196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposuction"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.532099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.343766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Clothing","weight":0.135596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Medical literature","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_literature"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Hypervolemia","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervolemia"},{"name":"Disfigurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfigurement"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
