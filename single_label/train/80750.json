{"id":80750,"title":"Clinical management of neurocysticercosis.","abstract":"Neurocysticercosis is the most common helminthic disease of the nervous system and a leading cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. Differences in the number and location of lesions as well as in the severity of the immune response against the parasites, makes neurocysticercosis a complex disease. Therefore, a single therapeutic approach is not expected to be useful in every patient. Introduction of cysticidal drugs - praziquantel and albendazole - have changed the prognosis of thousands of patients with neurocysticercosis. While pioneer trials of therapy were flawed by a poor design, recent studies have shown that cysticidal drugs results in disappearance of lesions and clinical improvement in most cases. Nevertheless, some patients with parenchymal neurocysticercosis may be left with remaining cysts and may develop recurrent seizures after therapy, and many patients with subarachnoid cysts may need repeated courses of therapy. In addition, not all forms of the disease benefit from cysticidal drugs.
