{"id":67702,"title":"BCG-induced pneumonitis with lymphocytic pleurisy in the absence of elevated KL-6.","abstract":"Pneumonitis is a rare complication of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy seen in patients with urothelial cancer following the repeated administration of BCG. However, no case of BCG-induced pleurisy has been reported.We here report the first case of pneumonitis with lymphocytic pleurisy following bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy. Although marked T helper cell alveolitis was found by bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsies, no acid-fast bacillus could be identified in recovered BALF or pleural effusion. The lymphocyte stimulation test of BCG was strongly positive. However, levels of serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid KL-6, a useful marker for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), were within normal ranges.We speculate that the pathogenesis of our case may be a hypersensitive reaction to the proteic component of BCG entering the lung and pleural space, which is different from the etiology of the common type of HP.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24593234","annotations":[{"name":"Pleurisy","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurisy"},{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.863726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.754147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.74513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.728081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Pneumonitis","weight":0.4011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonitis"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity_pneumonitis"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.310879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Alveolitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolitis"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"ACTH stimulation test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTH_stimulation_test"}]}
