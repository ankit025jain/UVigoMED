{"id":81657,"title":"Effect of dentin conditioning on bond strength of fiber posts and dentin morphology: a review.","abstract":"Post and core systems are commonly used to restore endodontically treated teeth. A durable bond between fiber posts and dentin contributes to the success of the restorative treatment. Different irrigants are used during post space preparation and various studies have investigated the effects of these chemical agents on bond strength and dentin morphology.The MEDLINE-PubMed, Cochrane, and SCOPUS databases were searched for appropriate papers addressing the effects of irrigants on bonding of fiber posts to dentin and on dentin morphology. Databases were searched from 2002 through 2012. The search was performed using a variety of keywords including fiber posts, bond strength, post space preparation, post space irrigation, and smear layer removal.Using multiple key words and different strategies, 68 publications were initially screened. The abstracts of these 68 publications were scanned for relevance, and 50 full-text articles were selected and read in detail. Thirty publications which discussed the effect of various intracanal irrigants on bond strengths of fiber posts and dentin morphology were incorporated in this review. Following review of all relevant papers, it can be concluded that bond strengths of fiber posts to radicular dentin can be affected by the irrigants used and that various irrigants affect different types of resin cements differently.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902397","annotations":[{"name":"Resin","weight":0.352697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.23814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Scopus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Post and core","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_and_core"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Keywords","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keywords"},{"name":"Full text search","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_text_search"},{"name":"Radicular pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicular_pain"},{"name":"Keyword (linguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Dental cement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_cement"},{"name":"Endodontics","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontics"},{"name":"Endodontic therapy","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontic_therapy"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Scientific journal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Chemical weapon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapon"},{"name":"Bond strength","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_strength"}]}
