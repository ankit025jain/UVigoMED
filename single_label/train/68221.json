{"id":68221,"title":"Designing a web-application to support home-based care of childhood CKD stages 3-5: qualitative study of family and professional preferences.","abstract":"There is a lack of online, evidence-based information and resources to support home-based care of childhood CKD stages 3-5.Qualitative interviews were undertaken with parents, patients and professionals to explore their views on content of the proposed online parent information and support (OPIS) web-application. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis, guided by the concept of Self-efficacy.32 parents, 26 patients and 12 professionals were interviewed. All groups wanted an application that explains, demonstrates, and enables parental clinical care-giving, with condition-specific, continously available, reliable, accessible material and a closed communication system to enable contact between families living with CKD. Professionals advocated a regularly updated application to empower parents to make informed health-care decisions. To address these requirements, key web-application components were defined as: (i) Clinical care-giving support (information on treatment regimens, video-learning tools, condition-specific cartoons/puzzles, and a question and answer area) and (ii) Psychosocial support for care-giving (social-networking, case studies, managing stress, and enhancing families' health-care experiences).Developing a web-application that meets parents' information and support needs will maximise its utility, thereby augmenting parents' self-efficacy for CKD caregiving, and optimising outcomes. Self-efficacy theory provides a schema for how parents' self-efficacy beliefs about management of their child's CKD could potentially be promoted by OPIS.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548640","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.741915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.35922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.154042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.134399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Empowerment","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Knock-down kit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knock-down_kit"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0252209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Key (cryptography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)"},{"name":"Program optimization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Communications system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_system"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"}]}
