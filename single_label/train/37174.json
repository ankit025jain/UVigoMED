{"id":37174,"title":"Pitfalls in diagnosis: suspected anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery.","abstract":"Anomalous coronary arteries are rare in the general population. We report the case of a term neonate who underwent an echocardiogram to evaluate a possible patent ductus arteriosus. Unexpectedly, an apparent anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the main pulmonary artery was detected by surface 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography and color-flow Doppler imaging. Because ventricular size and function were normal, the patient ultimately underwent cardiac catheterization to verify the anatomy before proposed surgery. Angiograms showed that the right coronary artery arose from the left anterolateral portion of the mid-ascending aorta. The patient did not require surgery. This case report illustrates pitfalls that can occur in the diagnosis of coronary artery anomalies.
