{"id":89486,"title":"Removal of a giant nonmagnetic intraocular foreign body using micro alligator forceps.","abstract":"To introduce a new method for removal of a giant nonmagnetic intraocular foreign body using micro alligator forceps.Eleven patients underwent pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy. The micro alligator forceps were used to grasp and extract the giant nonmagnetic intraocular foreign body through a sclerocorneal tunnel.All patients underwent surgical removal of the intraocular foreign body successfully without any intraoperative complications. The alligator forceps were operational in the intraocular environment and effective in surgical maneuvers. There was no accidental slippage during the procedures.Micro alligator forceps are a feasible option for removal of giant nonmagnetic intraocular foreign body during vitreoretinal surgery and offer advances in terms of operating stability and surgical safety.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716803","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.121041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alligator","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Forceps","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forceps"},{"name":"Pars plana","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pars_plana"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Microwave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave"},{"name":"Landslide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide"},{"name":"Mechanical equilibrium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_equilibrium"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Plana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plana"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Microeconomics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microeconomics"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"}]}
