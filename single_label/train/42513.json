{"id":42513,"title":"[Congenital esophageal stenosis: a case report].","abstract":"Congenital esophageal stenosis, a rare disease of unknown cause which reports have increased in the last few years, requires a high index of suspicion for its diagnosis and treatment. It can be classified in three types based on the etiology of the stenosis: tracheobronchial rest, fibromuscular hypertrophy and membranous diaphragm. Symptoms may vary depending on location and severity of the stenosis. Treatment options are based on clinical suspicion of the histologic type and they can be balloon dilation or surgical resection of the stenotic segment. The definitive diagnosis is the histological study.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847632","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.662724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.633497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.582695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.575466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.554162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Tracheobronchial tree","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheobronchial_tree"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Filming location","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filming_location"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
