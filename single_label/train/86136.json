{"id":86136,"title":"An integrative review of screening for obstructive sleep apnea in commercial vehicle drivers.","abstract":"Obstructive sleep apnea has been a concern for commercial vehicle drivers for several decades. An increasing body of knowledge supports the idea that insufficient sleep can affect drivers' abilities to react efficiently and expediently, leading to motor vehicle accidents. Insufficient sleep can be described as short sleep periods, prolonged driving time, and dysfunctional sleep breathing. Commercial motor vehicle drivers are required to undergo physical examinations at least once every 2 years to maintain certification. Medical examiners are encouraged to screen for obstructive sleep apnea during these biannual examinations. Current literature identifies four frequently used screening tools for obstructive sleep apnea: STOP Questionnaire, STOP-Bang Questionnaire, Berlin Questionnaire, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Medical examiners must determine which screening method is valid, reliable, and has sufficient evidence to support its use.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24811697","annotations":[{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.301995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.290249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Motor vehicle","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.142977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.114525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.0412312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Epworth Sleepiness Scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epworth_Sleepiness_Scale"},{"name":"Berlin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin"},{"name":"Commercial vehicle","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_vehicle"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Professional certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_certification"},{"name":"Driving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving"},{"name":"Scale model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model"},{"name":"Stop sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_sign"},{"name":"Integrative psychotherapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrative_psychotherapy"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Biannual","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biannual"},{"name":"Advertising","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Body of Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_Knowledge"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"},{"name":"Breast cancer screening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_screening"},{"name":"Somnolence","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence"},{"name":"Epworth, Lincolnshire","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epworth,_Lincolnshire"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"}]}
