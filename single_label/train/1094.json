{"id":1094,"title":"Effect of aging on the vascular system plus monitoring and support.","abstract":"Cardiovascular diseases have become a major cause of morbidity and mortality and are likely to only increase as the geriatric population continues to grow. Much is already known about the basic risk factors associated with vascular aging, but there is a new direction of investigation into the health and viability of the endothelium at a biochemical level. As we continue to shift much of our health care focus into prevention tactics and techniques, slowing or reversing the aging process of the vascular system could have a profound impact on our aging population.
