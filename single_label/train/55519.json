{"id":55519,"title":"[Results of infrared diode laser application for iris reconstruction in cases of pupillary deformity and displacement in pseudophakic eyes].","abstract":"The article studies application possibilities and potency of near infrared coagulative radiation of a diode laser for correction of postoperative iris defects followed by pupillary deformities and displacement. It is found that the use of near infrared diode laser radiation at 0.810 microm enables visual improvement through pupil enlargement or its shift to the optical centre. The use of the wavelength specified does not cause severe atrophic or cosmetic changes in the iris.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864498","annotations":[{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Wavelength","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.595501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.554409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.474829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Laser diode","weight":0.452948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_diode"},{"name":"Diode","weight":0.126755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Crystallographic defect","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_defect"},{"name":"810","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/810"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"}]}
