{"id":60952,"title":"Varicella zoster immune status in children treated for acute leukemia.","abstract":"Children treated for acute leukemia are at increased risk of severe infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV). We studied the VZV sero-status of children with acute leukemia prior to starting chemotherapy and after completion of chemotherapy. VZV sero-status was assessed using time resolved fluorescence immunoassay (TRFIA) before starting treatment and 6 months after completion of treatment. Prior to starting treatment for acute leukemia, a significant proportion of children (35%) are VZV seronegative. On completion of treatment most patients maintained protective VZV antibody levels; however, 35% had reduced/loss VZV antibody to a level considered non-protective and susceptible to VZV infection.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24789692","annotations":[{"name":"Varicella zoster virus","weight":0.875419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_zoster_virus"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.84096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Chickenpox","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Herpes zoster","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_zoster"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.584601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.537999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.310706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.17896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"}]}
