{"id":53590,"title":"Synthesis, nitric oxide release, and ?-glucosidase inhibition of nitric oxide donating apigenin and chrysin derivatives.","abstract":"?-Glucosidase (AG) play crucial roles in the digestion of carbohydrates. Inhibitors of ?-glucosidase (AGIs) are promising candidates for the development of anti-diabetic drugs. Here, five series of apigenin and chrysin nitric oxide (NO)-donating derivatives were synthesised and evaluated for their AG inhibitory activity and NO releasing capacity in vitro. Except for 9a-c, twelve compounds showed remarkable inhibitory activity against ?-glucosidase, with potency being better than that of acarbose and 1-deoxynojirimycin. All organic nitrate derivatives released low concentrations of NO in the presence of l-cysteine. Structure activity relationship studies indicated that 5-OH, hydrophobic coupling chain, and carbonyl groups of the coupling chain could enhance the inhibitory activity. Apigenin and chrysin derivatives therefore represents a new class of promising compounds that can inhibit ?-glucosidase activity and supply moderate NO for preventing the development of diabetic complications.
