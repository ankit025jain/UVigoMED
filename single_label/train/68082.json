{"id":68082,"title":"[Open versus laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a French center experience].","abstract":"To compare peri-operative outcomes of open radical prostatectomy (ORP) to laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) in a single French institution.Between 1998 and 2003, 72 patients underwent ORP followed by 279 LRP between 2003 and 2010 for a clinically localized prostate cancer. Demographic, peri-operative and pathological data in the ORP and LRP groups were analyzed and compared.In the ORP group, compared to the LRP group, the following significant differences were found: patients were older (63.1 years versus 65.6), initial PSA was higher (10.2 ng/mL versus 6.7) and the proportion of T1c was higher (62.8 % versus 80.6 %). Operative blood loss (1500 mL versus 500) and length of hospitalization (9.0 days versus 6.3) were higher in the ORP group (P<0.001). Operative time was longer in the LRP group (250 min versus 160; P<0 .001). There was no significant difference regarding length of catheterization (average of 8.5 days). Anastomotic strictures were more frequent following ORP (P<0.001). Positive margins proportion in the ORP group (7.1 %) was lower than that observed in the LRP group (28.7 %) (P=0.001). Patients in the ORP group achieved early continence more frequently (P<0.01) but at 12 months postoperatively there was no significant difference.Patients in the LRP group had lower operative blood losses and a shorter length of hospitalization. However, in the ORP group, operative time was shorter and positive margins rate was lower.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560206","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.660335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.630684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.457171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.456423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.438253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"France","weight":0.215934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.155424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Live action role-playing game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"1500","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"2010 Winter Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"10.2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.2"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Group 7 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_7_element"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}]}
