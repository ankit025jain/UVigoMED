{"id":84059,"title":"Evaluation of the magnitude and location of Cam deformity using three dimensional CT analysis.","abstract":"The cam-type deformity in femoroacetabular impingement is a 3D deformity. Single measurements using radiographs, CT or MRI may not provide a true estimate of the magnitude of the deformity. We performed an analysis of the size and location of measurements of the alpha angle (?°) using a CT technique which could be applied to the 3D reconstructions of the hip. Analysis was undertaken in 42 patients (57 hips; 24 men and 18 women; mean age 38 years (16 to 58)) who had symptoms of femoroacetabular impingement related to a cam-type abnormality. An ?° of > 50° was considered a significant indicator of cam-type impingement. Measurements of the ?° were made at different points around the femoral head/neck junction at intervals of 30°: starting at the nine o'clock (posterior), ten, eleven and twelve o'clock (superior), one, two and ending at three o'clock (anterior) position. The mean maximum increased ?° was 64.6° (50.8° to 86°). The two o'clock position was the most common point to find an increased ?° (53 hips; 93%), followed by one o'clock (48 hips; 84%). The largest ?° for each hip was found most frequently at the two o'clock position (46%), followed by the one o'clock position (39%). Generally, raised ? angles extend over three segments of the clock face. Single measurements of the ?°, whether pre- or post-operative, should be viewed with caution as they may not be representative of the true size of the deformity and not define whether adequate correction has been achieved following surgery.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25183585","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.794376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.786795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.151439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Clock","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Femoral acetabular impingement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_acetabular_impingement"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Three-dimensional space","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Point (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)"}]}
