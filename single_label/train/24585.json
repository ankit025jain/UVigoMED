{"id":24585,"title":"Is there a linear relationship between the dose of ruminant trans-fatty acids and cardiovascular risk markers in healthy subjects: results from a systematic review and meta-regression of randomised clinical trials.","abstract":"The effects of ruminant (R) trans-fatty acids (TFA) on the risk of CVD are still under debate. It could be argued that the lack of the effect of R-TFA may be the result of the small amount of their intake. Taking into consideration the growing available data from intervention studies, we carried out a systematic review and meta-regression to assess the impact of R-TFA intake levels on changes in the total cholesterol: HDL-cholesterol (TC:HDL-C) ratio. A systematic review of the literature was conducted and thirteen randomised clinical trials were included, yielding a total of twenty-three independent experimental groups of subjects. A univariate random-effects meta-regression approach was used to quantify the relationship between the dose of R-TFA and changes in the TC:HDL-C ratio. To consider several potential modifiers such as subject and dietary characteristics, a multivariate regression analysis was performed. We found no relationship between R-TFA intake levels of up to 4.19% of daily energy intake (EI) and changes in cardiovascular risk factors such as TC:HDL-C and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C):HDL-C ratios. In addition, a multivariate regression analysis that included other dietary variables, as well as subject baseline characteristics, confirmed that doses of R-TFA did not significantly influence the changes in the lipid ratio. Our findings showed that doses of R-TFA did not influence the changes in the ratios of plasma TC:HDL-C and LDL-C:HDL-C. These data suggest that TFA from natural sources, at least at the current levels of intake and up to 4.19% EI, have no adverse effects on these key CVD risk markers in healthy people.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345440","annotations":[{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.835574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.772597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.758272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.74448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.738775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.715845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.641627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.634756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.627861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.296238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.246599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ruminant","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"High-Level Data Link Control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Data_Link_Control"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Grammatical modifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_modifier"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"R (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Trifluoroacetic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoroacetic_acid"},{"name":"List of psychedelic plants","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_psychedelic_plants"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"}]}
