{"id":80520,"title":"Study of hydatidosis-attributed mortality in endemic area.","abstract":"Cystic hydatid disease is still an important health problem in European Mediterranean areas. In spite of being traditionally considered as a \"benign\" pathology, cystic echinococcosis is an important cause of morbidity in these areas. Nevertheless, there are few analyses of mortality attributed to human hydatidosis.To describe the epidemiology, the mortality rate and the causes of mortality due to E. granulosus infection in an endemic area.A retrospective study followed up over a period of 14 years (1998-2011).Of the 567 patients diagnosed with hydatid disease over the period 1998-2011, eleven deaths directly related to hydatid disease complications were recorded. Ten patients (90.9%) died due to infectious complications and the remaining one (9.1%) died due to mechanical complications after a massive hemoptysis. We registered a case fatality rate of 1.94% and a mortality rate of 3.1 per 100.000 inhabitants.Hydatidosis is still a frequent parasitic disease that causes a considerable mortality. The main causes of mortality in patients with hydatidosis are complications related to the rupture of CE cysts with supurative collangitis. Therefore, an expectant management can be dangerous and it must be only employed in well-selected patients.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632824","annotations":[{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.826157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Parasitic disease","weight":0.810769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_disease"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Hemoptysis","weight":0.750827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.699312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.56808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Mediterranean Sea","weight":0.561334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Echinococcus granulosus","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus_granulosus"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.40717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Case fatality rate","weight":0.260064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Common Era","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Mediterranean climate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"}]}
