{"id":92459,"title":"Evaluation of bone mineral loss in patients with chronic traumatic spinal cord injury in Iran.","abstract":"We described the associations between demographic and injury-related factors on bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine and the hip among adult patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI).BMD in spinal and femoral bone sites were assessed. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between anthropometric and injury-related factors with BMD. Serum level and amount of dietary intake of calcium, phosphor, and 25-hydroxy vitamin D were measured.A referral tertiary rehabilitation center in Iran.Patients with SCI who had no previous history of endocrine disorders and were not on specific medications entered the investigation. Those with non-traumatic SCI, pregnant, or with substance dependency were excluded as well.No interventions were applied. MAIN STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES: Dual X-ray absorptiometry was performed to estimate BMD. Body mass index was positively associated with higher femoral (P < 0.01, r = 0.56) and hip (P < 0.0001, r = 0.82) BMD only in female participants. The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (60%) was noticeable.Older male patients revealed lower BMD only in spinal vertebrae (P < 0.02, r = -0.21). A significant higher BMD loss in lumbar vertebras in male patients with complete spinal cord lesion (P < 0.009) was detected. Spinal reduction of BMD was more severe when the level of injury was above T6 (P < 0.02).Along with the clarification of age, gender, post injury duration, and the other factors' effect on the BMD in the SCI patients, here we have also shown the noticeable prevalence of the 25-hydoxy vitamin D deficiency in these patients which needs attention.","date":"2014-11-15","categories":"Musculoskeletal
