{"id":19457,"title":"Outer membrane protein OmpW is the receptor for typing phage VP5 in the Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor biotype.","abstract":"Phage typing is used for the subtyping of clones of epidemic bacteria. In this study, we identified the outer membrane protein OmpW as the receptor for phage VP5, one of the typing phages for the Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor biotype. A characteristic 11-bp deletion in ompW was observed in all epidemic strains resistant to VP5, suggesting that this mutation event can be used as a tracing marker in cholera surveillance.
