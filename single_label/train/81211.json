{"id":81211,"title":"A comparative study on sealing ability of mineral trioxide aggregate, calcium enriched cement and bone cement in furcal perforations.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the bacterial leakage of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), calcium enriched cement (CEM), and bone cement (BC) as repair materials in furcal perforations.The pulp chambers of 57 human mandibular molar teeth were accessed and the root canal orifices were located. The roots were horizontally sectioned in the middle third. Composite resin was used to fill the root canal orifices and the apical end of the roots. The 1 mm furcation perforations were performed in the center of the pulp chamber floor, using diamond fissure burs. Fifty one teeth were divided into 3 groups. Six teeth were used as controls. Perforation defects were repaired with either MTA, CEM, or BC. A bacterial leakage model utilizing phenol red with 3% lactose broth was used for evaluation. The upper pulp chambers were subsequently filled with 5?L bacterial suspension containing Enterococcus faecalis. Then the top of the assembly was covered with aluminum foil to avoid unintentional contamination. The entire apparatus was incubated at 37Â°C, and bacterial leakage was evaluated daily by checking the turbidity in the culture medium of the lower part of the chamber. The bacterial inoculation was renewed every day, for 30 days. Leakage was noted when color conversion of the culture media was observed and was statistically analyzed using the Chi-square test with significance set at P< 0.05.Sixteen (94%) of the 17 samples of the MTA group, thirteen (81%) of the 17 samples of the CEM group and sixteen (94%) of the 17 samples in BC group were fully contaminated at 30 days. There was no statistically significant difference between the three study groups (P>0.05).According to the present study, in teeth with furcation perforations, the coronal seal produced by MTA preparations was equally to that produced by CEM cement and Bone cement.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Stomatognathic
