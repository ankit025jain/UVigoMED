{"id":66793,"title":"Spontaneous improvement in urological dysfunction in children with congenital spinal lipomas of the conus medullaris.","abstract":"Congenital spinal lipomas of the conus (SLCs) are among the most common closed neural tube defects. The treatment of SLC is an area of controversy because the true natural history of this condition is unknown. Here, the authors present two cases of SLC presenting in infancy with compromised lower urinary tract function, which was objectively confirmed by abnormal urodynamic studies. In both cases, there was spontaneous improvement in urodynamic parameters, with stable normal urinary function at the long-term follow-up. Although cases of spontaneous radiological regression of SLC have very infrequently been reported, they have not been associated with the reversal of already present neurological deficits. This report reinforces the need for further delineation of the true natural history of SLC and highlights the dynamic nature of associated neurological compromise over time.
