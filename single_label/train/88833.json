{"id":88833,"title":"Two novel nonsurgical treatments of carpal tunnel syndrome.","abstract":"This article describes 2 nonsurgical approaches to the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome that are not routinely offered, probably due to a lack of awareness. Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is commonly used for many medical problems, including musculoskeletal issues. OMT of the carpal tunnel is well described and researched, and can be clinically used by a skilled practitioner. The second treatment strategy is a more recent development. The use of ultrasound for guidance of injection is established, but a newer technique using sonographically guided percutaneous needle release of the transverse carpal ligament has shown promising results.
