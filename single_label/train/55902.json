{"id":55902,"title":"Images created in a model eye during simulated cataract surgery can be the basis for images perceived by patients during cataract surgery.","abstract":"To evaluate the images created in a model eye during simulated cataract surgery.This study was conducted as a laboratory investigation and interventional case series. An artificial opaque lens, a clear intraocular lens (IOL), or an irrigation/aspiration (I/A) tip was inserted into the 'anterior chamber' of a model eye with the frosted posterior surface corresponding to the retina. Video images were recorded of the posterior surface of the model eye from the rear during simulated cataract surgery. The video clips were shown to 20 patients before cataract surgery, and the similarity of their visual perceptions to these images was evaluated postoperatively.The images of the moving lens fragments and I/A tip and the insertion of the IOL were seen from the rear. The image through the opaque lens and the IOL without moving objects was the light of the surgical microscope from the rear. However, when the microscope light was turned off after IOL insertion, the images of the microscope and operating room were observed by the room illumination from the rear. Seventy percent of the patients answered that the visual perceptions of moving lens fragments were similar to the video clips and 55% reported similarity with the IOL insertion. Eighty percent of the patients recommended that patients watch the video clip before their scheduled cataract surgery.The patients' visual perceptions during cataract surgery can be reproduced in the model eye. Watching the video images preoperatively may help relax the patients during surgery.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788007","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.792838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.786427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.59798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.580126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.545103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.501005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.497498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Lighting","weight":0.490028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighting"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.118761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Watch","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Poltergeist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Music video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video"},{"name":"Seventy (Latter Day Saints)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)"},{"name":"Frosted glass","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frosted_glass"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Watching","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watching"}]}
