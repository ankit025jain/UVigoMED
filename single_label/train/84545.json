{"id":84545,"title":"Application of silica nanoparticles in maize to enhance fungal resistance.","abstract":"In this study, maize treated with nanosilica (20-40 nm) is screened for resistance against phytopathogens such as Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus niger and compared with that of bulk silica. The resistivity is measured for disease index and expression of plant responsive compounds such as total phenols, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase. The results indicate that nanosilica-treated plant shows a higher expression of phenolic compounds (2056 and 743 mg/ml) and a lower expression of stress-responsive enzymes against both the fungi. Maize expresses more resistance to Aspergillus spp., than Fusarium spp. These results show significantly higher resistance in maize treated with nanosilica than with bulk, especially at 10 and 15 kg/ha. In addition, hydrophobic potential and silica accumulation percentage of nanosilica treated maize (86.18Â° and 19.14%) are higher than bulk silica treatment. Hence, silica nanoparticles can be used as an alternative potent antifungal agent against phytopathogens.
