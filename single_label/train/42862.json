{"id":42862,"title":"Crosslinked poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels with degradable phosphamide linkers used as a drug carrier in cancer therapy.","abstract":"A series of degradable, water-swellable PEGs are prepared using crosslinking between primary amines of N,N',N?-tris(2-aminoethyl)phosphoric triamide (TAEPT) and diglycidyl ether of epichlorohydrin-modified PEGs (EMPs). In the crosslinking process, the glycidyl ether is mainly consumed by the -NH2 of TAEPT and the hydroxyl generated from the opened glycidyl ethers (C-OH), producing degradable phosphonyl-amide frameworks as crosslinked points, and ether bonds as short branches, respectively. Studies on anticancer drug entrapment, chemoimmunotherapy agent delivery, degradation, and biological cytotoxicity in vitro suggest that the generated hydrogels have great potential as biomaterials in biomedical applications.
