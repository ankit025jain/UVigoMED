{"id":30004,"title":"[Somatic consequences of cannabis use].","abstract":"Cannabis can have negative effects in its users, and a range of acute and chronic health problems associated with cannabis use has been dentified. Acute cannabis consumption is rarely lethal but it is associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle accident because of longer reaction time or impaired motor coordination. Chronic effects of cannabis use include generally cardiovascular and respiratory consequences but there are also oral, gastrointestinal, cutaneous and mucous, metabolic, gynecologic and obstetrical, sexual consequences, and cancer But associated tobacco smoking or other potential confounders may explain part of those somatic consequences.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579346","annotations":[{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.80691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Motor coordination","weight":0.761115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.69026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.689003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.625688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.614946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.542531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.474015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.293346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.226206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.134165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Effects of cannabis","weight":0.0261198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_cannabis"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.0245397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Legality of cannabis","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Mental chronometry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_chronometry"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Motor vehicle","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle"}]}
