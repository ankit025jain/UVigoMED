{"id":81782,"title":"Effect of quality of life measures on the decision to remove third molars in subjects with mild pericoronitis symptoms.","abstract":"To assess how quality of life (QoL) measures affect the decision for third molar (3M) removal in patients with mild symptoms of pericoronitis.Healthy subjects, aged 18 to 35 years, with mild symptoms of pericoronitis were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved study. The demographic, clinical, and QoL data were collected at enrollment. The subjects voluntarily scheduled surgery for 3M removal. The principal outcome variable was their decision to undergo or not undergo surgery within 6 months of enrollment. The possible predictor variables in a multivariate logistic regression analysis were the demographic characteristics, dental insurance, and QoL measures.The mean age of the 113 subjects was 23.2 Â± 3.8 years. Of the 113 subjects, 79 elected to undergo 3M removal within 6 months of enrollment (removed group) and 34 elected to retain their 3M at 6 months after enrollment (retained group). A significantly greater proportion of the removed group were white (58% vs 35%; P = .03) and reported having at least \"a little trouble\" with opening their mouths (38% vs 18%; P = .04) and taking part in social life (27% vs 6%; P = .01). The multivariate logistic regression model suggested the odds of electing 3M removal within 6 months of enrollment were greater for those who were white (odds ratio [OR] 2.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 6.32) and those who had at least \"a little trouble\" with interactions in their social life (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.08 to 9.58).In subjects with mild pericoronitis symptoms, experiencing problems with oral function and lifestyle, factors not often considered by clinicians, were significantly associated with subjects' decision for early 3M removal.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24836419","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.892542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.826211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.789854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.714127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.63747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.469117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.376047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.366214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.338388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.127397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social sciences","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"3M","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"White noise","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"}]}
