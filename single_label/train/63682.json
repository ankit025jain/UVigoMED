{"id":63682,"title":"The CBM signalosome: potential therapeutic target for aggressive lymphoma?","abstract":"The CBM signalosome plays a pivotal role in mediating antigen-receptor induced NF-?B signaling to regulate lymphocyte functions. The CBM complex forms filamentous structure and recruits downstream signaling components to activate NF-?B. MALT1, the protease component in the CBM complex, cleaves key proteins in the feedback loop of the NF-?B signaling pathway and enhances NF-?B activation. The aberrant activity of the CBM complex has been linked to aggressive lymphoma. Recent years have witnessed dramatic progresses in understanding the assembly mechanism of the CBM complex, and advances in the development of targeted therapy for aggressive lymphoma. Here, we will highlight these progresses and give an outlook on the potential translation of this knowledge from bench to bedside for aggressive lymphoma patients.
