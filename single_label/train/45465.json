{"id":45465,"title":"ZPDC glycoprotein (24 kDa) induces apoptosis and enhances activity of NK cells in N-nitrosodiethylamine-injected Balb/c.","abstract":"Natural killer (NK) cells have anti-tumor activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using secreting granules and cytotoxic ability. Recently, we isolated glycoprotein from Zanthoxylum piperitum DC (ZPDC) has anti-oxidant effect and anti-cancer effect. The objective of this study was to determine whether ZPDC glycoprotein enhances activity of NK cells and induces apoptosis of liver cancer cells in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-treated Balb/c mice. This study evaluated the secreting of perforin and granzyme B and cytotoxicity of NK cells, interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-12, apoptosis-related factors (bid, cytochrome c, and caspase-3) in liver tissue using Immunoblot and ELISA. The results demonstrated that ZPDC glycoprotein (20mg/kg, BW) induces secretion of perforin and granzyme B and NK cells activity. Also, it induces expression of apoptosis-related factors (bid, cytochrome c, and caspase-3) in liver tissues. Collectively, ZPDC glycoprotein may have potential applications to prevent hepatocarcinogenesis without immunosuppression.
