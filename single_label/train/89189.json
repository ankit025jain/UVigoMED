{"id":89189,"title":"Layperson trauma training in low- and middle-income countries: a review.","abstract":"Prehospital trauma systems are rudimentary in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and require laypersons to stabilize and transport injured patients. The World Health Organization recommends educating layperson first responders as an essential step in the development of Emergency Medical Services systems in LMICs. This systematic review examines trauma educational initiatives for layperson first responders in resource-poor settings.Layperson first-responder training and education program publications were identified using PubMed MEDLINE and Scopus databases. Articles addressing physicians, professional Emergency Medical Services training, or epidemiologic descriptions were excluded. Publications were assessed by independent reviewers, and those included underwent thematic analysis.Thirteen publications met inclusion criteria. Four themes emerged regarding the development of layperson first-responder training programs: (1) An initial needs assessment of a region's existing trauma system of care and laypersons' baseline emergency care knowledge focuses subsequent educational interventions; (2) effective programs adapt to and leverage existing resources; (3) training methods should anticipate participants with low levels of education and literacy; and (4) postimplementation evaluation allows for curriculum improvement. Technology, such as online and remote learning platforms, can be used to operationalize each theme.Successful training programs for layperson first responders in LMICs identify and maximize existing resources are adaptable to learners with little formal education andÂ are responsive to postimplementation evaluation. Educational platforms that leverage technology to deliver content may facilitate first-responder trauma education in underresourced areas. Themes identified can inform the development of trauma systems of care to decrease mortality and physiological severity scores in trauma patients in LMICs.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746252","annotations":[{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.888218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Literacy","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.724382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Curriculum","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.481203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.455971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.42293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.309306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.222769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Layman","weight":0.175555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layman"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.15609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"World","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0424933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Operationalization","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operationalization"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Scopus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Laity","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laity"},{"name":"Certified first responder","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_first_responder"},{"name":"Independent school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_school"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Organization development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_development"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"},{"name":"Leverage (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)"},{"name":"Response to intervention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_to_intervention"}]}
