{"id":36877,"title":"Aorta-to-right ventricular outflow tract fistula with coronary cusp prolapse.","abstract":"We describe a rare case of aorta-to-right ventricular fistula in a 20-year-old man who presented with signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. He was successfully treated by closing the fistula with a Dacron patch from the aortic side. At follow-up, he was asymptomatic with no left-to-right shunt.
