{"id":87990,"title":"Can trauma surgeons manage mild traumatic brain injuries?","abstract":"Current practices suggest that patients with mild traumatic brain injuries (MTBI) receive neurosurgical consultations, while less than 1% require neurosurgical intervention. We implemented a policy of selective neurosurgical consultation with the hypothesis that trauma surgeons alone may manage such patients with no impact on patient outcomes.Data from a level I trauma registry were analyzed. Patients with MTBI resulting in an intracranial hemorrhage of 1Â cm or less and a Glasgow Coma Score of 13 or greater were included. Patients with additional intracranial injuries were excluded. Multivariate regression was used to determine the relationship between neurosurgical management and good neurologic outcomes, while controlling for injury severity, demographics, and comorbidities.Implementation of the neurosurgical policy significantly reduced the number of such consults (94% before vs 65% after, P < .002). Multivariate analysis revealed that neurosurgical consultation was not associated with neurologic outcomes of patients.Implementation of a selective neurosurgical consultation policy for patients with MTBI reduced neurosurgical consultations without any impact on patient outcomes, suggesting that trauma surgeons can effectively manage these patients.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24933668","annotations":[{"name":"Intracranial hemorrhage","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.812099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Glasgow Coma Scale","weight":0.802167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.781457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.682684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.650423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.380612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.30687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"George W.
