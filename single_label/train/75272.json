{"id":75272,"title":"Detection of disease-associated ?-synuclein in the cerebrospinal fluid: a feasibility study.","abstract":"With the aim to evaluate the significance and reliability of detecting disease-specific ?-synuclein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) we developed an ELISA and bead-assay. We used a commercial antibody (5G4) that does not bind to the physiological monomeric form of ?-synuclein, but is highly specific for the disease-associated forms, including high molecular weight fraction of ?-sheet rich oligomers. We applied both tests in CSF from a series of neuropathologically confirmed ?-synucleinopathy cases, including Parkinson' disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n = 7), as well as Alzheimer' disease (n = 6), and control patients without neurodegenerative pathologies (n = 9). Disease-specific ?-synuclein was detectable in the CSF in a subset of patients with ?-synuclein pathology in the brain. When combined with the analysis of total ?-synuclein, the bead-assay for disease-specific ?-synuclein was highly specific for PDD/DLB. Detection of disease-associated ?synuclein combined with the total levels of ?-synuclein is a promising tool for the in-vivo diagnosis of ?-synucleinopathies, including PDD and LBD.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25131945","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Dementia with Lewy bodies","weight":0.824996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia_with_Lewy_bodies"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Molecular weight","weight":0.612962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_weight"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.50073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Lewy body","weight":0.494783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewy_body"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.204334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Synuclein","weight":0.158367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synuclein"},{"name":"Oligomer","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligomer"},{"name":"Monomer","weight":0.133333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomer"},{"name":"Pervasive developmental disorder","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervasive_developmental_disorder"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"}]}
