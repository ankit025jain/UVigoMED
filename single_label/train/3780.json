{"id":3780,"title":"Phase I clinical trial of temsirolimus and vinorelbine in advanced solid tumors.","abstract":"To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of weekly temsirolimus and every other week vinorelbine in patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors.Patients were treated with intravenous temsirolimus on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and intravenous vinorelbine on days 1 and 15. Cycles were repeated every 28 days.Nineteen patients were enrolled in the study. Tumor types included lung (5), prostate (2), neuroendocrine of pancreas (1), bladder (2), uterus (3), cervix (4), and vagina (2). All patients had received prior chemotherapy. Four patients were enrolled to dose level I, nine to dose level II, and six to dose level III. Six patients were inevaluable and replaced. Fifty-seven total cycles were administered. There was 1 dose-limiting toxicity at level II (grade 3 anorexia/dehydration) and 2 at level III (grade 3 hypokalemia; grade 4 neutropenia). Two patients died at dose level III; one was study-related with grade 4 neutropenia. Grade 3/4 toxicities observed during the first cycle included neutropenia (2), anemia (1), anorexia (1), dehydration (1), hyperglycemia (1), hypertriglyceridemia (1), and hypokalemia (1). Best response included two patients (prostate and non-small cell lung cancer) with partial response and eight patients with stable disease with median duration of best response of 3.2 months.Temsirolimus 25 mg given days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in combination with vinorelbine 20 mg/m(2) given days 1 and 15 every 4 weeks was found to be the MTD. This dose combination is considered feasible in phase II trials.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25374407","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Hypokalemia","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypokalemia"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.86885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.836183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.836183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.832947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Dehydration","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.785671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.771006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Hypertriglyceridemia","weight":0.754552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertriglyceridemia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.523343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.472493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Vinorelbine","weight":0.388707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinorelbine"},{"name":"Temsirolimus","weight":0.110635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temsirolimus"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0840959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Stable isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
