{"id":24484,"title":"[Corneal collagen crosslinking in the treatment of infectious keratitis].","abstract":"To investigate the feasibility and clinical efficacy of corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) for the treatment of infectious keratitis.Noncomparative interventional case series.19 patients with infectious keratitis admitted to our hospital between November 2011 and January 2012 were recruited into this study, CXL was performed when medications combined proved poor therapeutic effects. Postoperatively, the graft status, graft clarity, the visual prognosis and postoperative complications were recorded.In 15 cases, there was improvement in symptoms one week after operation.3 cases remained stable, while 1 case reported deteriorated function at the same time.One month after operation, Corneal melting was arrested and complete epithelialization was achieved in 13 cases, 5 cases experienced significant improvement and 1 patient experienced corneal ulcer perforation.2 month after surgery, patients with healed corneal ulcer increased to 17 cases, and 2 cases experienced corneal ulcer perforation. Those 17 cases with healed corneal ulcer were followed up for 6 months, 15 cases had significant improvement in best-corrected visual acuity, 2 cases had no significant change, and no relapse was observed in those 17 cases.Our experience based on the above and other cases suggest that CXL could be an effective tool in battling difficult cases of infectious keratitis. This treatment could present many advantages but will need further investigation both by in vitro and in vivo studies.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433690","annotations":[{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.633026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.592738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.592341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Keratitis","weight":0.429635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratitis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.361381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Corneal ulcer","weight":0.191191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_ulcer"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.133777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"}]}
