{"id":30112,"title":"Endovascular treatment of symptomatic high-grade vertebral artery stenosis.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the initial and long-term results of endovascular treatment (EVT) in patients with symptomatic high-grade extracranial vertebral artery (VA) origin stenosis.From February 2001 to March 2013, 73 consecutive patients (33 men with a mean age of 61.7 ± 8.8 years) underwent EVT for symptomatic high-grade VA stenosis. Preoperative evaluation included Duplex ultrasonography and arteriography. After successful treatment, all patients were followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure and every 6 months thereafter.Successful EVT of the VA stenosis was achieved in 68 patients (93.2%). All procedures were performed without use of cerebral protection. The early complication rate was 5.5%, which included one periprocedural transient ischemic attack, two hematomas at the puncture site, and one allergic reaction to the contrast agent. No in-hospital deaths occurred. During follow-up (mean, 44.3 ± 31.2 months; range, 2-144 months), the primary patency rates at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years were 98.4%, 87.3%, 87.3%, and 87.3%, respectively. Ultrasound Doppler controls during follow-up detected seven VA restenoses (10.3%). Univariate analysis failed to identify any variable predictive of long-term patency of successfully treated VA stenosis.EVT of symptomatic VA origin stenosis is a safe and effective procedure associated with low risk and good long-term results, even without use of cerebral protection devices.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560866","annotations":[{"name":"Transient ischemic attack","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_ischemic_attack"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Duplex ultrasonography","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.634837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Vertebral artery","weight":0.439395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_artery"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.336802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.317942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.294432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.168789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Duplex (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(film)"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"2140s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2140s"},{"name":"Predictive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_medicine"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"}]}
