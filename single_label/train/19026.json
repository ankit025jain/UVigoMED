{"id":19026,"title":"Early vasopressin reduces incidence of new onset arrhythmias.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of early vs late vasopressin therapy on catecholamine dose and duration.We conducted a single-center, retrospective chart review of adult patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit between January 2010 and December 2011 with septic shock requiring catecholamine and vasopressin therapy. Patients were included in the early group if vasopressin was initiated within 6 hours and the late group if vasopressin was initiated between 6 and 48 hours of catecholamine(s).Duration of catecholamine and vasopressin therapy was similar between the 35 patients in the early group and the 36 in the late group. Vasopressin therapy was associated with a decrease in catecholamine requirements in both groups. Early vasopressin was associated with fewer new onset arrhythmias (37.1% vs 62.9%, P<.001). There was no difference in mortality, hospital, or intensive care unit length of stay between the early and late group vasopressin groups (88.6% vs 88.9%, P=1; 14 vs 10 days, P=.48; 9 vs 7 days, P=.71, respectively).Early initiation of vasopressin therapy in adult critically ill patients with septic shock was associated with no difference in total catecholamine requirements but decreased incidence of new onset arrhythmias.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747036","annotations":[{"name":"Catecholamine","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine"},{"name":"Septic shock","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock"},{"name":"Vasopressin","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.716589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.664389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.610738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.496728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.353195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Unit vector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Channel 37","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_37"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
