{"id":922,"title":"Clinical characteristics, treatment patterns and outcomes of Hispanic hypertensive patients.","abstract":"Hispanics are the largest and fastest-growing minority population in the United States, currently comprising about 16.3% (52 million) of the total population. With an increased prevalence of metabolic risk factors in this population, the rate of uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) in Hispanics significantly exceeds the rates observed among non-Hispanic blacks and whites. Unfortunately, data on HTN in Hispanics remains limited due to the under-representation of Hispanics in clinical trials; with most of the data primarily restricted to observational and retrospective subgroup analyses. This article aims to review the available data on prevalence, awareness and control of HTN, risk factors and some of the challenges unique to the Hispanics population. We also discuss treatment strategies derived from large HTN trials that included Hispanics.
