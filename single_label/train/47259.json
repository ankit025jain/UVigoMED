{"id":47259,"title":"[Clinical practice using colon capsule endoscopy].","abstract":"PillCam COLON capsule endoscopy(CCE) (Given Imaging Ltd., Yoqneam, Israel) is one of the most recent diagnostic technologies designed to explore the colorectum. The first generation of CCE was released onto the market in 2006, and the second generation (PillCam COLON 2 : CCE-2), with increased sensitivity, was released in 2009. The CCE-2 has 2 imagers with a much wider angle of view that has been increased to 172 degrees per imager, allowing nearly 360 degrees coverage of the colon by two. The most unique feature of the CCE-2 is its adaptive frame rate (AFR). This new technology allows the CCE-2 to capture 35 images per second when in motion and 4 images per second when virtually stationary. The per-patient CCE-2 sensitivity for detecting polyps > or = 6 mm has been reported as 84%-91%. These recent advancements in this modality might offer physicians the option to screen for colorectal lesions noninvasively.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597367","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.824485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.737028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.602327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.407917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.356982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Capsule endoscopy","weight":0.331912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_endoscopy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.166665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Frame rate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"},{"name":"Angle of view","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_view"},{"name":"Yokneam","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokneam"},{"name":"Given Imaging","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_Imaging"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Electronic imager","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_imager"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Alternate frame rendering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_frame_rendering"},{"name":"Xbox 360","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"}]}
