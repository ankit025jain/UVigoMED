{"id":61966,"title":"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: could immunological tolerance mechanisms be the origin of lymphoid neoplasms?","abstract":"Immunological tolerance theory in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): we suggest that B cells that express B-cell receptors (BCR) that recognize their own BCR epitopes are viewed by immune system as 'dangerous cells'. BCR autonomous signalling may induce constant receptor editing and mistakes in allelic exclusion. The fact that whole BCR recognizes a self-antigen or foreing antigen may be irrelevant in early B cell development. In early B cells, autonomous signalling induced by recognition of the BCR's own epitopes simulates an antigen-antibody engagement. In the bone marrow this interaction is viewed as recognition of self-molecules and induces receptor editing. In mature B cells autonomous signalling by the BCR may promote 'reversible anergy' and also may correct self-reactivity induced by the somatic hypermutation mechanisms in mutated CLL B cells. However, in unmutated CLL B cells, BCR autonomous signalling in addition to self-antigen recognition augments B cell activation, proliferation and genomic instability. We suggest that CLL originates from a coordinated normal immunologic tolerance mechanism to destroy self-reactive B cells. Additional genetic damage induced by tolerance mechanisms may immortalize self-reactive B cells and transform them into a leukemia.
