{"id":86849,"title":"[Facilitating access to care for most-at-risk populations : the Bamako night sexual health clinic experience (Mali)].","abstract":"The estimated prevalence of HIV in Mali is 1.3 % of the general population. The epidemic is concentrated in certain groups, particularly men who have sex with men (MSM) and sex workers (SW). Access to care is limited for these populations, notably because of structural obstacles (e.g. marked social rejection ; health care services poorly adapted to the real needs of these people). Innovative strategies must be envisaged to ensure access to care services and retention in care for these populations. As part of a health promotion process, ARCAD-SIDA, a Malian NGO involved in the fight against AIDS since 1995, set up a night sexual health clinic in 2010 as part of a strategy to more adequately respond to the health needs of these populations. This clinic adapts health service timetables to match the lifestyles of the targeted populations, brings services in closer physical proximity to the places in which these populations live, proposes patient-tailored consultations, works to improve the patients' psychosocial skills, and promotes community-based peer mobilization. In an environment which is generally hostile to MSM and SW, ARCAD-SIDA also works in advocacy, targeting political decision-makers, defense forces and journalists. The NGO has also played a key role in ensuring that these populations are taken into account in the national strategy for the fight against HIV. Since opening in 2010, the clinic has helped reach a large number of MSM and SW and has improved retention in care. This innovative strategy has also enabled the NGO to improve its professional practices in terms of an individual-based approach to prevention. Interventions that are better adapted to the needs and environment of the populations for whom they are intented to have a positive effect on access to and use of healthcare services.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25380379","annotations":[{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Men who have sex with men","weight":0.805258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Reproductive health","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_health"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mali","weight":0.730928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.603689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.526731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Health promotion","weight":0.502939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_promotion"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.470166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Sex worker","weight":0.37894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker"},{"name":"Sexual health clinic","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_health_clinic"},{"name":"Politics","weight":0.297453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"},{"name":"Journalist","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist"},{"name":"Bamako","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamako"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Social rejection","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_rejection"},{"name":"Advocacy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Armed forces","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_forces"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"Peerage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerage"},{"name":"Defense (military)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_(military)"},{"name":"Social structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_structure"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"}]}
