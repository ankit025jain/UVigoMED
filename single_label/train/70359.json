{"id":70359,"title":"Targeting p53-MDM2-MDMX loop for cancer therapy.","abstract":"The tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in anti-tumorigenesis and cancer therapy. It has been described as \"the guardian of the genome\", because it is essential for conserving genomic stability by preventing mutation, and its mutation and inactivation are highly related to all human cancers. Two important p53 regulators, MDM2 and MDMX, inactivate p53 by directly inhibiting its transcriptional activity and mediating its ubiquitination in a feedback fashion, as their genes are also the transcriptional targets of p53. On account of the importance of the p53-MDM2-MDMX loop in the initiation and development of wild type p53-containing tumors, intensive studies over the past decade have been aiming to identify small molecules or peptides that could specifically target individual protein molecules of this pathway for developing better anti-cancer therapeutics. In this chapter, we review the approaches for screening and discovering efficient and selective MDM2 inhibitors with emphasis on the most advanced synthetic small molecules that interfere with the p53-MDM2 interaction and are currently on Phase I clinical trials. Other therapeutically useful strategies targeting this loop, which potentially improve the prospects of cancer therapy and prevention, will also be discussed briefly.
