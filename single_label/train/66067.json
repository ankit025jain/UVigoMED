{"id":66067,"title":"Pharmacologic profiles of investigational kisspeptin/metastin analogues, TAK-448 and TAK-683, in adult male rats in comparison to the GnRH analogue leuprolide.","abstract":"Kisspeptin/metastin, a hypothalamic peptide, plays a pivotal role in controlling gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, and we have shown that continuous subcutaneous administration of kisspeptin analogues suppresses plasma testosterone in male rats. This study examined pharmacologic profiles of investigational kisspeptin analogues, TAK-448 and TAK-683, in male rats. Both analogues showed high receptor-binding affinity and potent and full agonistic activity for rat KISS1R, which were comparable to natural peptide Kp-10. A daily subcutaneous injection of TAK-448 and TAK-683 (0.008-8?mol/kg) for consecutive 7 days initially induced an increase in plasma luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels; however, after day 7, plasma hormone levels and genital organ weights were reduced. Continuous subcutaneous administrations of TAK-448 (?10pmol/h, ca. 0.7nmol/kg/day) and TAK-683 (?30pmol/h, ca. 2.1nmol/kg/day) induced a transient increase in plasma testosterone, followed by abrupt reduction of plasma testosterone to castrate levels within 3-7 days. This profound testosterone-lowering effect was sustained throughout 4-week dosing periods. At those dose levels, the weights of the prostate and seminal vesicles were reduced to castrate levels. These suppressive effects of kisspeptin analogues were more rapid and profound than those induced by the GnRH agonist analogue leuprolide treatment. In addition, TAK-683 reduced plasma prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the JDCaP androgen-dependent prostate cancer rat model. Thus, chronic administration of kisspeptin analogues may hold promise as a novel therapeutic approach for suppressing reproductive functions and hormone-related diseases such as prostate cancer. Further studies are warranted to elucidate clinical significance of TAK-448 and TAK-683.
