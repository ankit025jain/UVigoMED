{"id":19750,"title":"[Ischial osteomyelitis in children. Two case reports].","abstract":"Ischial osteomyelitis is a bone infection that is very infrequent during childhood and is diagnosed by excluding other more frequent conditions. The definitive diagnosis is made with puncture biopsy, which allows instituting targeted antibiotic therapy. We present herein two clinical cases of two children who had a favorable course. In both cases the findings of the initial X-rays were unremarkable. The physical exam did not show total limitation of the coxofemoral joint but it did show ischial tenderness. The MRI showed images compatible with ischial osteitis. The ischial puncture biopsy was diagnostic in both cases. At the 24-month follow-up both children are leading a normal life.Ischial osteomyelitis is an entity to consider in children with coxalgia once other more frequent conditions have been ruled out. The diagnosis is possible with a thorough iconographic study toget.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701764","annotations":[{"name":"Osteomyelitis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomyelitis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.562366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.223314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0827627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Tenderness (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenderness_(medicine)"},{"name":"Iconography","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconography"}]}
