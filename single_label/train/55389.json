{"id":55389,"title":"Corneal refractive power and symmetry changes following normalization of ectasias treated with partial topography-guided PTK combined with higher-fluence CXL (the Athens Protocol).","abstract":"To investigate preoperative and postoperative anterior and posterior keratometry and simulated corneal astigmatism in keratoconic eyes treated with collagen cross-linking combined with anterior surface normalization by partial topography-guided excimer ablation (the Athens Protocol).Anterior and posterior corneal keratometry were measured by Scheimpflug imaging for 267 untreated keratoconic eyes. Following treatment, they were assessed 1 year postoperatively.Before treatment, average anterior keratometric value was 47.06 ± 6.02 diopters (D) for flat and 51.24 ± 6.75 D for steep. The posterior keratometric values were -6.70 ± 0.99 D (flat) and -7.67 ± 1.15 D (steep). Anterior astigmatism was on average with-the-rule (-1.97 ± 6.21 D), whereas posterior astigmatism was against-the-rule (+0.53 ± 1.02 D). The posterior and anterior astigmatism were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.839). After treatment, anterior keratometric values were 43.97 ± 5.81 D (flat) and 46.55 ± 6.82 D (steep). Posterior keratometric values were -6.58 ± 1.05 D (flat) and -7.69 ± 1.22 D (steep). Anterior astigmatism was on average with-the-rule (-1.56 ± 3.80 D), whereas posterior astigmatism was against-the-rule (+0.45 ± 1.29 D). The statistically significant (P < .05) keratometric changes indicated anterior surface flattening -3.09 ± 2.67 D (flat) and -4.19 ± 2.96 D (steep). The posterior keratometric changes were not statistically significant (P > .05).Before treatment, there was a strong correlation between posterior and anterior corneal astigmatism. After treatment, statistically significant anterior keratometric values flattened. The posterior surface keratometric values did not demonstrate statistically significant postoperative change: there was minimal posterior change, despite the significant anterior surface normalization.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24893359","annotations":[{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.851453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.587655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.568416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.562484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Keratometer","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratometer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.0678564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Astigmatism (eye)","weight":0.044168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_(eye)"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Athens","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Excimer laser","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer_laser"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"839","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/839"},{"name":"1 metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_metre"},{"name":"267","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/267"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Scheimpflug principle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheimpflug_principle"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"List of The Muppet Show episodes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Muppet_Show_episodes"},{"name":"Flattening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Flat racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_racing"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"The Model Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Model_Home"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ectasia","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectasia"},{"name":"Optical power","weight":0.0128781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_power"}]}
