{"id":33757,"title":"The spectrum of FBN1, TGF?R1, TGF?R2 and ACTA2 variants in 594 individuals with suspected Marfan Syndrome, Loeys-Dietz Syndrome or Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections (TAAD).","abstract":"In this study, patients suspected of having a clinical diagnosis of Marfan Syndrome (MFS), Loeys-Dietz Syndrome (LDS) and Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections (TAAD) were referred for genetic testing and examined for mutations in the FBN1, TGF?R1, TGF?R2 and ACTA2 genes.We examined 594 samples from unrelated individuals and different combinations of genes were sequenced, including one or more of the following: FBN1, TGF?R1, TGF?R2, ACTA2, and, in some cases, FBN1 was analyzed by MLPA to detect large deletions.A total of 112 patients had a positive result. Of those, 61 had a clinical diagnosis of MFS, eight had LDS, three had TAAD and 40 patients had clinical features with no specific diagnosis provided. A total of 44 patients had an inconclusive result; of these, 12 patients were referred with a clinical diagnosis of MFS, 4 with LDS and 9 with TAAD and 19 had no clinical diagnosis. A total of 89 mutations were novel.This study reveals the rate of detection of variants in several genes associated with MFS, LDS and TAAD. The evaluation of patients by individuals with expertise in the field may decrease the likelihood of ordering unnecessary molecular testing. Nevertheless, genetic testing supports the diagnosis of MFS, LDS and TAAD.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793577","annotations":[{"name":"Marfan syndrome","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.733716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.728598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.564259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.395179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.36878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.328706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.296487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"FBN1","weight":0.144128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBN1"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Aortic dissection","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_dissection"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"594","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/594"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Fox Business Network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business_Network"},{"name":"Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_ligation-dependent_probe_amplification"}]}
