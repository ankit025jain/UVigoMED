{"id":25329,"title":"[Clinical analysis of total aortic arch reconstruction with a novel individualized combined branched stent grafting technique for patients with Stanford A aortic dissection].","abstract":"To compare the clinical efficacy between total aortic arch reconstruction with a individualized combined branched stent grafting technique and total aortic arch replacement combined with stented elephant trunk implantation for patients with Stanford A aortic dissection.Totally 44 patients with Stanford A aortic dissection treated with surgical treatment from January 2007 to July 2013 were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups. Group A (n = 22) patients were treated by total arch replacement with stented elephant trunk procedure. Group B (n = 22) patients received individualized combined branched stent grafting technique. Age, gender and disease severity were similar between the two groups (all P > 0.05). Echocardiography and aortic CT angiography were performed pre-operation and at 1 month after operation.Operation was successful in all 44 patients. Cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic cross clamp time, circulation arrest time and duration of ventilator assisted breathing were significantly longer, postoperative drainage volume and blood transfusion volume were significantly larger and hospitalization cost was significantly higher in group A patients compared those in group B patients (t = 2.791 to 43.465, all P < 0.05). One month after operation, the maximum internal diameter of aorta was smaller than pre-operation in both group A ((33 ± 1) mm vs. (45 ± 6) mm, t = 10.076, P = 0.000) and group B ((33 ± 2) mm vs. (45 ± 8) mm, t = 5.979, P = 0.000) . Left ventricular ejection fraction had no significant difference before and 1 month after operation in both groups (P > 0.05).The total aortic arch reconstruction with individualized combined branched stent grafting technique is technically easier, shortens the operation time, reduces the blood transfusion volume compared to the classical aortic arch operation.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25219559","annotations":[{"name":"Aortic
