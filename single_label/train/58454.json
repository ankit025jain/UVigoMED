{"id":58454,"title":"[Atypical preeclampsia: case report].","abstract":"Preeclampsia that occurs at < 20 weeks of gestation is rare and has been usually reported with molar or hydropic degeneration of the placenta and antiphospholipid syndrome.To describe the clinical presentation of atypical preeclampsia of a patient of 37 years old at her first gestation who developed this entity at 18.5 weeks of gestation. She had history of pre-existing hypertension and infertility. This pregnancy was obtained through in vitro fertility. She reported a severe headache and was admitted to our hospital secondary to elevated blood pressure of 160/110 mm Hg. The laboratory evaluation revealed platelet count 51,000, alanine aminotransferase of 331 UI/L, aspartate aminotransferase of 285 UI/L, lactate dehydrogenase 421 UI/L and urinalysis with +2 proteinuria, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1/placental growth factor ratio 895.5. The diagnosis of chronic hypertension and superimposed preeclampsia and incomplete HELLP syndrome was supported. After termination of pregnancy, the patient improved rapidly. She was discharged home on postoperative day 7 with a blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg with normal laboratory.Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome before 20 weeks of gestation in women presenting with clinical or laboratory abnormalities consistent with this disease.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy
