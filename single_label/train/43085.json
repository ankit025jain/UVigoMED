{"id":43085,"title":"Abdominal near-infrared spectroscopy in preterm infants: a comparison of splanchnic oxygen saturation measurements at two abdominal locations.","abstract":"Splanchnic tissue oxygenation monitoring has been performed at both the liver and the infra-umbilical regions. It is unknown whether these measurements could be substituted one for the other when interpreting splanchnic oxygenation since they have not been measured simultaneously before.To evaluate the feasibility and safety of liver and infra-umbilical near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring in preterm infants with suspected necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and to assess the correlation and agreement between NIRS measurements performed simultaneously at the two abdominal locations.This study was part of a prospective observational cohort study. Preterm infants who were suspected of NEC or who had been diagnosed with NEC were included.Liver oxygen saturation and infra-umbilical oxygen saturation were monitored simultaneously and continuously for 48h by NIRS.NIRS monitoring was performed in 20 out of 24 infants for the entire 48-hour study period. No adverse effects were observed. Values of liver and infra-umbilical oxygen saturation correlated weakly (Spearman's rho=0.244, P<.001). On the Bland-Altman plot liver oxygen saturation was higher than infra-umbilical oxygen saturation (mean difference 6.6%, SD 22.5%).Using NIRS as method for monitoring oxygen saturation simultaneously in both the liver and infra-umbilical regions is safe and feasible. Additionally, we demonstrated that values of liver and infra-umbilical oxygen saturation cannot be randomly substituted one for the other for the purpose of assessing splanchnic oxygenation.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24811448","annotations":[{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.787873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.72107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.700068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.426483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Necrotizing enterocolitis","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrotizing_enterocolitis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.221849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.110833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"NEC","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC"},{"name":"California's 22nd State Senate district","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_22nd_State_Senate_district"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"244","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/244"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Plot (narrative)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Substituent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituent"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Splanchnic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splanchnic"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Rho","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho"},{"name":"Enterocolitis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocolitis"},{"name":"Weak interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"}]}
