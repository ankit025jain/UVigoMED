{"id":47358,"title":"Discrepancies between clinical and autopsy diagnosis in liver transplant recipients - a case series.","abstract":"The utility of the autopsy in patients who have undergone prior orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has not previously been defined. We sought to investigate the role of the autopsy in liver transplantation by comparing the clinically derived cause of death with the autopsy cause of death in a cohort of liver transplant recipients at our institution. This study was undertaken in the setting of declining autopsy rates worldwide. Between 2006 and 2011 twenty-nine patients died who had previously undergone OLT, of on whom 19 postmortem examinations were performed. We retrospectively reviewed all post mortem findings, and separately we examined the corresponding medical records to determine the clinical impression of the cause of death. Discrepancies between the post mortem and clinical findings were categorised according to a modification of Goldman's criteria. Our case series demonstrated a discrepancy between the clinical and post mortem examination (PME) findings in 54% of patients. Two patients had major diagnoses (Goldman Class 1) not detected clinically and in seven patients the PME revealed additional undetected minor diagnoses. This case series demonstrates that, even in the modern era of advanced diagnostic imaging techniques, the post mortem examination continues to be a valuable tool in confirming diagnostic accuracy and improving standards in the care of liver transplant recipients.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592547","annotations":[{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.736112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.323314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0388964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0337886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Ostfriesische Lufttransport","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostfriesische_Lufttransport"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Small and medium enterprises","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium_enterprises"},{"name":"Modern history","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_history"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Goldman Sachs","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs"},{"name":"Classes of United States Senators","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_of_United_States_Senators"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"}]}
