{"id":66193,"title":"The evolution of CT diagnosed papillae tip microcalcifications: can we predict the development of stones?","abstract":"To determine the incidence of computed tomography (CT) identifiable Randall plaques in a CT explored population; to determine the clinical relevance of this radiological finding by a 7-year follow-up; to determine a cut point to identify a population with high risk of developing calcium stone disease (SD).Retrospective study of all patients explored by abdominal CT in our center between January and March 2005.age 30-60 years and no SD. Papillae attenuation was measured on nonenhanced CT in Hounsfield units (HU) and the mean of all papillae was calculated. Patients were re-evaluated after 7 years to identify calcium stone formers. Anamnesis and already available CT, ultrasound, kidney, ureter, and bladder radiograph (KUB) or intravenous urography (IVU) images performed as part of their follow-up were used. In patients with no follow-up, ultrasound and KUB were to be performed. Pearson correlation, Student t-test, and the receiver operator curve were used for statistical analysis.A total of 362 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed; 12 developed calcium SD after 7 years. A significant difference was encountered between the papillae attenuation of stone formers (SF) versus non-SF (47.2HU vs. 35.5HU, p=0.001). There was good correlation between papillae attenuation and the possibility of developing SD (R=0.87). An optimal cut point of 43HU with a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 97%, area under the curve 0.91, separated SF and non-SF.Patients with high papillae density have a higher risk of developing SD. A cut point of 43HU could accurately be used to identify a high-risk population.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735416","annotations":[{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Intravenous pyelogram","weight":0.86732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_pyelogram"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.663118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Microcalcification","weight":0.533174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcalcification"},{"name":"Hounsfield scale","weight":0.435257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounsfield_scale"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.417844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Kidneys, ureters, and bladder x-ray","weight":0.2863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidneys,_ureters,_and_bladder_x-ray"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Nipple","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Godfrey Hounsfield","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Hounsfield"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
