{"id":90189,"title":"Clinical characteristics of neuropathic pain in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics of neuropathic pain in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. We retrospectively reviewed 143 hands in 127 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. The neuropathic pain was determined by using the painDETECT as a self-administered psychometric questionnaire to distinguish neuropathic pain. There were no significant differences in the characteristics of the patients with and without neuropathic pain. However, there were significant differences in the pain scores between those with and without neuropathic pain (p < 0.01). Furthermore, there was a significant difference between the existence of night pain in these patients (p < 0.01). Based on the results of the current study, we conclude that it is important to be aware of, and consider the existence of neuropathic pain during the treatment of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome with night pain or a high score on the numerical rating scales of pain.
