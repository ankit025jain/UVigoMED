{"id":50772,"title":"Ovarian and uterine cancer incidence and mortality in American Indian and Alaska Native women, United States, 1999-2009.","abstract":"We examined geographic differences and trends in incidence and mortality of ovarian and uterine cancer in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) women.We linked mortality data (1990-2009) and incidence data (1999-2009) to Indian Health Service (IHS) records. Death (and incidence) rates for ovarian and uterine cancer were examined for AI/AN and White women; Hispanics were excluded. Analyses focused on Contract Health Service Delivery Area (CHSDA) counties.AI/AN and White women had similar ovarian and uterine cancer death rates. Ovarian and uterine cancer incidence and death rates were higher for AI/ANs residing in CHSDA counties than for all US counties. We also observed geographic differences, regardless of CHSDA residence, in ovarian and uterine cancer incidence and death rates in AI/AN women by IHS region; Pacific Coast and Southern Plains women had higher ovarian cancer death rates and Northern Plains women had higher uterine cancer death rates.Regional differences in the incidence and mortality of ovarian and uterine cancers among AI/AN women in the United States were significant. More research among correctly classified AI/AN women is needed to understand these differences.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754663","annotations":[{"name":"Alaska","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska"},{"name":"Native Americans in the United States","weight":0.650095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.591736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Indian Health Service","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Health_Service"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Alaska Natives","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Natives"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.479339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.344169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Great Plains","weight":0.293126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.292159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.279399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.27488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Pacific Ocean","weight":0.273022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.113354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Plains Indians","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plains_Indians"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"Pacific coast","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_coast"},{"name":"Uterine cancer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_cancer"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Northern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
