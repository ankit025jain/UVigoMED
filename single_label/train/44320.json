{"id":44320,"title":"Anorectal conditions: rectal prolapse.","abstract":"Rectal prolapse, the protrusion of the layers of the rectal wall through the anal canal, may be partial (mucosal) or complete (full thickness). Although prolapse is most common among older women, it affects individuals of all ages, including children. Associated fecal incontinence and constipation are typical. Urinary incontinence and uterovaginal/bladder prolapse also may coexist. Some patients may have rectal ulcers. Diagnosis is predominantly clinical; visualization of the prolapse may require the patient to strain while sitting or squatting. Imaging studies, including fluoroscopic or dynamic magnetic resonance defecography, can confirm the prolapse if the diagnosis is uncertain, and endoscopy can aid in detecting other colonic/extracolonic pathology. Nonsurgical management (eg, increased fiber intake, fiber supplements, biofeedback) often is therapeutic in minor (first- or second-degree) mucosal prolapse and can help alleviate constipation and incontinence before and after surgery for patients with full-thickness prolapse. However, for full-thickness prolapse, transabdominal procedures are the most effective management and are favored for healthy patients, irrespective of age. Perineal procedures (eg, rubber band ligation, mucosal excision) can be used for patients with full-thickness prolapse who are not candidates for transabdominal surgery and for those with second- and third-degree mucosal prolapse.
