{"id":53532,"title":"Changes in iron metabolism and oxidative status in STZ-induced diabetic rats treated with bis(maltolato) oxovanadium (IV) as an antidiabetic agent.","abstract":"The role of vanadium as a micronutrient and hypoglycaemic agent has yet to be fully clarified. The present study was undertaken to investigate changes in the metabolism of iron and in antioxidant defences of diabetic STZ rats following treatment with vanadium. Four groups were examined: control; diabetic; diabetic treated with 1 mgV/day; and Diabetic treated with 3 mgV/day. The vanadium was supplied in drinking water as bis(maltolato) oxovanadium (IV) (BMOV). The experiment had a duration of five weeks. Iron was measured in food, faeces, urine, serum, muscle, kidney, liver, spleen, and femur. Superoxide dismutase, catalase,quinone-oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) activity, and protein carbonyl group levels in the liver were determined. In the diabetic rats, higher levels of Fe absorbed, Fe content in kidney, muscle, and femur, and NQO1 activity were recorded, together with decreased catalase activity, in comparison with the control rats. In the rats treated with 3 mgV/day, there was a significant decrease in fasting glycaemia, Fe content in the liver, spleen, and heart, catalase activity, and levels of protein carbonyl groups in comparison with the diabetic group. In conclusion BMOV was a dose-dependent hypoglycaemic agent. Treatment with 3 mgV/day provoked increased Fe deposits in the tissues, which promoted a protein oxidative damage in the liver.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511298","annotations":[{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.851124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Micronutrient","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronutrient"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.711665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Human iron metabolism","weight":0.668921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_iron_metabolism"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.642497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.604486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.557294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Carbonyl","weight":0.545394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonyl"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.338413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.328656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.272369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.163635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Sediment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
