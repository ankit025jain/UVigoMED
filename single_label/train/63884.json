{"id":63884,"title":"Successful treatment of glucocorticoid and cyclosporine refractory adult-onset Still's disease complicated with hemophagocytic syndrome with plasma exchange therapy and tocilizumab : a case report.","abstract":"A 35-year-old woman was admitted to a hospital because of fever, sore throat, cervical lymph node swelling, and skin rashes. Laboratory data revealed leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and ferritin levels. No antinuclear antibody or rheumatoid factor was found. She was diagnosed as having adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD). Although treatment with high-dose glucocorticoid (GC) and cyclosporine (CsA) was started, her condition did not improve because of complication with severe hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). Therefore, she was transferred to our hospital. Immediately after admission, GC pulse therapy was started again, and treatment with CsA was replaced with tacrolimus (TAC), in addition, plasma exchange therapy was initiated. After treatment, her condition improved. However, 1 week after plasma exchange was discontinued, her condition deteriorated slightly with a slight fever and elevation of CRP level. This indicated that her condition could not be managed with GC and TAC, therefore, tocilizumab (TCZ) was added to her treatment, which improved her symptoms and enabled reduction in GC and TAC doses. Although many reports have indicated that biological agents are effective for refractory AOSD, their safety and efficacy in cases of AOSD complicated with HPS are controversial as these agents may exacerbate HPS. Our present case indicates that TCZ can be used after control of the disease activity by plasma exchange against refractory AOSD complicated with HPS.","date":"2014-01-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24390109","annotations":[{"name":"Anti-nuclear antibody","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_antibody"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Rheumatoid factor","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_factor"},{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Leukocytosis","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytosis"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.825421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Plasmapheresis","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmapheresis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.69774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.601579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.600812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.54127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.333004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.300305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Tocilizumab","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocilizumab"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.223431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Sore throat","weight":0.217942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.209583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.165123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.115375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Throat","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemophagocytic_lymphohistiocytosis"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"}]}
