{"id":92584,"title":"Comparison between pain at discography and morphological disc changes at axial loaded MRI in patients with low back pain.","abstract":"Discogenic pain is induced by axial load, but there are no studies evaluating the influence of dynamic MRI in relation to provoked pain at discography. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between discography-induced pain and morphological disc changes, occurring during axial loaded MRI (alMRI). A secondary aim was to compare and register the frequency of provoked concordant pain at alMRI and discography.41 patients with assumed discogenic pain were investigated with MRI, alMRI and pressure-controlled discography (PCD) (119 discs). Provoked pain at both discography and alMRI was classified as concordant or discordant with daily pain as reference. A concordant discogram required pain intensity ?5/10 (numerical rating scale) at ?50 psi and one negative control disc. A concordant provocation at alMRI required pain intensity ?5/10. The relationship between concordant pain at discography and morphological disc measures (degeneration, height, bulge, angle, area, and circumference) at MRI/alMRI was investigated.Changes in the morphological appearance occurred in at least one disc level in all patients when loaded and unloaded MRI were compared. However, no significant differences between concordant and discordant discograms in terms of morphological disc features at conventional MRI or alMRI were found. 78 % of the patients reported concordant provoked pain during the alMRI.In the majority of patients with low back pain, discography as well as alMRI provoked concordant pain. Loading of the spine, alMRI, revealed however no clinically useful morphological characteristics in the discs with concordant discograms. Alternative or more sensitive diagnostic methods are needed to understand load-induced discogenic pain.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24957259","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.634959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.248255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Low back pain","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_back_pain"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.17535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.157444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.121662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Pounds per square inch","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Numerical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis"},{"name":"Loading","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loading"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Concordant coastline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordant_coastline"},{"name":"Discography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discography"},{"name":"Structural load","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_load"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Discordant","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordant"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Provoked (film)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provoked_(film)"},{"name":"Rating scale","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_scale"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Human back","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_back"},{"name":"PCD (album)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCD_(album)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"}]}
