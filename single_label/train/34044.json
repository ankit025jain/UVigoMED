{"id":34044,"title":"UBQLN2 mutation causing heterogeneous X-linked dominant neurodegeneration.","abstract":"We report a 5-generation family with phenotypically diverse neurodegenerative disease including relentlessly progressive choreoathetoid movements, dysarthria, dysphagia, spastic paralysis, and behavioral dementia in descendants of a 67-year-old woman with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Disease onset varied with gender, occurring in male children and adult women. Exome sequence analyses revealed a novel mutation (c.1490C>T, p.P497L) in the ubiquilin-2 gene (UBQLN2) with X-linked inheritance in all studied affected individuals. As ubiquilin-2-positive inclusions were identified in brain, we suggest that mutant peptide predisposes to protein misfolding and accumulation. Our findings expand the spectrum of neurodegenerative phenotypes caused by UBQLN2 mutations.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771548","annotations":[{"name":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"},{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.872094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Dysarthria","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysarthria"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Spasticity","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasticity"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.712861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.646244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.539455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.433738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.423861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.386474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inclusion body","weight":0.250021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_body"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Inheritance","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Choreoathetosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choreoathetosis"},{"name":"Exome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exome"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
