{"id":38445,"title":"Predicted and measured resting energy expenditure in children with spinal muscular atrophy 2.","abstract":"We investigated in children with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 the consistency of 4 different equations for predicting resting energy expenditure (REE) compared with measured REE by using indirect calorimetry. In patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 2, measured REE was lower than predicted. We also found a correlation between energy consumption and motor skills.
