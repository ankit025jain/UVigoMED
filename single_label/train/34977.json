{"id":34977,"title":"[Pediatric cardiovascular surgical data base registry in México. First report].","abstract":"Current world tendency is the detection of health problems in order to offer solution alternatives by means of the development of computarized data bases.To present the results of a computerized data base developed for the registry of pediatric cardiac surgery with the support of Asociación Mexicana de Especialistas en Cardiopatías Congénitas (AMECC, A.C.).A one-year analysis (from August 1, 2011 to July 31, 2012) of a computerized data base was performed with the support of AMECC and the participation of the most important Mexican institutions for pediatric surgical heart disease health care, particularly for the uninsured population.There were 7 health institutions voluntarily incorporated to the national data base registry, and in the first year of observation, 943 surgical procedures in 880 patients and 7% re-operations (n = 63), were reported. Patients up to one-year old accounted for 38%. The most frequent types of operated congenital heart diseases were: patent ductus arteriosus (n = 96), ventricular septal defect (n = 86), tetralogy of Fallot (n = 72), atrial septal defect (n = 68), and aortic coarctation (n = 54). Elective procedures were 90%, and 62% of them were performed with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Overall mortality was 7.5% with the following RACHS-1 score risk distribution: 1 (n = 4.2%), 2 (n = 19.6%), 3 (n = 22.8%), 4 (n = 12.19%), 5 (n = 1.25%), 6 (n = 6.44%) and not classifiable (n = 2.9%).Although this analysis gives a representative vision of the cardiovascular surgical health care for the uninsured national pediatric population, the incorporation of other health institutions to this data base may lead us to have a most realistic overview in relation to the surgical cardiovascular health care for the up to 18 year-old population.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Congenital
