{"id":67065,"title":"Autophagy inhibition sensitizes bladder cancer cells to the photodynamic effects of the novel photosensitizer chlorophyllin e4.","abstract":"We previously developed a novel photosensitizer, chlorophyllin e4, and found that chlorophyllin e4 mediated-PDT could kill 5637 and T24 cells by inducing apoptotic cell death. Here, we further investigated the new mechanism of autophagy and determined its relevance to apoptosis in e4-PDT. We demonstrated that chlorophyllin e4 was located in both lysosome and mitochondria, and autophagy also occurred in bladder cancer cells upon e4-PDT. More importantly, autophagy played a pro-survival role, and its inhibition enhanced e4-PDT-associated apoptotic cell death because cells pretreated with the typical autophagy inhibitor either 3-methyladenine or Bafilomycin A1 exhibited much lower cell viability and higher apoptotic cell death. Thus, these data imply that the combination of PDT, when mediated by our new photosensitizer chlorophyllin e4, and an autophagy inhibitor might be a promising approach to the eliminationof non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.
