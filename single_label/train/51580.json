{"id":51580,"title":"Comparison of two oral contraceptive forms containing cyproterone acetate and drospirenone in the treatment of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized clinical trial.","abstract":"To compare the effects of combined oral contraceptives (OCs) containing cyproterone acetate and drospirenone in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Fifty-two patients with PCOS were randomized in two groups: group A (n = 26) received 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol + 2 mg cyproterone acetate and group B (n = 26) received 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol + 3 mg drospirenone-containing OCs for 12 months. Baseline clinical features including body mass index, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) score were noted. Baseline biochemical parameters included androgen profile, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid profile, and oxidative stress. The percentages of changes for all parameters were compared.The groups were comparable regarding the baseline characteristics. WHR decreased significantly from baseline (-4 % [-31 to 35]) in group B when compared to group A (0 % [-11 to 14]) (P = 0.033). The total mFG score decreased significantly from baseline (-35 % [-71 to 10]) in group A when compared to group B (-18 % [-72 to 30]) (P = 0.035). Changes in androgen hormone profile were comparable except DHEA-SO4 (-32 % [-53 to 15] in group B vs. -10 % [-49 to 63] in group A; P = 0.046). The effects of the drugs were similar regarding carbohydrate metabolism, lipid profile, and oxidative stress parameters.Cyproterone acetate containing OCs seem to be more effective to treat clinical hirsutism in patients with PCOS after 12 months of treatment.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676694","annotations":[{"name":"Cyproterone","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyproterone"},{"name":"Ethinylestradiol","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethinylestradiol"},{"name":"Hirsutism","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsutism"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.825112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.822923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Combined oral contraceptive pill","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.746453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.715166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.403008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.398346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Waist-hip ratio","weight":0.3325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist-hip_ratio"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.331511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.293263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.150134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.142583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.141581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Drospirenone","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drospirenone"},{"name":"Acetylene","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
