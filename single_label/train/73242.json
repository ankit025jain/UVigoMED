{"id":73242,"title":"[Perspectives of use of polymer carriers of epidoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in cancer therapy].","abstract":"Cancer diseases are an important problem of the contemporary clinical medicine and pharmacology. Chemotherapy using cytostatic drugs has developed in the last 30 years. At present, it is the main method of therapy of metastatic cancers. Cytostatics have an important role in the cancer therapy. They have particular meaning in the therapy of solid and hematological tumors. However, using cytostatic drugs is limited due to their toxic effects on healthy cells. In last years, the decrease of toxicity of cytostatic drugs and the increase of their therapeutic properties are intensively investigated. In this paper, the polymer carriers of cytostatic drugs (mainly epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) and examples of their applications were described.
