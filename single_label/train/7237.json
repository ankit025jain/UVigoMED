{"id":7237,"title":"Foot-and-mouth disease virus low-fidelity polymerase mutants are attenuated.","abstract":"Previous studies have shown that RNA viruses can be attenuated by either increased or decreased viral polymerase replication fidelity. Although foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) high-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) variants with an attenuated phenotype have been isolated using mutagens, no FMDV mutant with a low-fidelity polymerase has been documented to date. Here, we describe the generation of several FMDV RdRp mutants using site-directed mutagenesis via a reverse genetic system. Mutation frequency assays confirmed that five rescued FMDV RdRp mutant populations had lower replication fidelity than the wild-type virus population, which allowed us to assess the effects of the change in replication fidelity on the virus phenotype. These low-fidelity FMDV RdRp mutants showed increased sensitivity to ribavirin or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment without a loss of growth capacity in cell cultures. In addition, decreased fitness and attenuated virulence were observed for the RdRp mutants with lower fidelity. Importantly, based on a quantitative analysis for fidelity and virulence, we concluded that lower replication fidelity is associated with a more attenuated virus phenotype. These results further contribute to our understanding of the replication fidelity of polymerases of RNA viruses and its relationship to virulence attenuation.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888311","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.836766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"RNA virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"RNA polymerase","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Fitness (biology)","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology)"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.739178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Mutagen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagen"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.685513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mutagenesis","weight":0.486727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagenesis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.46082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Attenuated vaccine","weight":0.200993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Philopatry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philopatry"},{"name":"Mutant (Marvel Comics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
