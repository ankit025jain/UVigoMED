{"id":37112,"title":"[Treatment of gouty arthritis in different phases by a series of tongfeng granule: an efficacy observation].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical efficacy of a series of Tongfeng Granule (TG) in treating gouty arthritis patients in different stages.Ninety primary gout patients were randomly assigned to two groups, the TCM treatment group (60 cases) and the Western medicine control group (30 cases). Huzhang Tongfeng Granule in combination of external application of Jinhuang Ointment were given to those in the TCM treatment group in the acute phase, and Yinlian Tongfeng Granule in the remission phase. Diclofenac Sodium Sustained Release Capsule in combination of external application of Jinhuang Ointment were given to those in the Western medicine control group in the acute phase, and Benzbromarone in the remission phase. All were treated for three months. The severity integral of symptoms, effective time, effective rate in the acute phase, the recurrence rate, blood uric acid (BUA), urine uric acid (UUA), serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and the incidence of adverse reactions were observed in the two groups during the course of treatment.The severity integral of symptoms was lowered in the two groups when compared with a former time point (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in markedly effective rate or the effective rate in the acute phase between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was statistical difference in the difference of BUA or UUA between before and after treatment in the two groups (P < 0.05). There was statistical difference in TG and SCr in the TCM group between after treatment and before treatment (P < 0.05). There was statistical difference in TG and SCr in the two groups between after treatment and before treatment (P < 0.05). The recurrence rate was 3.3% in the TCM treatment group (2/60), lower than that of the Western medicine control group (20%, 6/30, P < 0.05).A series of Tongfeng Granule could promote the excretion of UUA, reduce the BUA level in the intermission phase, and play a favorable role in the prevention of relapse. Huzhang Tongfeng Granule could significantly improve inflammatory symptoms and signs of gouty arthritis patients in the acute phase.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and
