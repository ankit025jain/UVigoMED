{"id":74238,"title":"Morphine stimulates cancer progression and mast cell activation and impairs survival in transgenic mice with breast cancer.","abstract":"Morphine stimulates angiogenesis and cancer progression in mice. We investigated whether morphine influences tumour onset, development, and animal model survival, and whether Âµ-opioid receptor (MOR), lymphangiogenesis, mast cell activation, and substance P (SP) are associated with the tumour-promoting effects of morphine.Transgenic mice with a rat C3(1) simian virus 40 large tumour antigen fusion gene which demonstrate the developmental spectrum of human infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma were used. Mice were treated at different ages with clinically relevant doses of morphine or phosphate-buffered saline to determine the effect on tumour development and progression, and on mouse survival. Tumours were analysed for MOR, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, SP, and mast cell activation by immunofluorescent- or laser scanning confocal-microscopy. Cytokine and SP levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Morphine did not influence tumour development when given before the onset of tumour appearance, but significantly promoted progression of established tumours, and reduced survival. MOR-immunoreactivity (ir) was observed in larger but not in smaller tumours. Morphine treatment resulted in increased tumour angiogenesis, peri-tumoural lymphangiogenesis, mast cell activation, and higher levels of cytokines and SP in tumours. SP-ir co-localized with mast cells and elsewhere in the tumours.Morphine does not affect the onset of tumour development, but it promotes growth of existing tumours, and reduces overall survival in mice. MOR may be associated with morphine-induced cancer progression, resulting in shorter survival. Mast cell activation by morphine may contribute to increased cytokine and SP levels, leading to cancer progression and refractory pain.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861561","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"SV40","weight":0.905695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV40"},{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.890996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Fusion gene","weight":0.86885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_gene"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mast cell","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Tumor antigen","weight":0.816036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_antigen"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.781796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.715025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Substance P","weight":0.68837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_P"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.488493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Genetically modified organism","weight":0.436637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.375276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.374513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Opioid receptor","weight":0.278771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_receptor"},{"name":"Simian","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.112555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Lymphangiogenesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphangiogenesis"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Genetically modified mouse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_mouse"}]}
