{"id":77354,"title":"Shift work and employee fatigue: implications for occupational health nursing.","abstract":"Long work hours and irregular shifts are part of the nation's 24-hour society and contribute to employee fatigue. Factors affecting employee fatigue are circadian rhythm, sleep quality and quantity, individual health, the environment, and work tasks. Employee fatigue contributes to accidents and injuries, and affects occupational performance, safety, and health. These findings should be used by occupational health nurses to address fatigue management and develop comprehensive fatigue management programs.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24971821","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.510716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.335489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Employee","weight":0.20264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee"},{"name":"Circadian rhythm","weight":0.196135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.194532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Shift work","weight":0.0310064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_work"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.0197861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Chemise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemise"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"}]}
