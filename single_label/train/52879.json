{"id":52879,"title":"Dietetics in China at the crossroads.","abstract":"?????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ????????????????A dietetics profession that conforms to the international standards for dietetics exists in many countries but not in the Peoples' Republic of China (China). Might China benefit from the presence of the dietetics profession?The article reviews the current dietetic situation in China, summarizes the gaps between current realities in China with respect to meeting needs for nutritional care, and recommends improvements.Gaps and barriers exist between current practice in dietetics and a more optimal system for meeting China's nutritional care needs. Recommendations for actions over the near term that would lead to fuller development of the field of dietetics in China are summarized, following the model suggested by the International Confederation of Dietetic Associations. Alternative personnel deployment strategies over the next decade are also discussed.Whether there is a role for the profession of dietetics in China today or in the near future will depend on the attitudes and political will of Chinese government authorities, health professionals, educators, and consumers.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561968","annotations":[{"name":"People's Republic of China","weight":0.865142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"China","weight":0.712178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.687908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.644842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Politics","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.479993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"International","weight":0.397581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.395494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Teacher","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher"},{"name":"Republic","weight":0.263731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic"},{"name":"Dietitian","weight":0.15609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Government of the People's Republic of China","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"International standard","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard"},{"name":"Canadian Confederation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Confederation"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Diet food","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_food"}]}
