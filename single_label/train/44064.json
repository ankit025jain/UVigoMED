{"id":44064,"title":"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4?-nuclear factor-?B feedback circuit modulates liver cancer progression.","abstract":"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4? (HNF4?) is a liver enriched transcription factor and is indispensable for liver development. However, the role of HNF4? in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remains to be elucidated. We report that reduced HNF4? expression correlated well with the aggressive clinicopathological characteristics of HCC and predicted poor prognosis of patients. HNF4? levels were even lower in metastatic HCCs, and ectopic HNF4? expression suppressed the metastasis of hepatoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Forced HNF4? expression attenuated the expression and nuclear translocation of RelA (p65) and impaired NF-?B activation through an IKK-independent mechanism. Blockage of RelA robustly attenuated the suppressive effect of HNF4? on hepatoma cell metastasis. MicroRNA (miR)-7 and miR-124 were transcriptionally up-regulated by HNF4?, which repressed RelA expression by way of interaction with RelA-3' untranslated region (UTR). In addition, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) up-regulated the expression of miR-21 in hepatoma cells, resulting in decreased HNF4? levels through down-regulating HNF4?-3'UTR activity.Collectively, an HNF4?-NF-?B feedback circuit including miR-124, miR-7, and miR-21 was identified in HCC, and the combination of HNF4? and NF-?B exhibited more powerful predictive efficiency of patient prognosis. These findings broaden the knowledge of hepatic inflammation and cancer initiation/progression, and also provide novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HCC.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752868","annotations":[{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.824817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.813201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.79342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.759104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.721216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.646253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.580917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Protein targeting","weight":0.498826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_targeting"},{"name":"Repressor","weight":0.41588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressor"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.348227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.215536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0903151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte_nuclear_factor_4"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"Ectopic expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_expression"},{"name":"Hepatocyte nuclear factors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte_nuclear_factors"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"RELA","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELA"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
