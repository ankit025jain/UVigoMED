{"id":65869,"title":"Use of a novel hybrid vascular graft for sutureless revascularization of the renal arteries during open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the safety and short-term effectiveness of a novel hybrid vascular graft used to address renal revascularization during open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair, performing a sutureless distal anastomosis.Between 2012 and 2013, 25 patients (16 men; mean age, 66 ± 8 years) underwent revascularization of one (24 patients) or both (one patient) renal arteries with the Gore Hybrid Vascular Graft (GHVG; W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) during open TAAA repair. Specific indications included remote location of the ostium of the renal artery, severe atherosclerotic wall degeneration, focal dissection, and stenosis. All surviving patients underwent computed tomography angiography and follow-up visit at 1 month. Preoperative characteristics, intraoperative data, and short-term results were compared with those of 49 concurrent TAAA patients operated on within the same period by standard renal revascularization (SRR) techniques.All GHVG target renal vessels (26 of 26) were successfully revascularized without technical concerns. No significant differences were found between GHVG and SRR groups in preoperative and intraoperative data, except for a relative prevalence of aortic dissection (28% vs 6%; P = .026) and renal artery stenosis (44% vs 12%; P = .003) in the GHVG group and for intraoperative renal bare stenting that was predominantly used in the SRR group (12% vs 28%; P = .036). The 30-day mortality was 4% in both groups. Postoperative acute renal failure (doubling of creatinine level and creatinine level >3.0 mg/dL) occurred in two GHVG patients (8%) and seven SRR patients (14%; P = NS). Perioperative peak decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate was lower in the GHVG group (26 ± 18 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs 37 ± 22 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .034). At 1-month computed tomography angiography, renal artery patency was 92% for the GHVG vessels, 91% for the contralateral to GHVG renal vessels, and 92% for the SRR group arteries. No GHVG-related complications requiring reintervention or cases of new-onset renal failure requiring dialysis were observed at follow-up.Renal revascularization during open TAAA repair by the GHVG with distal sutureless anastomosis is feasible, especially in cases of aortic dissection, remote location of the renal vessel, and severe atherosclerotic disease of the ostium. Short-term results are satisfactory, at least comparable to those of SRR. Larger series and longer follow-up are needed to assess clinical advantages and durability of this new device.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768367","annotations":[{"name":"Computed tomography angiography","weight":0.901818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography_angiography"},{"name":"Renal artery stenosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery_stenosis"},{"name":"Aortic dissection","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_dissection"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.837652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.835601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.817794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.80318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.622993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.620731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.557707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.536854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.469872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.308957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"}]}
