{"id":36966,"title":"Ultrasound in crystal-related arthritis.","abstract":"In the last decade, an increasing number of rheumatologists have been using ultrasound (US) for assessing patients with gout and calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease. The high reflectivity of the crystalline aggregates and the ability of US to detect even minimal crystal deposits explain the high sensitivity of this imaging technique. Furthermore, the peculiar distribution within the target tissues results in the generation of typical US patterns and explains the excellent specificity of some US findings. The large spectrum of US findings and their wide combination generate different scenarios in different patients and also in the same subject. Such a high variety impaired the standardisation of the definitions of each US finding. This review presents the main US findings indicative of crystal deposits, discusses the available evidence supporting the use of US in patients with gout and CPPD disease, and provides a research agenda to guide further investigations. The combined US examination of the target tissues and the clinically involved sites represents the key issue to obtain the best compromise between accuracy and feasibility, in the daily US assessment of patients with crystal-related arthropathies. Moreover, the US guided aspiration of synovial fluid may enhance the possibility to reach a crystal-proven diagnosis, making US a complementary tool, not in contrast, with microscopy, which rests the current gold standard. Finally, even if at moment other US findings are not included among the typical ones for crystal-related arthropathies, it is possible that in the future, thanks to continuous technological advances, we will be able to identify other specific patterns of pathology.
