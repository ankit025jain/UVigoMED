{"id":79655,"title":"[Analysis of results of technique competition for diagnosis of parasitic diseases in Shandong Province].","abstract":"To understand the capacity of Plasmodium detection and helminth detection and the mastery degree of basic knowledge of parasitic diseases.Three professionals from each city were selected as contestants. The content of the competition contained three parts. The first part included making blood slides and Giemsa staining of Plasmodium, and identification of species and number with microscopy, the second part included making stool slides with Kato-Katz technique and identification of common helminth eggs with microscopy, and the third part was basic knowledge of parasitic diseases.Totally 51 contestants took part in the competition. The average score of the test of making blood slides was 14.8 +/- 3.3, and the passing rate was 82.4%. The average score of the identification of species and number of Plasmodium with microscopy was 19.2 +/- 9.3, and the passing rate was 29.4%. The average score of the test of making stool slides was 9.3 +/- 0.7, and the passing rate was 100%. The average score of the identification of common helminth eggs with microscopy was 28.0 +/- 2.6, and the passing rate was 100%. The average score of basic knowledge of parasitic diseases was 76.3 +/- 11.9, and the passing rate was 88.2%. The average score of the test of making blood slides in the female was higher than that in the male (15.7vs.13.5, P < 0.05), and the average score of the test of making blood slides in the intermediate title contestants was higher than that in the junior title contestants (16.1 vs.14.1, P < 0.05). The average score of the basic knowledge of parasitic diseases in the contestants from cities was higher than that in the contestants from towns (83.2 vs. 72.6, P < 0.05), and the average score of basic knowledge of parasitic diseases in the contestants from high economic level cities was higher than that in the contestants from low economic level cities (82.4 vs. 71.5, P < 0.01).For professionals in Shandong Province, the capacity of helminth detection was strong and the basic knowledge of parasitic diseases was mastered well, while the capacity of Plasmodium detection was weak.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051841","annotations":[{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.804993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.709945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.47894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Giemsa stain","weight":0.34404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giemsa_stain"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.332573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.206147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.145004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Parasitic worm","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Shandong","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Competition","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Town","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Audio mastering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mastering"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"List of human parasitic diseases","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_parasitic_diseases"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Intermediate host","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_host"}]}
