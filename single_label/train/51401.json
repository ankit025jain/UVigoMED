{"id":51401,"title":"Akt and RhoA activation in response to high glucose require caveolin-1 phosphorylation in mesangial cells.","abstract":"Glomerular matrix accumulation is a hallmark of diabetic renal disease. Serine/threonine kinase PKC-?1 mediates glucose-induced Akt S473 phosphorylation, RhoA activation, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1 upregulation and finally leads to matrix upregulation in mesangial cells (MCs). It has been reported that glucose-induced PKC-?1 activation is dependent on caveolin-1 and the presence of intact caveolae in MCs; however, whether activated PKC-?1 regulates caveolin-1 expression and phosphorylation are unknown. Here, we showed that, although the caveolin-1 protein level had no significant change, the PKC-?-specific inhibitor LY-333531 blocked caveolin-1 Y14 phosphorylation in high glucose (HG)-treated MCs and in the renal cortex of diabetic rats. The Src-specific inhibitor SU-6656 prevented the HG-induced association between PKC-?1 and caveolin-1 and PKC-?1 membrane translocation, whereas PKC-?1 small interfering RNA failed to block Src activation, indicating that Src kinase is upstream of PKC-?1 activation. Although LY-333531 blocked PKC-?1 membrane translocation, it had no effect on the PKC-?1/caveolin-1 association, suggesting that PKC-?1 activation requires the interaction of caveolin-1 and PKC-?1. PKC-?1-mediated Akt S473 phosphorylation, RhoA activation, and fibronectin upregulation in response to HG were prevented by SU-6656 and nonphosphorylatable mutant caveolin-1 Y14A. In conclusion, Src activation by HG mediates the PKC-?1/caveolin-1 association and PKC-?1 activation, which assists in caveolin-1 Y14 phosphorylation by Src kinase. The downstream effects, including Akt S473 phosphorylation, RhoA activation, and fibronectin upregulation, require caveolin-1 Y14 phosphorylation. Caveolin-1 is thus an important mediator of the profibrogenic process in diabetic renal disease.
