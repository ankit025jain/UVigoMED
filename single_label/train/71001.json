{"id":71001,"title":"When deletions gain functions: commandeering epigenetic mechanisms.","abstract":"Recurrent chromosomal deletions in cancer are typically thought to harbor tumor suppressors. In a recent publication in Nature, Northcott and colleagues identify a novel region of structural variation in medulloblastoma that leads to oncogenic activation of GFI1B and GFI1 by repositioning these genes next to super-enhancers.
