{"id":77014,"title":"Short leukocyte telomere length is associated with obesity in American Indians: the Strong Heart Family study.","abstract":"Shorter leukocyte telomere length (LTL) has been associated with a wide range of age-related disorders including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Obesity is an important risk factor for CVD and diabetes. The association of LTL with obesity is not well understood. This study for the first time examines the association of LTL with obesity indices including body mass index, waist circumference, percent body fat, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio in 3,256 American Indians (14-93 years old, 60% women) participating in the Strong Heart Family Study. Association of LTL with each adiposity index was examined using multivariate generalized linear mixed model, adjusting for chronological age, sex, study center, education, lifestyle (smoking, alcohol consumption, and total energy intake), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, hypertension and diabetes. Results show that obese participants had significantly shorter LTL than non-obese individuals (age-adjusted P=0.0002). Multivariate analyses demonstrate that LTL was significantly and inversely associated with all of the studied obesity parameters. Our results may shed light on the potential role of biological aging in pathogenesis of obesity and its comorbidities.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861044","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.795339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.531971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Telomere","weight":0.522977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.428067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.315096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.301492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.228197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.210095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.19681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.138087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Long-term effects of alcohol","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_effects_of_alcohol"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Moulting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulting"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
