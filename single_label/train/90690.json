{"id":90690,"title":"Prevalence and risk-factors of neurogenic heterotopic ossification in traumatic spinal cord and traumatic brain injured patients admitted to specialised units in Australia.","abstract":"To identify the prevalence and risk factors in the development of Neurogenic Heterotopic Ossification (NHO) in traumatic brain and spinal cord injured patients admitted to specialised units.An audit protocol was used to gather all clinically relevant data, in specific patient groups, relating to the prevalence of NHO, and was statistically analysed to identify traumatic brain injury (TBI) and traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) patients at high risk of developing NHO.262 TBI and 151 TSCI patients were identified. NHO was diagnosed in 10 and 16 patients with TBI and TSCI, respectively; 18 clinically relevant characteristics were analysed for association with NHO in these patient groups. The only common variables associated with NHO in both neurological conditions were deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary emboli (DVT/PE).The prevalence of NHO in TBI patients is less than one-third of that found in TSCI patients, ~4% and 11%, respectively. This study also suggests that the risk factors associated with NHO in TBI patients are distinct from those identified as risk factors in TSCI patients.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583537","annotations":[{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.844987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.659725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.621785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.616243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.589089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.550248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.409501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.127937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Neurogenic shock","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenic_shock"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Deep vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
