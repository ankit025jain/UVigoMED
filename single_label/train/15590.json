{"id":15590,"title":"Pharmacist addition to the post-ED visit review of discharge antimicrobial regimens.","abstract":"Our objective was to evaluate whether pharmacist addition to the postvisit review of discharged adult emergency department (ED) visits' prescriptions/cultures would reduce the prevalence of revised antimicrobial regimen inappropriateness.We conducted a retrospective observational study of discharged adult ED visits to a single center with positive cultures requiring antimicrobial regimen revision (May 1 to October 31, 2012, nurse process; February 1 to July 31, 2013, nurse/pharmacist process). Investigators abstracted cohorts' medical records for demographic, ED diagnosis, original/revised antibiotic regimen, culture result, medical history, medications, and patient instruction data and determined whether the revised regimen was inappropriate based on Infectious Diseases Society of America/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and clinical guidelines. We used the large sample z-test to compare the prevalence of revised antimicrobial regimen inappropriateness between the 2 cohorts.In the prepharmacist cohort, there were 411 positive ED discharge cultures. Seventy-three (17.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.1%-21.5%) required antimicrobial regimen revision; 34 of these met 1 or more level of inappropriateness (46.6%; 95% CI, 35.1%-58.0%). In the postpharmacist cohort, there were 459 positive ED discharge cultures. Seventy-five (16.3%; 95% CI, 13.0%-19.7%) required revision; 11 of these met 1 or more level of inappropriateness (14.7%; 95% CI, 6.7%-22.7%; z = 4.2; P < .0001 for comparison).In this single-center study, pharmacist addition to the postvisit review of discharged adult ED patients' prescriptions/cultures reduced the prevalence of revised antimicrobial regimen inappropriateness.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25171797","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.769534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.670012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.663604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.635569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.582332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.420555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.327758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
