{"id":82144,"title":"Effect of frequent application of low-level laser therapy on corticotomized tooth movement in dogs: a pilot study.","abstract":"The purposes of the present study were to evaluate the effects of frequent applications of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on corticotomy-assisted tooth movement in a beagle dog model and to compare the effects in the mandible and maxilla.In 4 male beagles, the maxillary and mandibular second premolars were extracted. The third premolars were corticotomized and then protracted from the canines with a continuous force of 200 g. Daily LLLT (using an aluminum gallium indium phosphide [AlGaInP] diode) was applied at the buccal mucosa of the corticotomized premolars on 1 side only. The tooth movement was measured for 8 weeks. Fluorochromes were injected intravenously at the start of the experiment (T0) and after 2 (T2), 4 (T4), and 8 (T8) weeks to evaluate new bone formation on the tension sides. Histomorphometric and immunohistologic evaluations were performed.In the mandible, the movement of the corticotomized premolars in the LLLT plus corticotomy group was less than that in the corticotomy-only group, although the difference was not statistically significant. In the maxilla, no significant differences between the 2 groups were found. Osteoclastic and proliferating cell activities and the amount of new bone formation were greater in the mandibular LLLT plus corticotomy group than in the corticotomy-only group.The frequent application of LLLT showed no significant effect on the corticotomized tooth movement.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704036","annotations":[{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.864015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.817144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.769954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Canine tooth","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.557549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.508439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.375564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Phosphorus","weight":0.204301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Laser medicine","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_medicine"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Beagle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle"},{"name":"Gallium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium"},{"name":"Indium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Horse gait","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gait"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Aluminium","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}]}
