{"id":44834,"title":"Comprehensive analysis of vascular endothelial growth factor-C related factors in stomach cancer.","abstract":"Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), which contributes to lymphatic metastasis (LM) in malignant disease, is one of the most important factors involved in physical and pathological lymphangiogenesis. Some VEGF-C related factors such as sine oculis homeobox homolog (SIX) 1, contactin (CNTN) 1 and dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) 6 have been extensively studied in malignancies, but their expression levels and associations have still to be elucidated in stomach cancer.We detected their expression levels in 30 paired stomach cancer tissues using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression and clinical significance of each factor was analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank sum test. The correlation among all the factors was performed by Spearman rank correlation analysis.The results suggest that VEGF-C and CNTN1 are significantly correlated with tumor size, SIX1 with the age and CNTN1 also with the cTNM stage. There are significant correlations of expression levels among VEGF-C, SIX1, CNTN1 and DUSP6.There exists an important regulatory crosstalk involving SIX1, VEGF-C, CNTN1 and DUSP6 in stomach cancer.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716913","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.844331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.807775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.683448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.652575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Homeobox","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeobox"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.41286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.253016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Lymphangiogenesis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphangiogenesis"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Crosstalk (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosstalk_(biology)"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor C","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_C"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"}]}
