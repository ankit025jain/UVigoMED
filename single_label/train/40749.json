{"id":40749,"title":"Ondansetron for food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome.","abstract":"Recently, a study on 5 patients [Holbrook et al.: J Allergy Clin Immunol 2013;132:1219-1220] documented the efficacy of the intravenous administration of ondansetron in children with acute symptoms due to food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES). We report on the experience at our institution using ondansetron during oral food challenge (OFC) in 5 children affected by FPIES. In all 5 cases, the use of intramuscular ondansetron led to a complete and rapid resolution of symptoms within 15 min. Intramuscular administration, without the need for intravenous access for an infusion or steroid administration, enables this therapy to be easily performed, even at home (i.e. out of a hospital setting). A home treatment with ondansetron cannot be considered as an alternative to a medical examination with eventual treatment in hospital, which is advised after any acute episode of FPIES. We consider ondansetron to be very useful in the management of acute FPIES. Further study is required to confirm its efficacy.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993542","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.672546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.59418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Ondansetron","weight":0.543186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondansetron"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.455046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.454422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Oceania Football Confederation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania_Football_Confederation"},{"name":"Enterocolitis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocolitis"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"}]}
