{"id":55484,"title":"Refractive changes after lens-sparing vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.","abstract":"To evaluate refractive changes after lens-sparing vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD).Retrospective case series.A retrospective chart review was conducted in 66 eyes of 66 patients (50.0 Â± 9.9 years old) who had undergone lens-sparing vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous RD. Spherical equivalent refractive power was evaluated before and 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months after vitrectomy. The relation between refractive changes and several parameters was investigated, such as axial length, presence of preoperative hemorrhage, preoperative spherical equivalent, retinal tear size, logMAR best-corrected visual acuity, number of laser photocoagulations, occurrence of postoperative vitreous hemorrhage, and degree of postoperative inflammatory reaction. Surgical parameters examined included operative time, wide-angle viewing system use, intraoperative adjuvant and gas tamponade use, vitrectomy system gauge, and surgeon.Significant and continuous myopic shift was observed after vitrectomy throughout the study period. Spherical equivalent was not significantly different between the operated eyes and the fellow control eyes until 3 months after vitrectomy, but the operated eyes were significantly more myopic at 3 months and later postoperatively (P < .05). Of the 58 eyes finally included (8 patients lost to follow-up), 27 (47%) underwent cataract surgery after vitrectomy. Patients who underwent cataract surgery were significantly older than those who did not (P < .05); no other examined parameter was significantly different between groups.A significant myopic progression occurred in eyes after lens-sparing vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous RD. A considerable amount of anisometropia occurred, even in the early postoperative period. Patient age was the only risk factor with the potential to advance the nuclear sclerotic cataract progression after vitrectomy.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24874997","annotations":[{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.839817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Anisometropia","weight":0.747825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisometropia"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.672859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.548874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.545714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Optical power","weight":0.47066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_power"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.400137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.294143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.251433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.108111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Dietitian","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Tamponade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamponade"},{"name":"Electric power","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"}]}
