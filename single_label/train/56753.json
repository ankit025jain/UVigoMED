{"id":56753,"title":"Successful use of anti-VEGF treatment for subretinal hemorrhage and fluid in a young patient with choroidal osteoma.","abstract":"The authors report the use of an anti-VEGF agent in the resolution of subretinal fluid and hemorrhage with improvement in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in a patient with choroidal osteoma. The reported case involves a 20-year-old man who presented with a choroidal osteoma and chronic subretinal fluid associated with hemorrhage. He was treated with six intravitreal doses of bevacizumab over a 13-month period. The fluid resolved and his BCVA improved with these treatments. Intravitreal bevacizumab can be used to successfully treat subretinal fluid associated with choroidal osteomas and may lead to an improvement in BCVA.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635160","annotations":[{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.745759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.447438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.392857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Osteoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoma"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"}]}
