{"id":45639,"title":"Correlation of OAS1 gene polymorphism at exon 7 splice accepter site with interferon-based therapy of HCV infection in Pakistan.","abstract":"The most useful treatment for HCV infection worldwide is peg-interferon plus ribavirin, although the response varies from person to person. Hence, host genetics are significantly involved in the treatment response to HCV infection. The 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) is one of the most important components of the immune system having significant antiviral functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the exon 7 splice acceptor site (SAS) of OAS1 to interferon-based therapy of HCV infection. OAS1 genotyping was performed in 140 HCV patients by restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction method (RFLP-PCR). These patients were enrolled for the study in 2010-2013. OAS1 SNP was also established in 120 healthy controls. Correlation of HCV genotypes, OAS1 SNP, and other factors with response to interferon therapy were statistically analyzed by SPSS 13 software. There were no significant differences in the distribution of OAS1 genotypes between healthy and patients subjects. The distribution of AG and AA genotypes of OAS1 genotypes between sustained virological responders (SVRs) and the non-responders (NRs) group were also comparable. However, Pearson chi square analysis indicated that the patients possessing a GG genotype of the OAS1 gene at exon 7 SAS demonstrated significantly positive association with treatment response to HCV infection (p=0.039). This study determined that SNP at exon 7 SAS of OAS1 was significantly associated with response to interferon-based therapy of HCV infection in our population.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673406","annotations":[{"name":"Exon","weight":0.905841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Restriction fragment length polymorphism","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.762881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.741885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.727131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.717633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.649771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.622433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.581245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.5063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.46581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ligase","weight":0.360654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligase"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.357513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.345095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.329746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.0917399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Electron acceptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_acceptor"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Organization of American States","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_American_States"},{"name":"Restriction fragment","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment"}]}
