{"id":69700,"title":"5-Aza-CdR delivers a gene body blow.","abstract":"In this issue of Cancer Cell, Yang etÂ al. describe a causal relationship between gene body methylation and gene expression and a role for genic methylation in response to clinical DNA methylation inhibitors, which suggests that the mechanism of action of these inhibitors includes gene body hypomethylation-induced downregulation of cancer-associated genes.
