{"id":47363,"title":"Optimal use of proton pump inhibitors for treating acid peptic diseases in primary care.","abstract":"Heartburn, reflux and epigastric pain are frequently encountered symptoms in primary care medicine. Acid peptic diseases such as peptic ulcer and gastrointestinal reflux disease have a high prevalence, can have important impact on patient quality of life and represent a considerable health care cost. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most potent pharmacological inhibitors of gastric acid secretion currently available and are the mainstay medical therapy for acid peptic diseases. This review summarizes current evidence on treatment of acid-peptic diseases with proton pump inhibitors and provides primary care clinicians with best practice guidelines for optimal use of these drugs.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592542","annotations":[{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Gastric acid","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.744297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Epigastrium","weight":0.725586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigastrium"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.289447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.235714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.204947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.204374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Heartburn","weight":0.119686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartburn"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"}]}
