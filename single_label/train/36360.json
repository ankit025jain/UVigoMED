{"id":36360,"title":"Demonstration of doubly committed juxta-arterial ventricular septal defect with aortic valve prolapse by cardiac computed tomography.","abstract":"A 24-year-old man presented to our hospital with symptoms of dyspnea and palpitation for 2 weeks. Cardiac CT showed not only a leaflet coaptation defect in the aortic valve but also a small ventricular septal defect (VSD) immediately beneath the prolapsed right coronary cusp. A shunt flow in the direction of the right ventricular outflow tract though the defect indicated the doubly committed juxta-arterial type of VSD. A doubly committed juxta-arterial VSD of 3Â mm was confirmed and repaired via pulmonary arteriotomy.
