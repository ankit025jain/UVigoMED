{"id":65890,"title":"Renal cell carcinoma with infrahepatic vena caval tumor thrombus treated with a novel combined retroperitoneal and transperitoneal pure laparoscopic procedure.","abstract":"A 61-year-old male patient presented with intermittent gross hematuria. A right renal mass with infrahepatic vena caval tumor thrombus was found using magnetic resonance imaging. We undertook a novel combined retroperitoneal and transperitoneal pure laparoscopic nephrectomy with vena caval thrombectomy for this patient. The patient recovered well after surgery and discharged on day 6. A clear cell renal cell carcinoma with venous extension was confirmed by pathologic assay. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a novel hybrid surgical strategy.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767537","annotations":[{"name":"Hematuria","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Embolectomy","weight":0.775647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolectomy"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.762764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Gross examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_examination"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
