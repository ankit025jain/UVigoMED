{"id":46734,"title":"Treatment of acute hepatitis C in breast cancer patient: a case report.","abstract":"Oncologists worldwide are often dealing with hepatitis C virus positive breast cancer patients, questioning adequate chemotherapy protocol, reduction of doses, delays, or even interruptions of treatment. We present a case of a woman in stage IIIB breast cancer, who after the completion of neoadjuvant treatment developed significant increase in liver enzymes and was diagnosed positive for HCV. She was treated with interferon and after the resolving of acute liver disease continued concomitant treatment with interferon, ribavirin, docetaxel, and trastuzumab. Grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 hepatotoxicity occurred after the third cycle of chemo and 5 months of antiviral therapy. Interferon and chemotherapy were postponed for 1 week. There are no sufficient data in order to recommend the concomitant antiviral and antineoplastic therapy. Hepatitis C virus and antiviral therapy may increase the toxicities of antineoplastic treatment. However, when lifesaving oncologic treatment is necessary, concomitant antiviral therapy can be administered with more intensive follow up.
