{"id":65679,"title":"Magnetic resonance imaging of pelvic metastases in male patients.","abstract":"Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging offers a noninvasive tool for diagnosis of primary and metastatic pelvic tumors. The diagnosis of a pelvic metastatic lesion implies an adverse prognosis and dictates the management strategies. Knowledge of normal MR imaging anatomy of the pelvis and the signal characteristics of normal and abnormal structures is essential for accurate interpretation of pelvic MR imaging. This article reviews imaging manifestations of nodal, visceral, and musculoskeletal metastatic lesions of the pelvis along with current and evolving MR imaging techniques.
