{"id":83677,"title":"The anatomical footprint of the Achilles tendon: a cadaveric study.","abstract":"We dissected 12 fresh-frozen leg specimens to identify the insertional footprint of each fascicle of the Achilles tendon on the calcaneum in relation to their corresponding muscles. A further ten embalmed specimens were examined to confirm an observation on the retrocalcaneal bursa. The superficial part of the insertion of the Achilles tendon is represented by fascicles from the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle, which is inserted over the entire width of the inferior facet of the calcaneal tuberosity. In three specimens this insertion was in continuity with the plantar fascia in the form of periosteum. The deep part of the insertion of the Achilles tendon is made of fascicles from the soleus tendon, which insert on the medial aspect of the middle facet of the calcaneal tuberosity, while the fascicles of the lateral head of the gastrocnemius tendon insert on the lateral aspect of the middle facet of the calcaneal tuberosity. A bicameral retrocalcaneal bursa was present in 15 of the 22 examined specimens. This new observation and description of the insertional footprint of the Achilles tendon and the retrocalcaneal bursa may allow a better understanding of the function of each muscular part of the gastrosoleus complex. This may have clinical relevance in the treatment of Achilles tendinopathies.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25274919","annotations":[{"name":"Triceps surae muscle","weight":0.901267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceps_surae_muscle"},{"name":"Soleus muscle","weight":0.899375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soleus_muscle"},{"name":"Gastrocnemius muscle","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrocnemius_muscle"},{"name":"Achilles tendon","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon"},{"name":"Periosteum","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum"},{"name":"Calcaneus","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcaneus"},{"name":"Plantar fascia","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_fascia"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Synovial bursa","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_bursa"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Tubercle (anatomy)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubercle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.589089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.503407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Plantar","weight":0.260052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar"},{"name":"Zygapophysial joint","weight":0.205451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygapophysial_joint"},{"name":"Achilles","weight":0.14701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles"},{"name":"Human anatomical terms","weight":0.122221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms"},{"name":"Superficial palmar arch","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superficial_palmar_arch"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Tendinopathy","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinopathy"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Embalming","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embalming"}]}
