{"id":83133,"title":"[Class III surgical patients facilitated by accelerated osteogenic orthodontic treatment].","abstract":"To evaluate the treatment time and the anterior and posterior teeth movement pattern as closing extraction space for the Class III surgical patients facilitated by accelerated osteogenic orthodontic treatment.There were 10 skeletal Class III patients in accelerated osteogenic orthodontic group (AOO) and 10 patients in control group. Upper first premolars were extracted in all patients. After leveling and alignment (T2), corticotomy was performed in the area of maxillary anterior teeth to accelerate space closing.Study models of upper dentition were taken before orthodontic treatment (T1) and after space closing (T3). All the casts were laser scanned, and the distances of the movement of incisors and molars were digitally measured. The distances of tooth movement in two groups were recorded and analyzed.The alignment time between two groups was not statistically significant. The treatment time in AOO group from T2 to T3 was less than that in the control group (less than 9.1 ± 4.1 months). The treatment time in AOO group from T1 to T3 was less than that in the control group (less than 6.3 ± 4.8 months), and the differences were significant (P < 0.01). Average distances of upper incisor movement (D1) in AOO group and control group were (2.89 ± 1.48) and (3.10 ± 0.95) mm, respectively. Average distances of upper first molar movement (D2) in AOO group and control group were (2.17 ± 1.13) and (2.45 ± 1.04) mm, respectively.No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups (P > 0.05).Accelerated osteogenic orthodontic treatment could accelerate space closing in Class III surgical patients and shorten preoperative orthodontic time. There were no influence on the movement pattern of anterior and posterior teeth during pre-surgical orthodontic treatment.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438566","annotations":[{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.896071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.757791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.720809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.386738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.321693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.127396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0319263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Music download","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_download"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Ordnance QF 95 mm Howitzer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_QF_95_mm_Howitzer"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"}]}
