{"id":28486,"title":"Antimicrobial stewardship interventions: thinking inside and outside the box.","abstract":"At present, less than half of all acute health care facilities have antimicrobial stewardship programs. By targeting areas that are vulnerable to inappropriate antimicrobial use and by using novel strategies to increase the reach of stewardship interventions, providers can make antimicrobial stewardship a universal practice in all health care settings. This review discusses how stewardship can make large impacts in areas where it has traditionally been absent in facilities both with and without formal antimicrobial stewardship programs.
