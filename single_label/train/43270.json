{"id":43270,"title":"Statin use is associated with a decreased risk of Barrett's esophagus.","abstract":"Statins have been associated with a reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, but little is known about their effect on development of Barrett's esophagus. We evaluated the association between statins and risk of Barrett's esophagus.We conducted a case-control study among eligible patients scheduled for elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy and patients eligible for screening colonoscopy, recruited from primary care clinics at a Veterans Affairs center. We compared 303 patients with Barrett's esophagus with 2 separate sex-matched control groups: 606 elective endoscopy controls and 303 primary care controls without Barrett's esophagus. Use of statins and other lipid-lowering medications was ascertained by reviewing filled prescriptions in electronic pharmacy records during a 10-year period before the Barrett's esophagus diagnosis date for patients and study endoscopy date for controls. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using conditional multivariable logistic-regression models among 276 patients and 828 controls further matched on age.A smaller proportion of Barrett's esophagus patients filled statin prescriptions (57.4%) than endoscopy controls (64.9%; P = .029) or primary care controls (71.3%; P < .001). Controls had longer durations of statin prescriptions filled than patients (28.6 vs 22.1 months; P = .001). Statin use was associated with a significantly lower risk of Barrett's esophagus (adjusted OR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.38-0.87) compared with the combined control groups. The risk of Barrett's esophagus was especially lower with statin use among obese patients (OR = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.09-0.71), as was the risk for Barrett's esophagus segments ? 3 cm (OR = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.06-0.30). We found no significant association between Barrett's esophagus and nonstatin lipid-lowering medications (P = .452).In a case-control study of veterans, statin use was associated with a reduced risk of Barrett's esophagus. The greatest level of risk reduction was observed for obese patients and for long-segment Barrett's esophagus.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798416","annotations":[{"name":"Statin","weight":0.902441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.821645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.690903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.515535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.484575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.475581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.424648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.413143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.286895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.151332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0970929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"United States Department of Veterans Affairs","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"828","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/828"},{"name":"380","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/380"},{"name":"303","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/303"},{"name":"276","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/276"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Barrett","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Risk management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Veteran","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran"},{"name":"Maternal death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Salmson 9","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmson_9"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
