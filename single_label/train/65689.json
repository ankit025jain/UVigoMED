{"id":65689,"title":"Incidence and risk factors of 30-day early and 90-day late morbidity and mortality of radical cystectomy during a 13-year follow-up: a comparative propensity-score matched analysis of complications between neobladder and ileal conduit.","abstract":"We report on the short and late morbidity and mortality of ileal conduit and neobladder after radical cystectomy with their associated risk factors.We retrospectively collected data on 308 non-metastatic bladder cancer patients who underwent radical cystectomy with either ileal conduit or neobladder for a curative intent from January 1999 to December 2011. Post-operative morbidity and mortality of 30-day (early) and 90-day (late) complication with their risk factors were examined in association with different types of urinary diversion. A comparative analysis using propensity-score matching was performed with matching variables of age, sex, number of underlying diseases and pathologic T and N stages, lymph node dissection, operative time and time of surgical year for comparison of the early and late morbidities between ileal conduit and neobladder.During the median follow-up of 46.6 months, early and late morbidities were 29.5% (n=91) and 19.8% (n=61), and complication-related mortalities were 2.2 and 6.6%, respectively. The type of urinary diversion significantly affected only the late complications (early: neobladder 57 vs. ileal conduit 47, P=0.096; late: neobladder 67 vs. ileal conduit 37, P<0.001). However, after propensity-score matching, no significant differences in early and late morbidities were observed between neobladder and ileal conduit. For risk factors of morbidity, number of removed lymph node states and hypertension were independently significant for both early and late complications (P<0.05).The type of urinary diversion affected only late complication, however, results of the matching analysis showed no significant differences in early and late morbidities between neobladder and ileal conduit.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791782","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.799132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.777552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.705394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.498222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.321269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ileal conduit urinary diversion","weight":0.207628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileal_conduit_urinary_diversion"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.199121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.141968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Urinary diversion","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_diversion"}]}
