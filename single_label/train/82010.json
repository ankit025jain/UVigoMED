{"id":82010,"title":"Clinical safety, quality and effect of resin infiltration for proximal caries.","abstract":"Resin infiltration of proximal lesions is a new approach to stop caries progression. The aim of this clinical trial was to assess its safety and quality, as well as the therapeutic effect.In 47 children, adolescents and young adults, ten dentists applied the infiltration material ICON (DMG, Germany) on initial proximal lesions according to the manufacturer's instruction. One lesion with radiographic extension into enamel or the outer third of dentin per participant was allocated for the treatment. The clinical safety and quality of resin infiltration were assessed 1 week, 6 months and 12 months after the treatment and the evaluation of the therapeutic effect was analysed by pair-wise radiographs.The clinical safety and quality of the infiltration were assessed in 45 individuals after 12 months. The test surfaces showed no relevant changes in clinical status, plaque accumulation or gingival status (p > 0.05). A high quality of infiltration was found for the marginal adaptation. In contrast to the improvement of colour at the one-week recall (p = 0.005), the infiltrated surfaces showed a statistically significant increase in the discoloration within the following year (p = 0.014). Out of the 43 lesions which could be assessed radiographically, only two lesions showed progression to a different score (4.7%).Resin infiltration can be considered a safe and effective treatment to reduce progression of initial proximal caries.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745591","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.602659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.448823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.375316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.360089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.0542089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Product recall","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_recall"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Participant observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participant_observation"},{"name":"DMG Radio Australia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMG_Radio_Australia"}]}
