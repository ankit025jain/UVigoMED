{"id":74510,"title":"[Efficacy comparison between acupuncture smoothing-liver and regulating-spleen method and regulating Governor Vessel method for menopausal insomnia].","abstract":"To compare the efficacy difference among acupuncture smoothing-liver and regulating-spleen method, regulating Governor Vessel method and oral administration of western medicine for menopausal insomnia.One hundred and fifty-six cases of menopausal insomnia were randomized into a smoothing-liver and regulating-spleen group (group A), a regulating Governor Vessel group (group B) and a medication group (group C), 52 cases in each one. Acupuncture at Zhongwan (CV 12), Daheng (SP 15), Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and Taichong (LR 3), etc. was applied in the group A; acupuncture at Baihui (GV 20), Fengfu (GV 16), Shenting (GV 24) and Yintang (GV 29), etc. was used in the group B; oral administration of estazolam tablets (1 mg each-day) was adapted in the group C, all once a day for totally 30 days. The each item score and total score in Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) were evaluated before and after treatment in each group, also the efficacy in each group was assessed.After the treatment, the sleeping rate in the group A and B was significantly higher than that in the group C (both P < 0.05); the total effective rate in the Group A and B was also significantly higher than that in the group C [86.5% (45/52) and 82.7% (43/52) vs 63.5% (33/52), both P < 0.05; the total cured rate in the group A was significantly higher than those in the group B and C [48.1% (25/52) vs 23.1% (12/52) and 25.0% (13/52), both P < 0.05]. Each item score and total score of PSQI were all improved after treatment in the group A and B (P < 0.01, P < 0.05), while only sleeping time, sleeping efficiency and total score were improved in the group C (all P < 0.05). The sleeping quality, sleeping time, sleeping difficulty and daytime dysfunction in the group A were all lower than those in the group C (all P < 0.05). The sleeping quality, sleeping time and daytime dysfunction in the goup B were all lower than those in the group C (all P < 0.05). The total score in the group A was significantly lower than that in the group B and C (both P < 05).Acupuncture has better effect for menopausal insomnia than estazolam. Between the two acupuncture methods, the acupuncture method of smoothing-liver and regulating-spleen has a better effect.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335250","annotations":[{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.761432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.67571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.545987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.429997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.417895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.343838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.33047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.301499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.240868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0834668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Estazolam","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estazolam"},{"name":"Yintang","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yintang"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1252","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1252"},{"name":"1352","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1352"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"26th century","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/26th_century"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Social Democratic Party of Switzerland","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland"},{"name":"Ship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Pittsburgh","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh"}]}
