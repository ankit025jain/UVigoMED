{"id":45319,"title":"Cytotoxic effects of four aescin types on human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines.","abstract":"Four types of aescin that are available on the pharmaceutical market, beta-aescin crystalline, beta-aescin amorphous, beta-aescin sodium and aescin polysulfate, have been analyzed for their cytotoxic effects on human colon adenocarcinoma (LoVo) and doxorubicin-resistant human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (LoVo/Dx). Their cytotoxic activities were evaluated by sulforhodamine B (SRB) and methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assays. All four types of aescin exerted strong dose-dependent cytotoxicity to LoVo and, to a lesser degree, LoVo/Dx cell lines. The IC50 value for the LoVo/Dx cell line was higher, but still dose-dependent. Results from both assays demonstrated that p-aescin crystalline has the most cytotoxic activity toward human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24689224","annotations":[{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.739164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.627397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.207234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.202918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Amorphous solid","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_solid"},{"name":"Crystallinity","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallinity"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"}]}
