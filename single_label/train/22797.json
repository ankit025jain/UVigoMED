{"id":22797,"title":"Normal behavior of plasma procalcitonin in adolescents undergoing surgery for scoliosis.","abstract":"Surgical site infections are relatively common after spinal deformity surgery. Early detection of deep wound infections is important, since it may allow retention of spinal instrumentation. However, serum C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate may remain elevated for almost 6 weeks, making differential diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response and acute deep bacterial wound infection difficult. Plasma procalcitonin has been suggested to be a useful indicator for bacterial infection. However, there are no studies evaluating behavior of procalcitonin in patients undergoing major spine surgery with instrumentation.A total of 50 consecutive adolescents (37 idiopathic scoliosis and 13 neuromuscular scoliosis, mean age = 15 years at surgery and follow-up time = 21 months (range = 12-29 months)) undergoing scoliosis surgery participated in this prospective follow-up study. White blood cell count, serum C-reactive protein, and plasma procalcitonin levels were measured on the day before surgery, on the day of surgery, and daily thereafter for 1 week. None of the patients developed signs of acute or delayed wound infection during the follow-up period; however, two neuromuscular scoliosis patients developed severe postoperative pneumonia, and their inflammatory parameter data will be reported separately.Plasma procalcitonin levels peaked on the first postoperative day (mean = 0.19 ng/mL, range = 0.04-1.29 ng/mL), and mean values were less than 0.5 ng/mL during the whole first postoperative week, while C-reactive protein remained elevated during the whole first postoperative week (highest mean value = 63.8 mg/L (range = 5-248 mg/L) on third postoperative day). Patients with idiopathic scoliosis had lower C-reactive protein levels (p < 0.05 from first to sixth postoperative day) and lower procalcitonin levels (p < 0.05 from third to seventh postoperative day) than neuromuscular scoliosis patients. Two patients with postoperative pneumonia showed elevated procalcitonin values over the whole postoperative week (22.34 ng/mL and 0.72 ng/mL highest values, respectively).Elevated plasma procalcitonin levels seem useful when excluding acute deep wound infection from systemic inflammatory response.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520101","annotations":[{"name":"Scoliosis","weight":0.922386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.870536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.60633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.558217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"White blood cell count","weight":0.534719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell_count"},{"name":"Systemic inflammatory response syndrome","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.485583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.451808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.356173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.148263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Kyphosis","weight":0.112558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyphosis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"}]}
