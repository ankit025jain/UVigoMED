{"id":50899,"title":"Elevated serum free light chains predict cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"Elevated polyclonal serum immunoglobulin free light chains (FLCs; combined FLC?+FLC? [cFLC]) are associated with adverse clinical outcomes and increased mortality; we investigated cFLC and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in type 2 diabetes.In a cohort study of 352 south Asian patients with type 2 diabetes, serum cFLC, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and standard biochemistry were measured. CVD events over 2 years were recorded and assessed using multiple logistic regression.cFLC levels were elevated significantly in 29 of 352 (8%) patients with CVD events during 2 years of follow-up (50.7 vs. 42.8 mg/L; P = 0.004). In multivariate analysis, elevated cFLC (>57.2 mg/L) was associated with CVD outcomes (odds ratio 3.3 [95% CI 1.3-8.2]; P = 0.012) and remained significant after adjusting for age, albumin-to-creatinine ratio, diabetes duration, or treatment.cFLC elevation is a novel marker for CVD outcomes in type 2 diabetes that warrants further investigation.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742658","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.837917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.793617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.747661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.746945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.695711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.675867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.429557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.319691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.118004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0460588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.044683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Polyclonal antibodies","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"South Asia","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Side chain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_chain"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
