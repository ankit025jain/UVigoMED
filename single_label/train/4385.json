{"id":4385,"title":"[Nursing of advanced schistosomiasis patients: a report of 52 cases].","abstract":"To explore the reasonable nursing interventions of advanced schistosomiasis patients.The medical records of 52 advanced schistosomiasis patients hospitalized from 2008 to 2013 were collected, and the nursing interventions were summarized.The 52 cases of advanced schistosomiasis included 38 men and 14 women, with a mean age of 65.8 years (57-75 years). Totally 53.8% of the subjects were schistosome positive by IHA test, 67.3% positive by ELISA, and 21.2% positive of HBsAg. There were 13 cases of ascites type, 34 cases of megalosplenia type, and 5 cases of dwarfism type of advanced schistosomiasis. Following the therapy together with nursing interventions, 73.1% achieved clinical cure, 23.1% achieved stable, and 3.8% achieved improvement. The major nursing interventions involved basic nursing, diet nursing, treatment nursing, physiological nursing and surgical nursing.The scientific and reasonable nursing interventions can improve the therapeutic efficacy and prognosis in advanced schistosomiasis patients, as well as improve their quality of life.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345173","annotations":[{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.870581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.739852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.483733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.370556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Dwarfism","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarfism"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
