{"id":31714,"title":"Proteomic revelations.","abstract":"The power of proteomics in cultured skin fibroblasts from individuals with either systemic sclerosis or recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa has led to the common finding of senescence and deficiencies in autophagy. Both of these disorders exert high demand on fibroblast activity, and without the protective action of autophagy cellular stress could have many adverse effects that are further amplified by the senescent phenotype.
