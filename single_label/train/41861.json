{"id":41861,"title":"Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 as possible prognostic markers of the efficacy of antiviral treatment in chronic hepatitis C.","abstract":"Antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin had been proved to be effective in Hepatitis C treatment. However, the valuable markers for monitoring the efficacy of antiviral therapy are required clinically. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between pretreatment levels of Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels (MCP-1) and the virological response in treated patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.Concentrations of MCP-1 in serum were determined in 165 patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) treated with interferon and ribavirin by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay before and 48 weeks after cessation of therapy.Pretreatment MCP-1 levels in patients with sustained virological response (SVR) were significantly lower than in non-responders (Non-SVR) (220.2 +/- 31.7 vs. 305.6 +/- 50.7 pg/mL, p = 0.009) and MCP-1 significantly decreased in patients with SVR (form 220.2 +/- 31.7 pg/mL to 140.2 +/- 26.7 pg/mL; p <0.01) but not in Non-SVR (form 305.6 +/- 50.7 pg/mL to 286.6 +/- 41.9 pg/mL; p = 0.17) after 48 weeks of treatment. By multivariate analysis, non-1 genotype was independent predictors of SVR in all patients. When multivariate analysis was restricted to patients with non-1 genotype, only pretreatment MCP-1 levels were identified as predictive factors of SVR.MCP-1 may be a prognostic marker of the efficacy of antiviral therapy in CHC patients.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24895793","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.703062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.509335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.375736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"CCL2","weight":0.273267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCL2"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
