{"id":90573,"title":"Virtual plate pre-bending for the long bone fracture based on axis pre-alignment.","abstract":"In this paper, a modeling and visualizing system for assisting surgeons in correctly registering for the closed fracture reduction surgery is presented. By using this system, the geometric parameters of the target fixation plate before the long bone fracture operation can be obtained. The main processing scheme consists of following steps: firstly (image data process), utilize the Curvelet transform to denoise the CT images of fracture part and then reconstruct the 3D models of the broken bones. Secondly (pre-alignment), extract the axial lines of the broken bones and spatially align them. Then drive the broken bone models to be pre-aligned. Thirdly (mesh segmentation), a method based on vertex normal feature is utilized to obtain the broken bone cross-sections mesh models. Fourthly (fine registration), the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm is used to register the cross-sections and the broken bone models are driven to achieve the fine registration posture. Lastly (plate fitting), an accurate NURBS surface fitting method is used to construct the virtual plate. The experiment proved that the obtained models of the pre-bended plates were closely bonded to the surface of the registered long bone models. Finally, the lengths, angles and other interested geometric parameters can be measured on the plate models.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Wounds and
