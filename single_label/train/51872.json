{"id":51872,"title":"Importance of promoter methylation of GATA4 and TP53 genes in endometrioid carcinoma of endometrium.","abstract":"Epigenetic changes are considered to be a frequent event during tumor development. Various methylation changes have been identified and show promise as potential cancer biomarkers. The aim of this study was to investigate promoter methylation of GATA4 and TP53 genes in endometrioid carcinoma of endometrium.To search for promoter methylation of GATA4 and TP53 genes we used methylation-specific PCR (MSP) to compare the methylation status of 54 patients with endometrioid carcinoma of endometrium and 18 patients with normal endometrial tissue.In our study MSP revealed GATA4 promoter methylation in 44 of 54 in the carcinoma group (81.5%), and in none of the control group. No methylation was observed in TP53 gene.In conclusion, our study showed that there is significantly higher methylation in GATA4 gene in the endometrial cancer group compared with samples of non-neoplastic endometrium. The finding suggests the importance of hypermethylation of this gene in endometrial carcinogenesis and could have implications for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for endometrial cancer based on epigenetic changes.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651021","annotations":[{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.88077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.758285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.368227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.272203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Endometrioid tumor","weight":0.0504415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrioid_tumor"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"}]}
