{"id":87110,"title":"HIV self-testing among online MSM in China: implications for expanding HIV testing among key populations.","abstract":"HIV self-testing offers an alternative to facility-based testing that could expand HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM). We organized an online survey of MSM in China to better understand the frequency and correlates of HIV self-testing. A total of 1342 individuals completed the survey. About 20.3% of MSM reported previous HIV self-testing. Self-testing was correlated with being married, having 6 or greater male anal sex partners in the past 3 months, and having HIV tested within 12 months in the multivariable analysis. Our study suggests that HIV self-testing may be able to reach subgroups of high-risk MSM and enable more frequent HIV testing.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24991972","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Anal sex","weight":0.824471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex"},{"name":"China","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Sexual partner","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_partner"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.411544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.201356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.195212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Men who have sex with men","weight":0.184485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"1342","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1342"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Paid survey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_survey"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"}]}
