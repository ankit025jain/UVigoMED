Most quality measures are process measures. Application of these improves quality. Many national organizations are promoting them for purposes ranging from feedback to providers to public reporting and directing payment. Surgeons should evaluate their own practices and should be involved in local, regional and national efforts to assess and improve breast care.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25164555","annotations":[{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.361872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.0628012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Theatre director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_director"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Payment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"}]}
