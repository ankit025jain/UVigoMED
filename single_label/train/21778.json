{"id":21778,"title":"Frequency of vital signs monitoring and its association with mortality among adults with severe sepsis admitted to a general medical ward in Uganda.","abstract":"Optimal vital signs monitoring of patients with severe sepsis in resource-limited settings may improve outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of vital signs monitoring of patients with severe sepsis and its association with mortality in a regional referral hospital in Uganda.We reviewed medical records of patients admitted to Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital in Southwestern Uganda with severe sepsis defined by the presence of infection plus ? 2 of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, and ? 1 organ dysfunction (altered mental state, hypotension, jaundice, or thrombocytopenia). We recorded frequency of vital signs monitoring in addition to socio-demographic, clinical, and outcome data. We analyzed the data using logistic regression.We identified 202 patients with severe sepsis. The median age was 35 years (IQR, 25-47) and 98 (48%) were female. HIV infection and anemia was present in 115 (57%) and 83 (41%) patients respectively. There were 67 (33%) in-hospital deaths. The median monitoring frequency per day was 1.1 (IQR 0.9-1.5) for blood pressure, 1.0 (IQR, 0.8-1.3) for temperature and pulse, and 0.5 (IQR, 0.3-1.0) for respiratory rate. The frequency of vital signs monitoring decreased during the course of hospitalization. Patients who died had a higher frequency of vital signs monitoring (p<0.05). The admission respiratory rate was associated with both frequency of monitoring (coefficient of linear regression 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.8, p<0.001) and mortality (AOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-5.3, p = 0.01). Other predictors of mortality included severity of illness, HIV infection, and anemia (p<0.05).More research is needed to determine the optimal frequency of vital signs monitoring for severely septic patients in resource-limited settings such as Uganda.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
