{"id":84387,"title":"[Comparison of efficacy on functional constipation treated with electroacupuncture of different acupoint prescriptions: a randomized controlled pilot trial].","abstract":"To evaluate preliminarily the efficacy on functional constipation treated with electroacupuncture of different acupoint prescriptions.One hundred and four patients were randomized into a front-mu and back-shu points group (19 cases), a he-sea points group (34 cases), a he-sea, front-mu and back-shu points group (26 cases) and a western medication control group (25 cases). In the front-mu and back-shu points group, electroacupuncture was applied at bilateral Tianshu (ST 25) and Dachangshu (BL 25). In the he-sea points group, electroacupuncture was applied at bilateral Quchi (LI 11) and Shangjuxu (ST 37). In the he-sea, front-mu and back-shu points group, electroacupuncture was applied at unilateral Tianshu (ST 25), Dachangshu (BL 25), Quchi (LI 11) and Shangjuxu (ST 37). In the three groups above, the treatment was given 5 times a week in the first two weeks and 3 times a week in the next two weeks. In the western medication control group, mosapride citrate tablets were prescribed for oral administration, 1 table (5 mg) each time, 3 times a day, continuously for 4 weeks. The period of research was 9 weeks, including 1 week for baseline evaluation, 4 weeks for treatment and 4 weeks for follow-up. The weekly defecation frequency was taken as primary index, while the defecation difficulty and life quality score were taken as the secondary indices for the efficacy evaluation after treatment and in follow-up.According to the intention-to-treat (ITT) analytic principle, 104 cases were all enrolled in the final analysis. (1) After treatment, the weekly frequency of defecation was all increased significantly in the four groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The efficacy of the three electroacupuncture groups was similar to that of western medication control group (P > 0.05). In follow-up, the increasing effect on the weekly frequency of defecation was maintained in the he-sea points group (P < 0.01), superior to the front-mu and back-shu points group and the western medication control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01); the weekly frequency of defecation was not improved in the rest three groups (P > 0.05). (2) After treatment, defecation difficulty was relieved in the he-sea points group, the he-sea, front-mu and back-shu points group and the western medication control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). In follow-up, the improvements were still significant in the he-sea points group and the he-sea, front-mu and back-shu points group (both P < 0.01). (3) After treatment, the life quality score was significantly improved in the patients of the he-sea points group (P < 0.05). The difference was not significant in the rest three groups as compared with that before treatment (all P > 0.05).The weekly frequency of defecation is increased effectively after treatment in the three electroacupuncture groups and the efficacy is similar to mosapride citrate tablets. The bilateral Quchi (LI 11) and Shangjuxu (ST 37) in he-sea acupoints increase significantly the weekly frequency of defecation, relieve defecation difficulty and improve life quality. Acupuncture efficacy is sustained for 4 weeks. This acupoints prescription is the best in the treatment of functional constipation.","date":"2014-08-12","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25112080","annotations":[{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.66257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.608569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.476903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.30477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.172304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Electroacupuncture","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroacupuncture"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Functional constipation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_constipation"},{"name":"Mosapride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosapride"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Liberal International","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_International"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"British Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Library"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Western culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture"},{"name":"Citrate","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrate"},{"name":"Individual time trial","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_time_trial"}]}
