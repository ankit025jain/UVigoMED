{"id":65979,"title":"Clinical pharmacology and regulatory consequences of GnRH analogues in prostate cancer.","abstract":"GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) analogues are long-term known to be safe and effective in the clinical management of hormone-dependent advanced prostate cancer. However, their unusual mechanism of action of de-sensitizing pituitary receptors makes generic market entry challenging. In addition, safety aspects like initial flare-up, breakthrough escape, and miniflares render planning and organization of clinical registration trials a complex project.Regulatory requirements are high as these medicines are compared to bilateral surgical castration with a 100% success rate. GnRH analogues will be used probably even wider in the near future due to demographic development and extension of indications. However, they are challenged by their antagonistic counterparts, which are avoiding flare-up phenomena. The following article deals with regulatory requirements of GnRH analogues in regard to their clinical characteristics.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756149","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.675795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Castration","weight":0.662401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Clinical pharmacology","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_pharmacology"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.302395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.183005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.156765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.133777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.0556288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Generic drug","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_drug"},{"name":"Inguinal orchiectomy","weight":0.0288827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_orchiectomy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0214799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Rendering (computer graphics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Cat allergy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_allergy"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"},{"name":"Market entry strategy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_entry_strategy"}]}
