{"id":80468,"title":"The use of a heterogeneously controlled mouse population reveals a significant correlation of acute phase parasitemia with mortality in Chagas disease.","abstract":"Chagas disease develops upon infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and undergoes an acute phase characterized by massive parasite replication and the presence of parasites in the blood. This condition is known as acute phase parasitemia. This initial stage may result in a cure, in the development of the chronic stages of the disease or in the death of the infected host. Despite intensive investigation related to the characterization of the acute and chronic phases of the disease, the cause-effect relationship of acute phase parasitemia to the outcome of the disease is still poorly understood. In this study, we artificially generated a heterogeneously controlled mouse population by intercrossing F1 mice obtained from a parental breeding of highly susceptible A/J with highly resistant C57BL/6 mouse strains. This F2 population was infected and used to assess the correlation of acute phase parasitemia with the longevity of the animals. We used nonparametric statistical analyses and found a significant association between parasitemia and mortality. If males and females were evaluated separately, we found that the former were more susceptible to death, although parasitemia was similar in males and females. In females, we found a strong negative correlation between parasitemia and longevity. In males, however, additional factors independent of parasitemia may favor mouse mortality during the development of the disease. The correlations of acute phase parasitemia with mortality reported in this study may facilitate an appropriate prognostic approach to the disease in humans. Moreover, these results illustrate the complexity of the mammalian genetic traits that regulate host resistance during Chagas disease.
