{"id":11587,"title":"Intracerebral administration of ultrasound-induced dissolution of lipid-coated GDNF microbubbles provides neuroprotection in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.","abstract":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Neurotrophic factors, such as glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), have been shown to provide a neuroprotective effect in PD rats. We have previously reported that ultrasound-induced lipid-coated GDNF microspheres, which release GDNF in a sustained manner after low frequency ultrasound stimulation, can reduce hypoxic-ischemic injury in neonatal rats. In the present study, we investigated whether lipid-coated GDNF microspheres can provide a neuroprotective effect in a rat model of PD. After a rat model of PD was produced by 6-hydroxydompamine (6-OHDA) injections, lipid-coated GDNF microspheres (1.5mg/kg) were injected into the striatum of PD rats. We found that GDNF levels were increased in the striatum of PD rats after lipid-coated GDNF microspheres administration following low frequency ultrasound stimulation (20kHz, 5min per day, daily for 4 weeks). Moreover, GDNF microspheres reduced apomorphine-induced rotations, and increased striatal dopamine and nigral tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels in PD rats. Additionally, GDNF microspheres reduced caspase-3, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and OX-6 levels induced by 6-OHDA injections in PD rats. These data indicated that lipid-coated GDNF microspheres can provide a neuroprotective effect in PD rats.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583079","annotations":[{"name":"Tyrosine hydroxylase","weight":0.883733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_hydroxylase"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.879262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Neuroglia","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroglia"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Substantia nigra","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantia_nigra"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.865113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.810215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.76252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor","weight":0.707482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glial_cell_line-derived_neurotrophic_factor"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.705324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.631519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.604378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.484501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.406998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Neurotrophin","weight":0.36606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotrophin"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.125212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Hydroxylation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylation"},{"name":"Neurotrophic factors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotrophic_factors"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
