{"id":13350,"title":"[Preliminary study of establishing and assessing IBS-D model rats of gan stagnation and Pi deficiency syndrome].","abstract":"To establish a new disease-syndrome-symptom integrated diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) rat model of Gan stagnation and Pi deficiency syndrome (GSPDS).(1) The model establishment method: We combined mother-infant separation, chronic restraint, and senna gavage to establish a new IBS-D model of GSPDS. Totally 48 experimental rats were divided into the normal group (Group A), the mother-infant separation group (Group B), the chronic restraint group (Group C), and the senna gavage group (Group D), the mother-infant separation + senna gavage group (Group E), and the mother-infant separation + chronic restraint + senna gavage group (Group F), 8 in each group. (2) The model evaluation method: We used pain threshold indicating colorectal distension to represent for the visceral sensitivity, thus evaluating the establishment of \"disease\" model; open field test and serum D-xylose levels to evaluate the establishment of GSPDS model; defecation numbers of grain and loose stool rate to evaluate the establishment of diarrhea symptom.(1) Compared with Group A, the body weight gained less in Group F, showing statistical difference (P < 0.05). (2) The pain threshold significantly decreased in Group F, showing statistical difference when compared with Group A (P < 0.05). (3) Compared with Group A, the total cross number, the standing number, and the decoration number in Group F significantly decreased (P < 0.05). (4) Compared with Group A, the serum D-xylose level of Group F significantly decreased (P < 0.05). (5) Compared with Group A, the defecation numbers of grain and the loose stool rate significantly increased, showing statistical difference (P < 0.05).A new disease-syndrome-symptom integrated IBS-D animal model of GSPDS successfully established might be a better animal model used for studying IBS by Chinese medicine. However, further studies are needed.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483112","annotations":[{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.827475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.815177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.717758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.715845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.68328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.634747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.517554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.514899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.476365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.409824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"China","weight":0.284049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.260845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Cereal","weight":0.215315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.159322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Senna (plant)","weight":0.119278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senna_(plant)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mac OS X","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X"},{"name":"Threshold of pain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_pain"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Beauty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Disease model of addiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_model_of_addiction"},{"name":"Live fire exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_fire_exercise"},{"name":"Abdominal distension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_distension"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Open field system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_field_system"},{"name":"Self control","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_control"}]}
