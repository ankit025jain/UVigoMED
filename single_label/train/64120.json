{"id":64120,"title":"Investigation of allergenicity of some cosmetic mixtures by using ex vivo local lymph node assay-BrdU endpoints.","abstract":"Balsam of Peru and fragrance mix are commonly used in cosmetic products. Allergy to fragrance is the most common cause of cosmetic contact dermatitis.In the present study, ex vivo local lymph node assay-5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (LLNA-BrdU) was used to evaluate the dermal sensitization potential of these cosmetic mixtures. The stimulation index values and estimated concentration (EC3) values were calculated and the potency classification was found for each mixture. At the same time, in order to measure the irritant effect without having to use additional animals, a combination of ex vivo LLNA-BrdU and the irritancy assay was conducted.Th1 [interleukin (IL)-2, interferon-?] and Th2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-5) releases from lymph node cell culture were investigated as non-radioactive endpoints. According to the results of ex vivo LLNA-BrdU assays, EC3 values were found to be 3.09% (moderate) for balsam of Peru and 4.44% (moderate) for fragrance mix. Cytokine analysis results indicate that both Th1 and Th2 cytokines are involved in the regulation of murine contact allergy and can be considered as useful endpoints.In conclusion, according to our results, fragrance mix and balsam of Peru can be considered as moderate sensitizers; however, in high concentrations, both of them have irritation properties. The cytokines investigated can be considered as the endpoints of the ex vivo LLNA-BrdU assay.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25247696","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.828879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Contact dermatitis","weight":0.750443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.647868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.637993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Myroxylon","weight":0.541968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myroxylon"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.364907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.152748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Peru","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Aroma compound","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroma_compound"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"European Commission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
