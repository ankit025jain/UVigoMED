{"id":72060,"title":"Guidelines on genetic evaluation and management of Lynch syndrome: a consensus statement by the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer.","abstract":"The Multi-Society Task Force, in collaboration with invited experts, developed guidelines to assist health care providers with the appropriate provision of genetic testing and management of patients at risk for and affected with Lynch syndrome as follows: provides a colorectal cancer risk assessment tool to screen individuals in the office or endoscopy setting; illustrates a strategy for universal screening for Lynch syndrome by tumor testing of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer; -6 provide algorithms for genetic evaluation of affected and at-risk family members of pedigrees with Lynch syndrome; provides guidelines for screening at-risk and affected persons with Lynch syndrome; and lists the guidelines for the management of patients with Lynch syndrome. A detailed explanation of Lynch syndrome and the methodology utilized to derive these guidelines, as well as an explanation of, and supporting literature for, these guidelines are provided.
