{"id":46454,"title":"Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein-2A alters mitochondrial dynamics promoting cellular migration mediated by Notch signaling pathway.","abstract":"Recently, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells have been linked with dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics. Mitochondria are essential cellular organelles that undergo continuous dynamic cycles of fission and fusion. It has been proposed that a delicate balance between these two processes is important for many pathophysiological outcomes including cancer. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gamma herpesvirus that is associated with various lymphoid and epithelial malignancies. The viral latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) has been shown to increase the invasive ability and induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Our present study reveals that mitochondrial dynamics also plays a critical role in Epstein-Barr virus-associated epithelial cancers. Our data indicate that viral LMP2A causes an elevated mitochondrial fission in gastric and breast cancer cells, which is manifested by elevated fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Furthermore, LMP2A-mediated Notch pathway is responsible for this enhanced fission since inhibitors of the pathway decrease the expression of Drp1.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632494","annotations":[{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.904326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma","weight":0.853246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasopharyngeal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Organelle","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Membrane protein","weight":0.724129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_protein"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.723117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.716131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.708277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.584906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.474803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.421392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.401326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Notch signaling pathway","weight":0.367177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notch_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.323049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Nuclear fission","weight":0.0252209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Continuum (theory)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(theory)"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"}]}
