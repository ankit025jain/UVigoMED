{"id":82974,"title":"Role of vacuolar ATPase and Skp1 in Sjögren's syndrome.","abstract":"Immune mechanisms alone cannot directly account for exocrine gland dysfunction and extraglandular features such as renal tubular acidosis, neuropathy, hearing loss and fatigue in Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Absence of Vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) has been reported in SS related renal tubular acidosis (RTA). We hypothesise how defect in V-ATPase could account for decreased neurotransmitter release leading onto exocrine dysfunction, neuroendocrine manifestations and hearing loss which are well described manifestations in SS. S-phase-kinase-associated protein-1 (Skp1) is a constituent of RAVE which is involved in V-ATPase assembly. It is also a component of SCF ligase which is crucial in NF?B signalling. SKP1 also interacts with TRIM 21/Ro 52 which is an autoantigen in SS. By virtue of these interactions, we postulate how a defective skp1 could fit into the existing pathogenesis of SS and also account for increased risk of lymphoma in SS as well as congenital heart block in fetus of mothers with SS.
