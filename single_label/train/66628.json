{"id":66628,"title":"Dermatoglyphic pattern in male infertility.","abstract":"Dermatoglyphics in infertile male patients were studied and compared with that of age matched controls to see whether any specific dermatoglyphic pattern exists in infertile male patients. Infertile male patients with abnormal semen profile were referred to Cytogenetic Laboratory for karyotyping. We selected twenty-four infertile male patients with abnormal semen profile. Out of twenty-four infertile male patients, nineteen were with normal Karyotype and five patients were with abnormal Karyotype. Loop was the commonest pattern observed in the infertile male patients. All these fingertip and palmar dermatoglyphic findings were compared with that of result on finger and palmar dermatoglyphics of equal number of age matched controls. Statistical evaluation was done with software \"EPI- info, version-6.04 d\". Infertile males had reduced number of loops as compared to that of controls which was statistically significant. Total whorls were increased in infertile male patients as compared to that of controls which was statistically insignificant. Percentage of true palmar pattern in I 3 and I 4 areas was reduced in infertile male patients as compared to that of controls which was statistically insignificant.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696927","annotations":[{"name":"Semen","weight":0.462258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Whorl (mollusc)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whorl_(mollusc)"},{"name":"Dermatoglyphics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatoglyphics"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Chicago Loop","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop"},{"name":"Loop (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(music)"},{"name":"Epitaxy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitaxy"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"}]}
