{"id":43559,"title":"Liver transplantation of hepatitis B surface antigen positive donors to hepatitis B core antibody recipients: analysis of 27 patients.","abstract":"Shortage of donor livers is the major limiting factor for liver transplantation (LT). While livers from patients with past infection of Hepatitis-B (HBcAb+) are commonly used as donors, scant data exists on outcomes following transplantation of HBsAg+ donor livers. The impact of donor HBsAg positivity on recipient survival is currently analyzed.Post hoc analysis of all adults undergoing LT from October 1987-September 2010 registered in United Network for Organ Sharing/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, a concurrent, limited access database of all American LT recipients. Only recipients who were HBcAb+ were analyzed. LTs with missing donor or recipient serologic parameters for Hepatitis-B were excluded. Significant predictors of survival were determined by univariate analysis. Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine independent risk predictors in the multivariate analysis.The population consisted of 13,329 LT recipients. The mean age of donors and recipients were 40±16 years and 52±9 years respectively. The mean follow-up was 3.7 years. Study population included 27 recipients transplanted with HBsAg+ grafts, of whom 7 (28%) died. Outcomes were adjusted for donor age, recipient age, donor gender, recipient gender, type of LT, MELD score, HCV status, previous LT, and cold ischemic time. On multivariate analysis, LT recipient outcomes were not significantly different for HBsAg+ donors versus donors without prior hepatitis B infection (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.93-1.39, P=0.17). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed no significant survival difference between the two groups.These results suggest that donor HBsAg positivity did not affect overall survival of LT recipients. These findings could potentially expand the pool of liver donors.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System
