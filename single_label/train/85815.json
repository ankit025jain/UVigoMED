{"id":85815,"title":"Human herpesvirus 6 encephalitis simulating brain metastases in a patient with advanced small-cell lung cancer.","abstract":"The brain is a frequent site of metastases in small-cell lung cancer. Symptoms of cerebral involvement are headache, disorientation, nausea/vomiting and seizures.A man with small-cell lung cancer developed a human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) meningoencephalitis with neurological symptoms that simulated brain involvement from the lung cancer. HHV-6 is a T cell lymphotropic virus which may be pathogenic in the immunocompromised host. HHV-6 remains latent after the first infection, and when the immune system is compromised it can reactivate. The treatment of HHV-6 infection is highly specific and the drugs recommended are the two antivirals, ganciclovir or foscarnet.In cancer patients neurologic symptoms are usually due to brain metastases. This case shows that in a cancer patient any aspecific neurologic symptom should be carefully evaluated in order to exclude a non-oncologic cause. This statement is particularly true if the therapies for the oncological and neurological diseases are effective.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852190","annotations":[{"name":"Human herpesvirus 6","weight":0.905174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_herpesvirus_6"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.830605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Encephalitis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Meningoencephalitis","weight":0.754497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningoencephalitis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.749851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.517554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Brain metastasis","weight":0.378106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_metastasis"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.335266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Ganciclovir","weight":0.332141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganciclovir"},{"name":"Foscarnet","weight":0.154987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foscarnet"},{"name":"Disorientation","weight":0.132498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorientation"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"}]}
