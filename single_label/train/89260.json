{"id":89260,"title":"[Therapeutic guide to critical burn patients].","abstract":"Burn injuries are defined as the destruction of skin tissue under the effects of a thermal, electrical, chemical or radioactive agent. They can cause local injuries, with no systemic effect, but in certain cases, considered as \"critical burn patients\", they can produce severe and immediate systemic injuries, thus making it necessary to address care from a comprehensive perspective in order to achieve a satisfactory evolution. With this in mind, as nursing staff we must consider the need to review the treatments and nursing care we are applying to critical burn patients, in order to prevent the onset of complications that might lead to unwanted consequences or even the death of the patient, and eventually unifying criteria of nursing care. The main goal of this guide is to provide an efficient and easy to use working tool that is suitable for adult burn patients, thus making it easier for nurses to update knowledge and decision making.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738172","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.794893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.733029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.574321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.469809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.401196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.389507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.31447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.133777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Systems theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"}]}
