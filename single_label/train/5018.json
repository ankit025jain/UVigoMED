{"id":5018,"title":"[Analysis of immediate causes of mortality in the injured persons, suffering open hepatic injury on a prehospital stage].","abstract":"The results of a medical help delivery on prehospital stage to 200 injured persons, suffering penetrating abdominal wounding with hepatic damage, were analyzed. The main cause of death in 87.5% of the injured persons with open hepatic damage is a non-compensated blood loss, in 12.5%--traumatic shock and a prehospital stage duration. In accordance to data of the expert estimation, the anesthesiologic adequacy have constituted in the group of survivors--80.76%, and in those, who died--68.75%, confirming a very high level of the anesthesy adequacy. Level of adequacy of the blood loss compensation have constituted in group of survivors--57.69%, and in the group of patients, who died--37.50%, what could not be considered satisfactory. In patients--survivors a conditional adequacy of application of hemostatics have constituted 76%, and in a group of the injured persons, who have died--0.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417282","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.575717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.467703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.251242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.161238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Conditional probability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability"}]}
