{"id":43800,"title":"Panitumumab safety for treating colorectal cancer.","abstract":"Panitumumab is a human IgG2 mAb against the EGFR, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis. It has demonstrated clinical efficacy in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) in combination with chemotherapy in first- and second-line settings and as monotherapy in third-line setting. Recently, mutations in the RAS genes have been shown to be predictive of lack of efficacy, panitumumab should be restricted to patients with RAS wild-type (wt) tumors.This review focuses on main efficacy results of panitumumab in metastatic CRC in first-, second- and third-line settings in combination with chemotherapy or as monotherapy. Additionally, we have covered safety aspects of this agent in these indications, especially in K-RAS and all RAS wt patients. These safety aspects refer to the most common toxicities (i.e., acne-like skin rash, diarrhea and hypomagnesaemia).Panitumumab adds to the armamentarium of effective agents in the treatment of metastatic CRC. Due to its human origin, panitumumab is a well-tolerated agent with low rates of infusional reactions. Skin toxicity is frequent and should be pre-emptively treated. Other common toxicities related to panitumumab treatment, such as diarrhea and hypomagnesaemia, should be closely monitored to ensure early treatment or substitution.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766434","annotations":[{"name":"Panitumumab","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panitumumab"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"KRAS","weight":0.840988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.719076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.69103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.658052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.296728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.296149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.288061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"},{"name":"Hypomagnesemia","weight":0.132081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomagnesemia"},{"name":"Human evolution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Costa Rica","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
