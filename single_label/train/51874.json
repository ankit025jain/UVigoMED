{"id":51874,"title":"PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 decreases Mcl-1 expression and sensitizes ovarian carcinoma cells to Bcl-xL-targeting strategies, provided that Bim expression is induced.","abstract":"We previously showed that Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 cooperatively protect platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells from apoptosis. Here we assessed the anticancer potential of combining ABT-737-induced inhibition of Bcl-xL with Mcl-1 inhibition via PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway disruption using NVP-BEZ235. NVP-BEZ235 inhibited cell proliferation without inducing apoptosis. It strongly repressed Mcl-1 expression and induced Puma expression in both cell lines tested while differentially modulating Bim between the two. Interestingly, NVP-BEZ235 efficiently sensitized ovarian carcinoma cells to ABT-737, provided that Bim expression was induced. Moreover, inhibiting the ERK1/2 pathway restored Bim expression and sensitized low Bim-expressing cancer cells to the BEZ235/ABT-737 treatment.
