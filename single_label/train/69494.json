{"id":69494,"title":"Influence of free fatty acids on glucose uptake in prostate cancer cells.","abstract":"The study focuses on the interaction between glucose and free fatty acids (FFA) in malignant human prostate cancer cell lines by an in vitro observation of uptake of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and acetate.Human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, CWR22Rv1, LNCaP, and DU145) were incubated for 2 h and 24 h in glucose-containing (5.5 mM) Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with varying concentrations of the free fatty acid palmitate (0-1.0 mM). Then the cells were incubated with [(18)F]-FDG (1 ?Ci/mL; 0.037 MBq/mL) in DMEM either in presence or absence of glucose and in presence of varying concentrations of palmitate for 1 h. Standardized procedures regarding cell counting and measuring for (18)F radioactivity were applied. Cell uptake studies with (14)C-1-acetate under the same conditions were performed on PC3 cells.In glucose containing media there was significantly increased FDG uptake after 24 h incubation in all cell lines, except DU145, when upper physiological levels of palmitate were added. A 4-fold increase of FDG uptake in PC3 cells (15.11% vs. 3.94%/10(6) cells) was observed in media with 1.0 mM palmitate compared to media with no palmitate. The same tendency was observed in PC3 and CWR22Rv1 cells after 2 h incubation. In glucose-free media no significant differences in FDG uptake after 24 h incubation were observed. The significant differences after 2 h incubation all pointed in the direction of increased FDG uptake when palmitate was added. Acetate uptake in PC3 cells was significantly lower when palmitate was added in glucose-free DMEM. No clear tendency when comparing FDG or acetate uptake in the same media at different time points of incubation was observed.Our results indicate a FFA dependent metabolic boost/switch of glucose uptake in PCa, with patterns reflecting the true heterogeneity of the disease.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440212","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Palmitic acid","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitic_acid"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.68384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Fluorine","weight":0.561886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.553862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.492859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.484677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"DU145","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DU145"},{"name":"LNCaP","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNCaP"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.280046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.221426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"PC3","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC3"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.067811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Radiocarbon dating","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Free fatty acid","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_fatty_acid"},{"name":"Duke University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University"},{"name":"Glucose uptake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_uptake"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"}]}
