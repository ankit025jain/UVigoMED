{"id":51242,"title":"[Investigation of a rare supernumerary i(Y)(q10) chromosome in a patient with premature ovarian failure].","abstract":"To investigate the origin of a rare supernumerary chromosome in a patient with premature ovarian failure (POF), and to explore the relationship between this abnormal karyotype and pathogenesis of POF.GTG banding karyotyping, Q-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were employed for the investigation.The extra chromosome was identified as i(Y)(q10) by FISH with a panel of sex chromosome probes. The patient's karyotype was described as: 47,XX,+ ish mar i(Y)(q10) (DXZ1-, SRY-, DYZ3+, DYZ1++, wcpY+).Co-occurrence of the supernumerary i(Y)(q10) with a female kryotype is extremely rare. This supernumerary chromosome may cause failure of X chromosomes synapsis during pachytene of meiosis I, which may trigger apoptosis of many oocytes and result in POF of the patient. Q-banding, FISH and multiple probes have been critical for accurate diagnosis of the unknown chromosome.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24711030","annotations":[{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.904721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Synapsis","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapsis"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.884636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Meiosis","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis"},{"name":"Sex-determination system","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-determination_system"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.828565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.826984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"SRY","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRY"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.585576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.574226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.547123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.402309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.391104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.336682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.236682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"XY sex-determination system","weight":0.197191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.169228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Premature ovarian failure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ovarian_failure"},{"name":"Judaism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pakistan Ordnance Factories","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Ordnance_Factories"},{"name":"Trigger (firearms)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_(firearms)"},{"name":"Supernumerary","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernumerary"}]}
