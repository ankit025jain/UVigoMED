{"id":42940,"title":"Current diagnosis and management of simple hepatic cysts detected prenatally and postnatally.","abstract":"The optimal management of simple hepatic cysts (SHCs) remains controversial. A retrospective review was carried out to evaluate the clinical presentation and surgical consideration of children with SHCs and outcome of management at our institution.We performed a retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with SHCs between January 1993 and May 2013. Patient variables included prenatal findings, age, gender, presenting symptoms, signs and diagnostic modality. Operative management and nonoperative follow-up were abstracted.The 67 patients comprised 42 females and 25 males: 16 had prenatally detected, and 51 had postnatally detected hepatic cysts with a mean follow-up of 3.2 years (10 months-12 years). The average age was 5.9 years (0-17 years). Ten patients (six females and four males) were treated surgically. Fifty-seven asymptomatic patients were observed. Of those 57 patients, 9 (17%) had enlarged cysts, and 1 (2%) had clinical signs. The average enlargement time was 36 months (6-67 months). The cysts occurred in the right lobe in 47 patients, in the left lobe in 17 patients and in both lobes in 3 patients. The median cyst size for the asymptomatic cases was 2.1 cm (1.5-6 cm) and 13.7 cm (8-25 cm) for the surgery group. A statistically significant difference in cyst size was found between these two groups (p < 0.05). Prenatally detected cysts (n = 5) were subjected to surgery postnatally at an average age of 1.5 months (1 week-6 months). The main indication was the compressive effect of the cyst on the surrounding area. There was one case of hepatomegaly found to be causing pressure symptoms, two cases of respiratory distress, one case of hydroureteronephrosis, and one case of jaundice due to compression of the biliary system. Five patients underwent surgery in the postnatally detected group, and the main indication was a complication of the cyst or progressive enlargement. Symptoms included abdominal discomfort and pain in all five patients: one case exhibited a hemorrhage within the cyst, one case displayed a rupture with possible peritonitis, one case had a 25-cm cyst leading to secondary infection, and two cases were admitted with progressive enlargement with clinical symptoms.Conservative management of SHCs is practical. Surgical excision is recommended in patients with larger cysts, causing pressure symptoms, or if the cyst size does not seem to involute with intractable abdominal pain or becomes complicated in the follow-up period.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System
