{"id":55995,"title":"Displacement of optical centers in over-the-counter readers: a potential cause of diplopia.","abstract":"Induced prism in spectacle lenses, which may result from inadvertent displacement of optical centers, may worsen an existing heterophoria or even cause diplopia, yet over-the-counter reading glasses (OTC readers) are not always assessed by clinicians when evaluating patients with diplopia or asthenopia. To gauge the magnitude of this potential problem, we used a focimeter and prescription aligner to assess the frequency and extent of clinically significant manufacturing variations in a random selection of 160 OTC readers. The optical centers were vertically displaced by ?3 mm in 11%, with a maximum displacement of 7 mm in 1 pair. Average interpupillary distance was 64 mm (range, 58-74.5 mm), with interpupillary distance outside the normal range of 60-70 mm in 5%. Monocular pupillary distance was asymmetric by ?5 mm in 4%. A 0.75 D power difference between lenses was measured in one pair of OTC readers. Some OTC readers have misaligned optical centers and other manufacturing defects that are of a magnitude sufficient to exacerbate a heterophoria and cause asthenopia or diplopia.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767829","annotations":[{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Prism (optics)","weight":0.735633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(optics)"},{"name":"Glasses","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.634145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.403994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Monocular","weight":0.388927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocular"},{"name":"Diplopia","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia"},{"name":"Corrective lens","weight":0.240035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_lens"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Asthenopia","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthenopia"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Heterophoria","weight":0.053079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterophoria"},{"name":"Eyeglass prescription","weight":0.0369773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeglass_prescription"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Pupillary distance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupillary_distance"},{"name":"Interpupillary distance","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpupillary_distance"},{"name":"Crystallographic defect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_defect"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Variation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_(music)"},{"name":"Random sample","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Gauge (bore diameter)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_(bore_diameter)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Displacement (ship)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(ship)"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Over-the-counter drug","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"}]}
