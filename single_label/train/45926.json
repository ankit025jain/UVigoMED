{"id":45926,"title":"Induction of intrinsic apoptosis pathway in colon cancer HCT-116 cells by novel 2-substituted-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalene derivatives.","abstract":"2-Acetyl tetralin (1) reacted with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal (DMF-DMA) to afford the enaminone 3. The reaction of 3 with piperidine and morpholine afforded the trans enaminone 5a,b, respectively. Compound 3 was treated with primary aromatic amines to give secondary enaminones 6a-e. The enaminone 3 reacted with acetylglycine and hippuric acid to yield pyranones 10a, b, respectively. The reaction of enaminone 3 with 1,4-benzoquinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone gave benzofuranyl tetralin derivatives 14a,b, respectively. Also, when 3 reacted with 5-amino-3-phenyl-1H-pyrazole 15a and 5-amino-1,2,3-triazole 15b, it afforded the new pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine 17a and 1,2,3-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine 17b, respectively. While the reaction of 3 with pyrimidines 18a, b resulted in the formation of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives 20a, b, respectively. Investigations of the cytotoxic effect of those compounds against different human cell lines indicated that some compounds showed high selective cytotoxicity against colon cancer HCT-116 cells. Some of these compounds led to DNA damaging and fragmentation that was associated with the induction of apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway. This pathway is initiated by the impairment of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (??m) and in response to that the mitochondria released cytochrome c increased, that in turn activated caspase-9 and caspase-3 and induced apoptosis. Compounds 17b and 20b were promising anti-cancer agents that induced intrinsic apoptosis pathway in colon cancer cells.
