{"id":72174,"title":"A nomogram to predict loco-regional control after re-irradiation for head and neck cancer.","abstract":"Loco-regionally recurrent head and neck cancer (HNC) in the setting of prior radiotherapy carries significant morbidity and mortality. The role of re-irradiation (re-RT) remains unclear due to toxicity. We determined prognostic factors for loco-regional control (LRC) and formulated a nomogram to help clinicians select re-RT candidates.From July 1996 to April 2011, 257 patients with recurrent HNC underwent fractionated re-RT. Median prior dose was 65 Gy and median time between RT was 32.4 months. One hundred fifteen patients (44%) had salvage surgery and 172 (67%) received concurrent chemotherapy. Median re-RT dose was 59.4 Gy and 201 (78%) patients received IMRT. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards were used to identify independent predictors of LRC and a nomogram for 2-year LRC was constructed.Median follow-up was 32.6 months. Two-year LRC and overall survival (OS) were 47% and 43%, respectively. Recurrent stage (P=0.005), non-oral cavity subsite (P<0.001), absent organ dysfunction (P<0.001), salvage surgery (P<0.001), and dose >50 Gy (P=0.006) were independently associated with improved LRC. We generated a nomogram with concordance index of 0.68.Re-RT can be curative, and our nomogram can help determine a priori which patients may benefit.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993329","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.629306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.553323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","weight":0.479993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.47573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.397949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Nomogram","weight":0.309824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Higher National Certificate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_National_Certificate"},{"name":"A priori and a posteriori","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"257","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/257"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Recurrent neural network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"RT (TV network)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Proportional representation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"LRC (train)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(train)"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Concordance (genetics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(genetics)"}]}
