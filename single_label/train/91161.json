{"id":91161,"title":"Right pulmonary hilar pedicle injury secondary to blunt chest trauma in a child.","abstract":"Combined tracheobronchial and thoracic vascular injury in children following blunt trauma to the chest is potentially life-threatening and almost certain to be fatal unless managed promptly. We report one such incident where prompt identification and early aggressive surgical management prevented an almost certain fatal outcome in a 5-year-old girl with complete disruption of the right main bronchus just distal to the carina, and a tear in the right pulmonary artery.
