{"id":60470,"title":"Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis: update on diagnosis, clinical outcome, and counseling.","abstract":"Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a clonal B-cell disorder characterized by less than 5 × 109/L B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, with a characteristic immunophenotype and no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. The vast majority of MBL cases express the immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; CLL-like MBL), although non-CLL MBL also exists. CLL-like MBL, which is the focus of this review, is divided into low-count MBL (median B-cell count: 0.001 × 109/L, typically identified in population-based screening studies using highly sensitive flow cytometry assays) and high-count MBL (clinical MBL, median B-cell count: 2.9 × 109/L, typically identified during the workup of low-level lymphocytosis). Low-count MBL has an exceedingly small risk of progression to CLL, and these patients do not require any specific follow-up. In contrast, patients with high-count MBL have a 1% to 2% per year risk of progression to CLL requiring therapy, as well as a higher risk of infectious complications and secondary malignancies. Although the overall survival of high-count MBL patients collectively is similar to the age- and sex-matched general population, 5-year survival for high-count MBL with higher-risk biologic parameters appears to be slightly lower than that of the general population. This review summarizes key concepts in the classification, diagnosis, and biology of CLL-like MBL and addresses several important issues in clinical management.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896545","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.87818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.817416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Immunophenotyping","weight":0.744551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunophenotyping"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.718621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.645652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.627403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.504425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.449573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.420555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.409153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Biologic","weight":0.28582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologic"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.281082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.213635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Lymphocytosis","weight":0.197222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytosis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
