{"id":92040,"title":"Self-concept and self-esteem after acquired brain injury: a control group comparison.","abstract":"This study examined the multidimensional self-concept, global self-esteem and psychological adjustment of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) as compared with healthy controls.Group comparison on self-report questionnaires.Forty-one individuals who had sustained a TBI were compared with an age- and gender-matched sample of 41 trauma-free control participants on the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, the Tennessee Self Concept Scale (second edition) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS).Participants with TBI rated significantly lower mean levels of global self-esteem and self-concept on the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale and Tennessee Self Concept Scale than the control group. Survivors of TBI rated themselves more poorly on a range of self-dimensions, including social, family, academic/work and personal self-concept compared to controls. They also reported higher mean levels of depression and anxiety on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Overall self-concept was most strongly associated with depressive symptoms and anxiety.Self-concept may be lowered following TBI and is associated with negative emotional consequences. Clinicians may improve the emotional adjustment of survivors of TBI by considering particular dimensions of self-concept for intervention focus.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456054","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.844987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.843638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Self-esteem","weight":0.833809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.74653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.457256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.353658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tennessee","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Self","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
