{"id":77444,"title":"Assessing Hmong farmers' safety and health.","abstract":"This pilot project investigated agricultural-related safety and health issues among Hmong refugees working on family-operated farms. Novel approaches, namely participatory rural appraisal and photovoice, were used to conduct a qualitative occupational hazard assessment with a group of Hmong farmers in Washington State. These two methods were useful in gathering participants' own perspectives about priority concerns. Several identified problems were related to musculoskeletal disorders, handling and operating heavy machinery, heat and cold stress, respiratory exposures, pest management, and socioeconomic and language concerns. Findings from this study provide insight into the work-related challenges that Hmong refugee farmers encounter and can serve as a basis for occupational health professionals to develop interventions to assist this underserved group.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24806037","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.647062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.457191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.441499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Refugee","weight":0.373081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.311544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.254042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.181281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Pest (organism)","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism)"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.145327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Washington (state)","weight":0.116557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0898588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0506369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Pest control","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_control"},{"name":"Heavy equipment (construction)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_equipment_(construction)"},{"name":"Hmong people","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong_people"},{"name":"Participatory rural appraisal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_rural_appraisal"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal disorder","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Thermoreceptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoreceptor"},{"name":"Real estate appraisal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_appraisal"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Participation (decision making)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_(decision_making)"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
