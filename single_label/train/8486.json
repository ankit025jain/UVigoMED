{"id":8486,"title":"Hepatic magnetic resonance imaging with T2* mapping of ovariectomized rats: correlation between iron overload and postmenopausal osteoporosis.","abstract":"To explore the correlation between liver iron overload and bone mineral density (BMD) in an ovariectomy (OVX) rat model, using liver magnetic resonance (MR)-T2* and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).Sprague-Dawley rats received deferoxamine (DFO) or phosphate-buffered saline 3 months after bilateral OVX. MRI and DEXA were performed pre- and postoperatively. Five rats per group were killed every month for micro-CT, histopathology and biochemical examinations. Statistical analysis was performed with independent-samples t tests, box plots and Pearson's correlation analysis.At 2 months postoperatively, BMD was significantly lower in the OVX group than in the control group (P?<?0.01), corresponding to the increased serum ferritin concentration (SFC; P?<?0.01) and liver iron concentration (LIC; P?<?0.01). Liver T2* values significantly differed between the two groups at 1 month postoperatively (P?<?0.001) and improved 1 month after DFO injection (P?<?0.05). These values were significantly and positively correlated with BMD in the control (r?=?0.527, P?<?0.001) and OVX (r?=?0.456, P?<?0.001) groups.Liver MRI T2* changed markedly earlier than BMD, LIC and SFC, and correlated well with osteoporosis; it may thus be a valuable early indicator of osteoporosis.• Iron overload plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis. • Liver T2* relaxation time is a sensitive value in reflecting iron overload. • Liver T2* mapping elucidates changes in postmenopausal osteoporosis earlier than BMD. • Iron chelation increases BMD in ovariectomized rats. • Liver T2* has a moderate positive correlation with BMD.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770554","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Deferoxamine","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferoxamine"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.820698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Chelation","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.716577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.701877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.624215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.509903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry","weight":0.38435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.365612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Iron overload","weight":0.343838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_overload"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.240868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.238296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Oophorectomy","weight":0.148912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oophorectomy"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0978921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Relaxation technique","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_technique"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"}]}
