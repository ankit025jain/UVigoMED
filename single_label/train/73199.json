{"id":73199,"title":"[Determining the tumor-cell density required for macroscopic observation of 5-ALA-induced fluorescence of protoporphyrin IX in cultured glioma cells and clinical cases].","abstract":"We investigated the association between the cell density and intensity of 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced fluorescence of protoporphyrin IX in 3-dimensionally cultured C6 glioma cells. The ratio between 636-nm red fluorescence excited by a 405-nm laser and 513-nm green autofluorescence of the tissue was measured as the fluorescence intensity. A ratio exceeding 0.68 was macroscopically judged as fluorescence-positive by observers, and the cell density at this fluorescence intensity was 1Ã—107< cells/mL. In clinical surgical fields, the fluorescence ratio was about 0.65 in cases judged as fluorescence-positive, similarly to that in cultured cells. Neurosurgeons and pathologists should recognize that tumor cells are present in fluorescence-negative regions. It is necessary to develop a device which measures fluorescence more simply than macroscopic observation for cutting-edge brain surgery.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24920740","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.739275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.586928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.576847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.375381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.274482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.152005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0527294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Porphyrin","weight":0.0507772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyrin"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Autofluorescence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofluorescence"},{"name":"Protoporphyrin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoporphyrin"},{"name":"Dimensional analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"636","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/636"},{"name":"1107","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1107"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Factor IX","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_IX"}]}
