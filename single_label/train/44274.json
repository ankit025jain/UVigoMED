{"id":44274,"title":"[A case of para-aortic lymph node metastasis from colon cancer with complete response to uracil/tegafur plus leucovorin therapy].","abstract":"In October 2008, a 66-year-old male patient underwent resection of the right half of the colon for ascending colon cancer. Histopathological examination revealed a tumor classification of tub2, pSE, ly1, v0, PM0, DM0, RM0, pN1(2/23), H0 , P0 , Stage III a. The patient was treated with uracil/tegafur plus Leucovorin(UFT/LV)chemotherapy after surgery. However, he developed Grade 2 liver dysfunction after completion of 1 course, so UFT/LV was discontinued. In June 2009, a rise in the carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA)level was observed, and computed tomography(CT)and positron emission tomography with 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose(FDG-PET)showed a single enlarged lymph node, 2 cm in diameter, located around the aorta. We informed the patient of the therapeutic effect of anticancer drug treatment and surgery, risk of adverse events, and other management methods, and UFT/LV chemotherapy was selected as treatment. After 3 courses, the lymph node had completely disappeared, and UFT/LV was discontinued in April 2011, as there was no sign of recurrence. The patient remains alive and well. We report a case of para-aortic lymph node metastasis after surgery, treated with UFT/LV, which led to a complete response without major adverse events.
