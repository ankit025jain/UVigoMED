{"id":86966,"title":"Long-term study of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine.","abstract":"We present a long-term safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness study of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV4) vaccine.Sexually naive boys and girls aged 9 to 15 years (N = 1781) were assigned (2:1) to receive HPV4 vaccine or saline placebo at day 1 and months 2 and 6. At month 30, the placebo group (n = 482) received HPV4 vaccine following the same regimen and both cohorts were followed through month 96. Subjects ? 16 years were eligible for effectiveness evaluations. The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term anti-HPV6/11/16/18 serological levels. The secondary objective was to estimate vaccine effectiveness against HPV6/11/16/18-related persistent infection or disease.For each of the HPV4 vaccine types, vaccination-induced anti-HPV response persisted through month 96. Among 429 subjects who received HPV4 vaccine at a mean age of 12, none developed HPV6/11/16/18-related disease or persistent infection of ? 12 months' duration. Acquisition of new sexual partners (among those ? 16 years) was ?1 per year. Subjects receiving HPV4 vaccine at month 30 (mean age 15 years) had a similar baseline rate of seropositivity to ? 1 of the 4 HPV types to those vaccinated at day 1 (mean age 12 years; 1.9% [9 of 474] vs 1.7% [20 of 1157]); however, 4 of the 9 subjects vaccinated at the later age were seropositive to 3 vaccine types, indicating previous HPV exposure. No new significant serious adverse events were observed for 8 years postvaccination in both genders.When administered to adolescents, the HPV4 vaccine demonstrated durability in clinically effective protection and sustained antibody titers over 8 years.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25136050","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"HPV vaccine","weight":0.504453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV_vaccine"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.480937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.0438266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Sexual partner","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_partner"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1781","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1781"},{"name":"1157","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1157"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Basal metabolic rate","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
