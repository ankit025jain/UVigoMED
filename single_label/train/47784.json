{"id":47784,"title":"Core promoter: a critical region where the hepatitis B virus makes decisions.","abstract":"The core promoter (CP) of the viral genome plays an important role for hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication as it directs initiation of transcription for the synthesis of both the precore and pregenomic (pg) RNAs. The CP consists of the upper regulatory region and the basal core promoter (BCP). The CP overlaps with the 3'-end of the X open reading frames and the 5'-end of the precore region, and contains cis-acting elements that can independently direct transcription of the precore mRNA and pgRNA. Its transcription regulation is under strict control of viral and cellular factors. Even though this regulatory region exhibits high sequence conservation, when variations appear, they may contribute to the persistence of HBV within the host, leading to chronic infection and cirrhosis, and eventually, hepatocellular carcinoma. Among CP sequence variations, those occurring at BCP may dysregulate viral gene expression with emphasis in the hepatitis B e antigen, and contribute to disease progression. In this review these molecular aspects and pathologic topics of core promoter are deeply evaluated.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574711","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Conserved sequence","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.720601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.640761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Regulatory sequence","weight":0.590333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_sequence"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.432401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Transcriptional regulation","weight":0.387637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptional_regulation"},{"name":"Reading frame","weight":0.346949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_frame"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.260167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Ceruloplasmin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceruloplasmin"},{"name":"Persistent organic pollutant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"}]}
