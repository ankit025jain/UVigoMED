{"id":80350,"title":"Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes produce cytokines in response to Leishmania major promastigotes.","abstract":"Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) release cytokines that may influence the development of the subsequent adaptive immune response. Little is known about cytokines produced by human PMN in response to Leishmania (L.). In this study, mRNA expression of Interleukin (IL)-12p40, IL-12p35, Interferon (IFN)-?, transforming growth factor (TGF)-?, IL-1, and IL-4 in PMN of volunteers stimulated with L. major promastigotes has been investigated by real-time PCR and the results were confirmed by flow cytometer. The results showed that L. major did not induce mRNA expression of IL12p40, IL12p35, IFN-?, and TGF-? in PMN, while IL-1 and IL-4 mRNA were induced. Flow cytometry results confirmed no IFN-? production by PMN with or without stimulation. IL-12p70 was present in untreated and L. major-treated PMN, and these cells release IL-12 following incubation with L. major. Significant amount of IL-1 even without treatment with promastigotes was detected in PMN. Moreover, the proportion of PMN, which produce IL-1 in response to L. major, was increased compared with the percent of unstimulated IL-1-producing PMN. The results showed the accumulation of small amounts of IL-4 in PMN after stimulation. In conclusion, our results indicate that IL-12 and IL-1 are pre-stored in human PMN, nor L. major induces IL-1 and IL-4, but not IL-12, IFN-?, nor TGF-? expression in these cells.
