{"id":18576,"title":"[Murine typhus in a Japanese traveler returning from Indonesia: a case report].","abstract":"We report herein on a 20-year-old Japanese man who was referred to our hospital for fever and diarrhea after returning from Indonesia. On admission, his blood test was essentially normal, besides a slight elevation in inflammatory markers. After excluding malaria and dengue fever, empiric use of ceftriaxone was initiated for suspected enteric fever, which was unsuccessful. However, drastic clinical improvement was observed after initiation of minocycline. The polymerase chain reaction test for Rickettsia typhi was positive from serum samples on admission, confirming the diagnosis of murine typhus. Although rarely seen in Japan, clinicians should be aware of this disease when examining patients with fever coming back from murine typhus endemic areas.","date":"2014-05-01","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783459","annotations":[{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Typhus","weight":0.789136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Ceftriaxone","weight":0.784357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftriaxone"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Typhoid fever","weight":0.775064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Indonesia","weight":0.707151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.692299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Rickettsia","weight":0.573241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickettsia"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.458563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.416493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.414695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Minocycline","weight":0.348623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minocycline"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.206147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Murine typhus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murine_typhus"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
