{"id":22267,"title":"Diagnostic accuracy of presepsin (soluble CD14 subtype) for prediction of bacteremia in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the Emergency Department.","abstract":"Bacteremia is indicative of severe bacterial infection with significant mortality. Its early diagnosis is extremely important for implementation of antimicrobial therapy but a diagnostic challenge. Although blood culture is the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis of bacteremia this method has limited usefulness for the early detection of blood-stream infection. In this study we assessed the presepsin as predictor of bacteremia in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) on admission to the Emergency Department and compare it with current available infection biomarkers.A total of 226 patients admitted to the Emergency Department with SIRS were included. In 37 patients blood culture had a positive result (bacteremic SIRS group) and 189 had a negative blood culture result (non-bacteremic SIRS group). Simultaneously with blood culture, presepsin, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for each biomarker as predictor of bacteremia.Presepsin values were significantly higher in bacteremic SIRS group when compared with non-bacteremic SIRS group. ROC curve analysis and area under curve (AUC) revealed a value of 0.750 for presepsin in differentiating SIRS patients with bacteremia from those without, similar than that for PCT (0.787) and higher than that for CRP (0.602). The best cut-off value for presepsin was 729pg/mL, which was associated with a negative predictive value of 94.4%.Presepsin may contribute to rule out the diagnosis of bacteremia in SIRS patients admitted to the Emergency Department.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560955","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.704802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.610947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.567968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.560274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.551036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.522637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Systemic inflammatory response syndrome","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.284565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.228977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.176043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"CD14","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD14"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Porphyria cutanea tarda","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyria_cutanea_tarda"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
