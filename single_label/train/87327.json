{"id":87327,"title":"The incidence and pattern of maxillofacial injuries in helmeted versus non-helmeted motorcycle accident patients.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in incidence and pattern of bony and soft tissue injuries sustained by helmeted versus non-helmeted motorcycle accident patients.The medical records of motorcycle accident patients over a 10-year period were reviewed. Basic demographic data including age, gender, and Injury Severity Score (ISS) were collected. The patients were separated into 2 groups based on helmet use. For each group, the incidence of specific maxillofacial injuries (based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) was tallied. Statistical analysis was performed with the Fisher exact test.A total of 717 patients were included in the study: 598 patients (mean age, 41.6 years; male gender, 90.8%; ISS, 18.2) were in the helmeted group and 119 patients (mean age, 40.8 years; male gender, 90.8%; ISS, 19.5) were in the non-helmeted group. Among the helmeted riders, 26.1% (n=156) sustained a maxillofacial injury, and among the non-helmeted riders, 45.4% (n=54) sustained a maxillofacial injury (P=.0001). The non-helmeted riders also had a significantly higher incidence of malar and maxillary fractures (P=.040), orbital fractures (P=.044), and soft tissue contusions and abrasions (P=.031).The results of this study suggest that not only do helmets protect against facial injuries in totality, they appear to be more effective at preventing midfacial fractures when compared with mandible fractures.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25262400","annotations":[{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.922179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.636827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.587259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.497889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.44917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.437872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery","weight":0.408935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.331511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.223314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.22131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.213393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0972833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.0951027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Abrasion (medical)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasion_(medical)"},{"name":"Facial trauma","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_trauma"},{"name":"Soft tissue injury","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue_injury"},{"name":"Injury Severity Score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_Severity_Score"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Exact test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Grammatical gender","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender"},{"name":"International Space Station","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Helmet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet"},{"name":"Ronald Fisher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Motorcycle helmet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_helmet"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"},{"name":"Motorcycle","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle"}]}
