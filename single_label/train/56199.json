{"id":56199,"title":"\"Pushed\" stent intubation for treatment of complex congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.","abstract":"To assess the success rate of pushed stent intubation in children with complex congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO).This prospective study was performed in a single academic center. Forty-four eyes with complex CNLDO were treated with pushed stent intubation. Outcome measures included clinical signs plus a parental history of residual symptoms at 6 months after surgery. Relative risk with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for outcomes was reported.The mean follow-up after surgery was 9.0 months (range 6.5-13 months). Complete resolution was achieved in 26 of 44 eyes (59.1%; 95% CI 43.3%-73.3%) after pushed stent. Sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.9; 95% CI 0.4-18.9), age (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.5-1.5), previous history of probing (OR 1.1; 95% CI 0.1-8.1), and presence of mucopurulent discharge (OR 1.1; 95% CI 0.1-7.8) did not have significant impact on the failure rate in all subjects.In patients with complex CNLDO, treatment with a pushed stent intubation alleviated the clinical signs and symptoms of CNLDO. Pushed stent has the advantage of reduced operating time and easy placement.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24729146","annotations":[{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.595057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.533711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.386617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.350986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.190157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"Nasolacrimal duct","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasolacrimal_duct"},{"name":"Mucopurulent discharge","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucopurulent_discharge"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"Think tank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
