{"id":686,"title":"[Pseudomonas infection: biological risk by occupational exposure and results of an environmental monitoring].","abstract":"The biological risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for activities involving exposure to contaminated water, such as, for example, routine maintenance of swimming pools, is related to the availability of effective prophylactic and therapeutic measures. The authors present the data of the microbiological analyzes made on 2349 samples taken from pools in Rome and province. The contamination by Pseudomonas was found in 191 samples with 13 samples that had a level > 100 cfu/100 ml and 5 samples with level > 200 cfu/100 ml. Useful considerations derived from the analysis of the literature about the profile and prophylactic treatment of infection by Pseudomonas, necessarily to be taken into consideration for an adequate risk assessment.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25369712","annotations":[{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.839625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.510207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.434188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.405063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.37201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Water pollution","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.272232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.226491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Rome","weight":0.154987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.153892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.105721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Swimming (sport)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"24th century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24th_century_BC"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Planned maintenance","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_maintenance"},{"name":"Colony-forming unit","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony-forming_unit"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Environmental monitoring","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_monitoring"}]}
