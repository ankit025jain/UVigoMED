{"id":52782,"title":"[Presentations and management of adrenal hypertension].","abstract":"The frequency of the diagnosed causes of secondary hypertension is only known from hospital-based records, which probably overestimate the true prevalence. Excluding oral contraceptive users and cases with renal failure, their overall frequency was estimated at 1 percent in the eighties, 5 percent in the nineties, and 9 percent in recent years. This increase in frequency was mostly due to an increased number of diagnosed cases of endocrine hypertension. The diagnosis of endocrine hypertension is not synonymous with the diagnosis of a surgically correctable form of hypertension. Indeed, hypertension is surgically curable in a minority of patients, mostly in patients with aldosterone-secreting adenomas or with pheochromocytomas or functional paragangliomas. The presentation, screening, diagnosis and therapeutic management of endocrine hypertension are discussed in the present issue.
