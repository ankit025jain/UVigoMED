{"id":40261,"title":"Accelerated balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration without indwelling balloon occlusion for gastric varices with small gastrorenal shunts using a terminal gelfoam plug.","abstract":"We performed balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration in three consecutive patients with small gastric varices without indwelling balloon catheter occlusion. Foam of 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate mixed with iodized oil and room air was injected retrograde through the gastrorenal shunt, followed by a thick absorbable gelatin sponge (Gelfoam, Pfizer) plug under only 10-minute balloon occlusion.Because complete obliteration of gastric varices was achieved in all patients without any complications, our technique is considered to be safe and effective for small gastric varices.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055282","annotations":[{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.689691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Gelatin","weight":0.685405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.412673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Sponge","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Foam","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Balloon catheter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_catheter"},{"name":"Gastric varices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_varices"},{"name":"Sodium tetradecyl sulfate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_tetradecyl_sulfate"},{"name":"Pfizer","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Immanence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanence"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Iodized salt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodized_salt"},{"name":"Varices","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varices"}]}
