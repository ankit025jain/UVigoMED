{"id":77610,"title":"[Asbestos cement factory in Broni (Pavia, Italy): a mortality study].","abstract":"To date, no study has reported cause-specific Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMR) for asbestos-cement workers at a manufacturing establishment in Broni (Pavia, Italy). This site is among those specifically targeted by Italian Law for reclamation (SIN - Site of National Interest for remediation).To provide cause-specific SMRs for asbestos-cement workers in the Broni (Pavia, Italy) factory, with particular regard to duration of employment and latency.Cause-specific SMRs for asbestos-cement workers (1296 workers hired since 1/1/1950 and with follow-up period 1/1/1970-30/06/2004: 1254 males and 42 females, 545 deaths, 523 males and 22 females) were calculated using the cause-specific mortality rates for the Lombardy Region. Similarly, for pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma and lung cancer among male workers, SMRs by duration of employment and latency were calculated.Significantly increased SMRs were observed among male workers for pleural (SMR 17.99, 95% CI 11.75-26.36) and peritoneal (SMR 10.10, 95% CI 4.05-20.77) mesothelioma and lung cancer (SMR 1.26, 95% CI 1.02-1.55) and among female workers for pleural mesothelioma (SMR 68.90, 95% CI 8.33-248.90) and ovarian cancer (SMR 8.56, 95% CI 1.04-30.91). Only among male workers, was a significant risk trend observed for pleural mesothelioma by duration of employment and for lung cancer by latency. Significantly reduced SMRs were observed, among male workers for all causes of death, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.The results of this cohort study showed increased SMRs for pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma and lung cancer among male workers and for pleural mesothelioma and ovarian cancer among female workers. These results are consistent with the literature data.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552091","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.89194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.843153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.760555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Asbestos","weight":0.689717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.687537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.680965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.657534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.632809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Mesothelioma","weight":0.563317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelioma"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.542531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.281729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.241976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.224882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.218847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Environmental remediation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_remediation"},{"name":"Lombardy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy"},{"name":"Pavia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavia"},{"name":"Peritoneal mesothelioma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneal_mesothelioma"},{"name":"Factory","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Land reclamation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reclamation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"}]}
