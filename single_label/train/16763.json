{"id":16763,"title":"Oxidative stress and antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens: state of the art, methodologies, and future trends.","abstract":"Despite the significant advances of modern medicine and the availability of a wide variety of antibiotics for the treatment of microbial infections, there is an alarming increase of multiresistant bacterial pathogens. This chapter discusses the status of bacterial resistance mechanisms and the relationship with oxidative stress and provides an overview of the methods used to assess oxidative conditions and their contribution to the antibiotic resistance.
