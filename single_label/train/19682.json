{"id":19682,"title":"Infectious complications of stem cell transplantation.","abstract":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an accepted treatment for a variety of hematologic malignancies. The profound immunosuppression these patients experience adversely affects their risk of infection. This risk is much higher than in the general population and requires aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. The chapter will outline the major infections after HSCT.
