{"id":90652,"title":"Infant abusive head trauma prevention: acceptability of the Period of PURPLE Crying® program in far North Queensland, Australia.","abstract":"A study examined the appropriateness and likelihood of usage of the north American Period of PURPLE Crying® intervention program in far north Queensland, to educate families about the risk of infant abusive head trauma (AHT)/shaken baby syndrome.A mixed-method cross-sectional study with a questionnaire and semi-structured interview was conducted with 33 health professionals in far north Queensland (FNQ) to gauge their opinions of the Period of PURPLE Crying program's educational materials.Seventy per cent of participants were aware of infant AHT; 87.8% agreed the program would be appropriate for far north Queensland populations; 90% agreed that new parents/carers could learn new strategies to deal with inconsolable crying, and that men would be particularly advantaged.In their present form, the educational materials of the Period of PURPLE Crying are appropriate for use. As such, the researchers intend to undertake a pilot implementation in FNQ.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24588356","annotations":[{"name":"Infant","weight":0.541668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.471137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.462713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Queensland","weight":0.445962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.431715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.309381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Domestic violence","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Purple (cipher machine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_(cipher_machine)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Crying","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crying"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Track gauge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge"},{"name":"Seventy (Latter Day Saints)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Period (geology)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(geology)"},{"name":"Regions of Queensland","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Queensland"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Far North Queensland","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland"},{"name":"North Queensland","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"TNQ","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNQ"}]}
