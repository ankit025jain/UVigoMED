{"id":82367,"title":"Effect of fluoride varnish supplemented with sodium trimetaphosphate on enamel erosion and abrasion.","abstract":"To assess in vitro the effect on enamel erosion (ERO) and erosion followed by abrasion (ERO+ABR) of varnishes with different fluoride concentrations, supplemented or not with sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP).Bovine enamel blocks were randomly divided into six groups according to the type of varnish used: placebo (no F), NaF 5%, NaF 2.5%, NaF 2.5% plus TMP 3.5%, NaF 2.5% plus TMP 5%, NaF 2.5% plus TMP 10%. Varnishes were tested for ERO and ERO+ABR, separately for 3 and 5 days. ERO was done by immersion in Sprite Zero (5 minutes, 4x/day), while ERO+ABR was performed by brushing for 15 seconds after each erosive challenge. Enamel wear (microm) and cross-sectional hardness (AKHN) were assessed after the experimental periods. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey's test and Pearson's correlation coefficient (P< 0.05).Varnishes supplemented with TMP promoted significantly lower wear and hardness loss when compared to the other treatments in all conditions studied (P< 0.05). Similar wear rates were observed for the placebo, NaF 2.5% and NaF 5% varnishes (P> 0.05). Greater wear was observed after 5 days of ERO and ERO+ABR when compared with 3 days (P< 0.05). Positive and significant correlations were found between enamel wear and AKHN. No dose-response relationship was found between TMP concentration and wear and hardness. It was concluded that fluoride varnishes supplemented with TMP had a higher protective effect against ERO and ERO+ABR, which was associated with a reduction in enamel softening.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640433","annotations":[{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.668899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.573984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Varnish","weight":0.363449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnish"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.363121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Hardness","weight":0.248706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness"},{"name":"Sodium fluoride","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.110673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0818325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Sprite Zero","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_Zero"},{"name":"Sodium trimetaphosphate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_trimetaphosphate"},{"name":"Sprite (soft drink)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(soft_drink)"},{"name":"0 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Pulp (paper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(paper)"},{"name":"New Zealand Education Review Office","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Education_Review_Office"},{"name":"Morleys (department store)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morleys_(department_store)"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Wear","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
