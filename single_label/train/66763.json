{"id":66763,"title":"Sildenafil improves erectile hardness in Chinese men with erectile dysfunction: a real-life study analyzed on age stratification.","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical efficacy of sildenafil for the improvement of penile erection hardness in erectile dysfunction (ED) patients and to determine the relationship between this improvement in erection hardness and social and psychological functioning.From 2007 to 2008, a total of 4507 men diagnosed with ED were enrolled from 46 centers in China; 4039 of these patients were treated with sildenafil and asked to complete the Erectile Function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function, Erection Hardness Score, and Quality of Erection Questionnaire. The patients were divided into 5 groups on the basis of their age (group A: 20-30 years; group B: 31-40 years; group C: 41-50 years; group D: 51-60 years; and group E: >60 years).A total of 3837 (95.0%) patients completed the entire study. After sildenafil treatment, the vast majority (96.3%) of the men were able to achieve grade 3-4 erection hardness. Patients with a better baseline erection hardness were more able to achieve grade 4 hardness after treatment (P <.001). Comparisons of the Erection Hardness Score improvement before and after treatment between the age-categorized groups also showed that the erection hardness improvement was much greater in men older than 50 years.Sildenafil can help the vast majority of Chinese ED patients achieve grade 3-4 erection hardness. Grade 4 hardness can improve the patients' sexual life to a greater extent than grade 3 hardness. A marked improvement in erection hardness can be achieved in patients older than 50 years.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680453","annotations":[{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"China","weight":0.676482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.631935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.531283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.515908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.326731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.322908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sildenafil","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.221176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.214119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Fourth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_grade"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Hardness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness"},{"name":"UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group E","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2008_qualifying_Group_E"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
