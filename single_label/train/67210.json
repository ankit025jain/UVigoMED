{"id":67210,"title":"Synergistic anti-tumor effects of combined gemcitabine and cisplatin nanoparticles in a stroma-rich bladder carcinoma model.","abstract":"Tumors grown in a stroma-rich mouse model resembling clinically advanced bladder carcinoma with UMUC3 and NIH 3T3 cells have high levels of fibroblasts and an accelerated tumor growth rate. We used this model to investigate the synergistic effect of combined gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP) nanoparticles and Cisplatin nanoparticles (Combo NP) on tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs). A single injection of Combo NP had synergistic anti-tumor effects while the same molar ratio of combined GMP and Cisplatin delivered as free drug (Combo Free) fell outside of the synergistic range. Combo NP nearly halted tumor growth with little evidence of general toxicity while Combo Free had only a modest inhibitory effect at 16mg/kg GMP and 1.6mg/kg Cisplatin. Combo NP increased levels of apoptosis within the tumor by approximately 1.3 folds (TUNEL analysis) and decreased ?-SMA-positive fibroblast recruitment by more than 87% (immunofluorescence) after multiple injections compared with Combo Free, GMP NP or Cisplatin NP alone. The TAF-targeting capability of Combo NP was evaluated by double staining for TUNEL and ?-SMA at various time points after a single injection. On day one after injection, 57% of the TUNEL-positive cells were identified as ?-SMA-positive fibroblasts. By day four, tumor stroma was 85% depleted and 87% of the remaining TAFs were TUNEL-positive. Combo NP-treated tumors became 2.75 folds more permeable than those treated with Combo Free as measured by Evans Blue. We conclude that the antineoplastic effect of Combo NP works by first targeting TAFs and is more effective as an anti-tumor therapy than Combo Free, GMP NP or Cisplatin NP alone.
