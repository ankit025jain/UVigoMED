{"id":46380,"title":"Results of modified uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction after distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer.","abstract":"The frequent occurrence of bile gastritis and esophagitis associated with dehiscence of 'uncut' jejunal portion was of concern for \"uncut\" Roux-en-Y reconstruction after distal gastrectomy. Our aim was to study if our technique of a modified, uncut Roux-en-Y procedure would decrease this dehiscence.Ten patients with gastric cancer underwent distal gastrectomy with a modified, uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction. Transmural silk stitches were added around the staples at the \"uncut\" portion in attempt to prevent dehiscence of the staple line. Dehiscence of the jejunum at the enterically closed site was investigated endoscopically or fluoroscopically.Mean operative time and intraoperative blood loss were 246 minutes and 381 mL, respectively. Morbidity occurred in three patients. No dehiscence was observed in any of the patients examined.These results suggest the possibility that our technique of a modified, uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction after distal gastrectomy decreases dehiscence of enterically closed portion.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634948","annotations":[{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.898264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Esophagitis","weight":0.820679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagitis"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.800383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.67113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.375957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"Enteric coating","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_coating"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.346548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.143501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"381","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/381"},{"name":"246","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/246"},{"name":"Surgical staple","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_staple"},{"name":"The Staple","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Staple"},{"name":"Silk","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk"},{"name":"Dehiscence (botany)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehiscence_(botany)"}]}
