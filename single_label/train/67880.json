{"id":67880,"title":"Improving 2D-3D registration optimization using learned prostate motion data.","abstract":"Prostate motion due to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) probe pressure and patient movement causes target misalignments during 3D TRUS-guided biopsy. Several solutions have been proposed to perform 2D-3D registration for motion compensation. To improve registration accuracy and robustness, we developed and evaluated a registration algorithm whose optimization is based on learned prostate motion characteristics relative to different tracked probe positions and prostate sizes. We performed a principal component analysis of previously observed motions and utilized the principal directions to initialize Powell's direction set method during optimization. Compared with the standard initialization, our approach improved target registration error to 2.53 +/- 1.25 mm after registration. Multiple initializations along the major principal directions improved the robustness of the method at the cost of additional execution time of 1.5 s. With a total execution time of 3.2 s to perform motion compensation, this method is amenable to useful integration into a clinical 3D guided prostate biopsy workflow.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579132","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.633497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.480204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.473576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.466079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Principal component analysis","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.391438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.196861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Motion compensation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_compensation"},{"name":"Prostate biopsy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_biopsy"},{"name":"Transrectal ultrasonography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrectal_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Booting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting"},{"name":"Microsoft Direct3D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Direct3D"},{"name":"Continuous track","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_track"},{"name":"Image registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration"},{"name":"Run time (program lifecycle phase)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Amenable group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenable_group"},{"name":"25 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Robust statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"James Powell and Sons","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Powell_and_Sons"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Space probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe"},{"name":"Workflow","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow"}]}
