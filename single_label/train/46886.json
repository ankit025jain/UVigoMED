{"id":46886,"title":"miR-146a G>C polymorphisms and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in a Chinese population.","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are thought to have a role in cancer development. We investigated the association among miR-146a G>C genetic variations, hepatitis B (HBV), and C (HCV) infection, and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unconditional logistical regression analysis suggested that the miR-146a GG genotype and G allele carried a 2.10- (95 % confidence interval (CI)=1.03-4.37) and 1.42-fold (95 % CI=1.07-1.92) increased HCC risk, respectively. HBV-positive subjects carrying the miR-146a GG genotype (odds ratio (OR)=2.95, 95 % CI=1.31-6.81) and G allele (OR=1.65, 95 % CI=1.15-2.58) had an increased risk of HCC. However, the miR-146a GG genotype and G allele did not carry a significantly enhanced risk of HCC in either hepatitis-negative or HCV-infected subjects. miR-146a G>C polymorphisms appear to influence susceptibility to HCC, especially in HBV-infected patients.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615520","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.922164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.84026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.615992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Genetic variation","weight":0.492394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.431881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.375442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.36825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"China","weight":0.140815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"CI1 fossils","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI1_fossils"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"}]}
