{"id":86597,"title":"Evaluation and treatment of chronic cough.","abstract":"Chronic cough is a frustrating and common problem, resulting in significant psychological and physical sequelae as well as enormous financial costs in terms of health care expense and time lost from work. Decreased QoL and depression are common. However, using a systematic approach, including assessing whether the patient uses ACE-I and cigarettes, excluding the presence of red flags and risk factors for life-threatening diseases, and obtaining and normal chest radiograph, more than 90% of cases of chronic cough are diagnosed as being caused by UACS, asthma, or GERD. It is recommended to address these conditions sequentially, starting with UACS. Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis and pertussis infections are unrecognized by primary care providers and should be considered after UACS, asthma, and GERD have been addressed. Finally, cough hypersensitivity syndrome is a new area of research and has been hypothesized to be the underlying factor in many cases of chronic cough, regardless of the inciting factor. More clinical research is needed to further elucidate the cough reflex pathway and the factors involved in modulating its sensitivity, which may eventually lead to new antitussive therapeutics.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758953","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of
