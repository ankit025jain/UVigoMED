{"id":86129,"title":"The incidence and management of postoperative chylothorax after pulmonary resection and thoracic mediastinal lymph node dissection.","abstract":"Our objective was to determine the incidence and optimal management of chylothorax after pulmonary resection with complete thoracic mediastinal lymph node dissection (MLND).This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent pulmonary resection with MLND.Between January 2000 and December 2012, 2,838 patients underwent pulmonary resection with MLND by one surgeon (RJC). Forty-one (1.4%) of these patients experienced a chylothorax. Univariate analysis showed that lobectomy (p<0.001), a robotic approach (p=0.03), right-sided operations (p<0.001), and pathologic N2 disease (p=0.007) were significantly associated with the development of chylothorax. Multivariate analysis showed that lobectomy (p=0.011), a robotic approach (p=0.032), and pathologic N2 disease (p=0.027) remained predictors. All patients were initially treated with cessation of oral intake and 200 ?g subcutaneous somatostatin every 8 hours. If after 48 hours the chest tube output was less than 450 mL/day and the effluent was clear, patients was given a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) diet and were observed for 48 hours in the hospital. If the chest tube output remained below 450 mL/day, the chest tube was removed, they were discharged home with directions to continue the MCT diet and to return in 2 weeks. Patients were instructed to consume a high-fat meal 24 hours before their clinic appointment. If the patient's chest roentgenogram was clear at that time, they were considered \"treated.\" This approach was successful in 37 (90%) patients. The 4 patients in whom the initial treatment was unsuccessful underwent reoperation with pleurodesis and duct ligation.Chylothorax after pulmonary resection and MLND occurred in 1.4% of patients. Its incidence was higher in those with pathologic N2 disease and those who underwent robotic resection. Nonoperative therapy is almost always effective.","date":"2014-07-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24811982","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Chest radiograph","weight":0.798415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_radiograph"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.73884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.716901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.695113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chest tube","weight":0.685066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_tube"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.622669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Lobectomy","weight":0.605358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobectomy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.190374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Pleurodesis","weight":0.169444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurodesis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.13054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.120317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Somatostatin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.0518106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0438327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Chylothorax","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chylothorax"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Meal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
