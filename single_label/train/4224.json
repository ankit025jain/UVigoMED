{"id":4224,"title":"[Treatment of combined hyperlipidemia patients by jiangzhi tongluo soft capsule combined atorvastatin calcium tablet: a clinical study].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of using Jiangzhi Tongluo Soft Capsule (JTSC) combined with Atorvastatin Calcium Tablet (ACT) or ACT alone in treatment of combined hyperlipidemia.A randomized, double blinded, parallel control, and multi-center clinical research design was adopted. Totally 138 combined hyperlipidemia patients were randomly assigned to the combined treatment group (A) and the atorvastatin treatment group (B) by random digit table, 69 in each group. All patients took ACT 20 mg per day. Patients in the A group took JTSC 100 mg each time, 3 times per day. Those in the B group took JTSC simulated agent, 100 mg each time, 3 times per day. The treatment period for all was 8 weeks. Serum levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were observed before treatment, at week 4 and 8 after treatment; and safety was assessed as well.At week 4 and 8 after treatment serum TG decreased by 26.69% and 33.29% respectively in the A group (both P < 0.01), while it was decreased by 25.7% and 22.98% respectively in the B group (both P < 0.01). At week 8 decreased serum TG was obviously higher in the A group than in the B group (P < 0.05). Compared with before treatment, serum levels of LDL-C and TC levels decreased significantly in the two groups (all P < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in the drop-out value and the drop-out rate of serum LDL-C and TC levels (P > 0.05). At week 8 the serum HDL-C level showed an increasing tendency in the two groups. No obvious increase in peptase or creatase occurred in the two groups after treatment.JTSC combined with ACT could lower the serum TG level of combined hyperlipidemia patients with safety.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335328","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Atorvastatin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atorvastatin"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.875525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.836981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Double-blind","weight":0.785169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-blind"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.706565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.687462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.352625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Combined hyperlipidemia","weight":0.178312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.115637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Design of experiments","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Dropping out","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropping_out"}]}
