{"id":82874,"title":"[Expression of Prion protein and its clinical significance in oral squamous cells carcinoma and oral leukoplakia].","abstract":"To examine Prion protein(PrP) expression and its clinical significance in oral mucosa, oral leukoplakia, oral squamous cell carcinoma(OSCC) and its subgroups.Expression of PrP in OSCC, oral leukoplakia and mucosa specimen was detected by immunohistochemistry. The association between the expression and gender, TNM clinical stages, pathological grades was evaluated.The positive expression rate of PrP in normal, oral leukoplakia and OSCC tissues was 15% (3/20) , 42% (11/26) and 95% (80/84) , respectively. There was a significant difference between the expression of PrP in leukoplakia and in high, moderately and poorly differentiated OSCC(P < 0.05). The positive expression rate was increased with the declining of pathological differentiation (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in PrP expression among lymph node metastasis and gender. PrP expression of stages I and II was up-regulated with the decreased differentiation (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in PrP expression between stage III and IV (P > 0.05). Between stages I+II and III+IV in the overa II expression of PrP, there was a significant difference(P < 0.05).The high expression of PrP in OSCC and the progressive expression from leukoplakia to OSCC was closely related to the carcinogenesis of OSCC, pathologic stage and clinical TNM stage.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495728","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Leukoplakia","weight":0.894492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukoplakia"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.656001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.595153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.563739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.557294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prion","weight":0.45135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"PRNP","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRNP"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"}]}
