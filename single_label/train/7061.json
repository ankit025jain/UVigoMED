{"id":7061,"title":"Intratypic heterologous vaccination of calves can induce an antibody response in presence of maternal antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease virus.","abstract":"Maternal antibodies can interfere with foot-and-mouth disease vaccination. In this study we determined whether intratypic heterologous vaccination could help to improve herd immunity.In unvaccinated calves, a half-life of maternal antibodies of 21 days was determined. At two weeks of age, calves without maternal antibodies showed a good antibody response against both vaccines used in the trial, while in calves with maternal antibodies no antibody response to homologous vaccination (A Turkey 14/98) but a limited antibody response to intratypic heterologous vaccination (A22 Iraq) was observed.Two weeks old calves without maternal antibodies respond well to vaccination, but when emergency vaccination is carried out in a region that uses prophylactic vaccination, using an intratypic heterologous vaccine strain may improve the immunity in calves with maternal antibodies.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906852","annotations":[{"name":"Herd immunity","weight":0.827477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.713157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.464844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.401079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Iraq","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq"},{"name":"Passive immunity","weight":0.274584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_immunity"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.130071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"A22 road","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A22_road"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"1498","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1498"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Heterologous","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous"},{"name":"Calf (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"}]}
