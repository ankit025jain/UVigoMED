{"id":73947,"title":"Study of circulating microRNA-125b levels in serum exosomes in advanced melanoma.","abstract":"Malignant melanoma is an aggressive tumor that produces exosomes, which contain microRNAs (miRNAs) that could be of utility in following tumoral cell dysregulation. MicroR-125b is a miRNA whose down-regulation seems to be implicated in melanoma progression.To analyze miR-125b levels in serum, and in exosomes obtained from serum, from patients with advanced melanoma.Serum samples were obtained from 21 patients with advanced melanoma, from 16 disease-free patients with melanoma, and from 19 healthy volunteers. Exosomes were isolated from serum by precipitation, and miR-16 and miR-125b levels were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction.MicroR-16, but not miR-125b, was detected in all samples, and miR-16 levels were significantly higher in serum than they were in exosomes. MicroR-16 expression levels did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (patients with melanoma and healthy donors). There was a significant relationship between miR-125b and miR-16 levels in exosomes. Additionally, miR-125b levels in exosomes were significantly lower in patients with melanoma compared with disease-free patients with melanoma and healthy controls.Exosomes can provide a suitable material to measure circulating miRNA in melanoma, and miR-16 can be used as an endogenous normalizer. Lower levels of miR-125b in exosomes obtained from serum are associated with advanced melanoma disease, probably reflecting the tumoral cell dysregulation.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24878024","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.618384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.586484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.421369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.161245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Normalizer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalizer"},{"name":"Exosome (vesicle)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosome_(vesicle)"},{"name":"Exosome complex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosome_complex"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Emotional dysregulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Precipitation (meteorology)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)"}]}
