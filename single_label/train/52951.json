{"id":52951,"title":"[Efficacy of CT-guided splanchnic nerve block for persistent pain after fluoroscopy-guided nerve block in a patient with advanced pancreatic cancer].","abstract":"We report a successful case of CT-guided splanchnic nerve block in a patient with advanced pancreatic cancer. A 76-year-old woman with epigastric distress was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer with multiple metastases. She underwent chemotherapy, but decided on best supportive care when her performance status worsened. Computed tomography revealed a 6 x 8 cm tumor mass in the pancreatic head. Oral oxycodone 20 mg x day(1) was ineffective and her Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score was 9. Fluoroscopy-guided splanchnic nerve block with alcohol from L1-2 significantly reduced her pain, but she still required a fentanyl patch 2.1 mg x 3 days(-1) and loxoprofen (NRS 3). Four days later, we performed CT-guided splanchnic nerve block with alcohol 10 ml from T11-12. This significantly alleviated her pain and she was discharged uneventfully. She died 3 weeks after discharge. CT-guided splanchnic nerve block may be useful in cases of insufficient pain relief after fluoroscopy-guided splanchnic nerve block.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558942","annotations":[{"name":"Oxycodone","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Fentanyl","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Epigastrium","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigastrium"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.625404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.614821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Nerve block","weight":0.528904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_block"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.454215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.42989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.421109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.420417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.3065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0713771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Splanchnic nerves","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splanchnic_nerves"},{"name":"Transdermal patch","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal_patch"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"1112","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1112"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Nielsen ratings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"University of California Natural Reserve System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California_Natural_Reserve_System"},{"name":"Splanchnic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splanchnic"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"LSWR L12 class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSWR_L12_class"}]}
