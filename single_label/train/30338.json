{"id":30338,"title":"[No opiates against cannabis hyperemesis syndrome].","abstract":"An otherwise healthy 25-year-old patient with heavy cannabis-abuse suffered from an undiagnosed cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) over years, which characteristically was resistant to usual antiemetics. In an apparently last attempt at healing, opiates (morphine, methadone) were administrated and improved the CHS, however, this led to an at least as equally distressing and painful opiate withdrawal syndrome.In the controlled cannabis abstinence during the 2-week inpatient treatment of opiate addiction syndrome the CHS has not recurred.Opiates are not suited for the treatment of CHS because they are addictive and lead to respiratory depression in overdose.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519114","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoventilation","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoventilation"},{"name":"Methadone","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone"},{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Opiate","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiate"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome","weight":0.822272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome"},{"name":"Antiemetic","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiemetic"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.772147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Opioid dependence","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_dependence"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.510689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.505388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.480203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Hyperemesis gravidarum","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperemesis_gravidarum"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.159096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Inpatient care","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient_care"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"}]}
