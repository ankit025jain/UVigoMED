{"id":31510,"title":"Vaccination of preterm infants by polyvalent vaccines: immunogenicity and safety- review of literature.","abstract":"The immunization of infants against infectious diseases still raises many controversies, not only with parents, but also among physicians. This refers particularly to preterm infants. Due to the increasing popularity of polyvalent vaccines, a number of studies has recently been conducted to verify their immunogenicity and safety in preterm infants. The aim of the present paper was to review the current literature dealing with the problem in question. The following recommendations regarding the use of polyvalent vaccines in preterm infants and neonates with low birth weight can be formulated on the basis of current evidence (1). Due to sufficient immunogenicity, polyvalent vaccines can be administered to preterm infants in accordance with their calendar age (2). Booster vaccination of preterm infants after completing 12 months of age is vital for achieving complete and persistent immunity against all vaccine antigens (3). In order to reduce the risk of adverse events after the administration of a polyvalent vaccine, it is essential to carefully consider the cardiorespiratory status of preterm infants during preimmunization examination, as well as their history of any cardiorespiratory dysfunctions. In such cases administering the first dose of the vaccine in a hospital setting is strongly advised.
