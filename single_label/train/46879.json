{"id":46879,"title":"Evidence for a change in the epidemiology of hepatitis B virus infection after nearly two decades of universal hepatitis B vaccination in South Africa.","abstract":"The hepatitis B vaccine has been part of the South African Expanded Program on Immunization since April 1995 but its long-term impact remains unknown. This study tested 1,206 sera collected from patients aged 1-25 years from various health facilities across the country for HBV serological markers and HBV DNA. Based on the year the vaccine was introduced, samples were stratified by age into pre- and post-vaccine introduction populations, which were then compared for evidence of immunity and chronic carriage using the Chi-square test. Where HIV status was known, subset analyses were performed. Immunity to HBV infection increased from 13.0% in the pre- to 57.0% in the post-vaccine introduction population (P?<?0.001). This decreased with increasing age within the post-vaccine introduction population (76.1% for 1-5 years, 50.0% for 6-10 years, and 46.3% for 11-16 years). In addition, HBV chronic carriage was significantly (P?=?0.003) reduced in the post- (1.4%) compared to the pre-vaccine introduction population (4.2%). The difference in prevalence of active HBV infection in the serologically exposed pre- and post-vaccine introduction populations was not statistically significant. Subset analyses showed that evidence of immunity was significantly (P?<?0.001) higher in the HIV negative compared to the HIV positive subset in both populations. Universal hepatitis B vaccination has been a remarkable success, with a significant increase in immunity to HBV infection. The observation that HBV chronic carriage increases as immunity wanes over time calls into question whether the time has come to consider a pre-adolescence vaccine booster dose policy.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615635","annotations":[{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.911937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Hepatitis B vaccine","weight":0.692342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_vaccine"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.609204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.583941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.446866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.313387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Booster dose","weight":0.219521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"HIV-positive people","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV-positive_people"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"Universal Studios","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Universal health care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Expanded Program on Immunization","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_Program_on_Immunization"}]}
