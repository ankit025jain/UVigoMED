{"id":56373,"title":"Functional and psychosocial impact of strabismus on Singaporean children.","abstract":"To quantify the effects of strabismus in Singaporean children using the Intermittent Exotropia Questionnaire (IXTQ) and the Adult Strabismus 20 Questionnaire (AS20).Consecutive strabismus patients 5-16 years of age were recruited along with an equal number of age-matched controls with eye conditions other than strabismus and amblyopia (group A) and controls with no known eye conditions (group B). All children completed the IXTQ; those 8-16 years of age also completed the AS20 questionnaire. Parents completed the parental proxy IXTQ (pp-IXTQ) and AS20 (pp-AS20) and a parental IXTQ (PIXT).A total of 60 patients and 60 age-matched controls in each group were included. Children with strabismus had lower IXTQ (70.1 ± 19.0) and AS20 (80.0 ± 13.8) scores than those in group B (IXTQ, 90.3 ± 11.8 [P < 0.001]; AS20, 90.0 ± 10.9 [P < 0.001]) and group A (IXTQ, 80.6 ± 14.9 [P = 0.001]; AS20, 81.6 ± 18.3 [P = 0.691]). Among children with strabismus, child IXTQ scores were significantly lower than parental proxy scores (70.1 ± 19.0 vs 76.4 ± 15.8 [P = 0.026]), but there was no difference in control group scores or with AS20 scores. Item-level analysis suggested that children's worry focused on what others thought about them and their ability to make friends, whereas parents were more concerned about eyesight and whether surgery was required.The IXTQ and AS20 were better at differentiating between children with strabismus and those with no eye condition than between children with strabismus and other eye conditions. Parental proxies were accurate in predicting child scores but parents were more likely to underestimate the psychosocial effects of their children's strabismus.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698617","annotations":[{"name":"Strabismus","weight":0.233635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus"},{"name":"Amblyopia","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Exotropia","weight":0.0311921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotropia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0200714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Demographics of Singapore","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Singapore"},{"name":"816","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/816"},{"name":"Proxy (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_(statistics)"},{"name":"Intermittent stream","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_stream"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Salmson 9","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmson_9"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"}]}
