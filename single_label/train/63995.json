{"id":63995,"title":"[Borrelial lymphocytoma].","abstract":"Borrelial lymphocytoma is a relatively rare but typical presentation of Lyme disease. Predilection sites are the ears in children and chest/nipples in adults. It is treated like an erythema migrans and has a good prognosis.A 16-year-old boy presented with a swollen, red and painful right nipple since several months. An ultrasound showed normal breast tissue. The patient was referred to the pediatric surgeon who performed an incision biopsy. Histopathological examination revealed follicular hyperplasia without signs of malignancy. An infectious cause, most likely Lyme disease, was suspected. Serological analysis and PCR of the tissue confirmed the diagnosis of a borrelial lymphocytoma, and the patient was treated with doxycycline with good result.Early recognition of the characteristic clinical presentation of borrelial lymphocytoma, supported by positive results from serologic testing for Lyme disease, avoids the need for additional and invasive diagnostic tests.","date":"2014-01-02","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24382037","annotations":[{"name":"Lyme disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"},{"name":"Doxycycline","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxycycline"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nipple","weight":0.651122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.559091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.536003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.520412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.485583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.324642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.276491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Erythema chronicum migrans","weight":0.216923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema_chronicum_migrans"},{"name":"Pediatric surgery","weight":0.200755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_surgery"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_lymphoid_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Follicular thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_thyroid_cancer"}]}
