{"id":80099,"title":"[Analysis of endemic situation of schistosomiasis in Yugan County of Jiangxi Province in 2012].","abstract":"To master the epidemic situation and control effect of schistosomiasis in Yugan County, Jiangxi Province.The data of the schistosomiasis prevalence in human and cattle as well as Oncomelania hupensis snail status were collected and the change trends were analyzed in Yugan County from 2008 to 2012.The schistosome infection rates of residents in Yugan County have declined every year since 2008, and currently, the prevalence of schistosomiasis was at a low level. No acute schistosomiasis case was found during the past 5 years. In 2012, the infection rate of bovine was above 1% in 88 endemic villages, and the area with schistosome infected snails was 10 hm2.In order to achieve the goal of schistosomiasis transmission control in the whole county in 2015, the comprehensive control measures based on infection source control should be strengthened.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800580","annotations":[{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.89825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.798868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.554162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.534067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.399324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.330116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Hectare","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare"},{"name":"Revision control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Yugan County","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugan_County"},{"name":"Jiangxi","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"County","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County"},{"name":"2015","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Master's degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"}]}
