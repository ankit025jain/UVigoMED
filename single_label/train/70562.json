{"id":70562,"title":"[Apoptosis of melanoma B16 cells induced by gambogenic acid].","abstract":"To study the inhibitory effect of Gambogenic acid (GNA) on melanoma B16 cells proliferation, and to explore the role of cell apoptosis.The inhibitory effect of GNA on the proliferation of B16 cells was measured by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay; Alternation of B16 cells ultrastructure was detected by AO/EB staining under fluorescent microscope; Flow cytometry was used to detect intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in B16 cells generated by GNA treatment Western blotting was used to investigate the expression of intracellular Caspase-3 proteins changes.MTT results showed that the GNA within a certain time and a certain concentration significantly suppressed the proliferation of B16 cells and morphological changes were observed by fluorescence microscope on B16 cells after GNA treatment. AO/EB staining showed that the major cell density decreased. GNA treated cells showed obvious apoptotic status. After the cells treated with GNA, in a short period of time, intracellular ROS levels increased dramatically compared with the control group (P < 0.01), and the mitochondrial membrane had a low potential consistently. Western blotting results showed that changes of intracellular proteins expression in the release of Caspase-3 proteins expression levels were increased after GNA treatment.GNA can inhibit malignant melanoma B16 cells growth and proliferation and induce apoptosis within a certain time and at a certain concentration.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174115","annotations":[{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.908265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Fluorescence microscope","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.767901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.637209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.57819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.554684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.531935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.338408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.270474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.243284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0682477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ultrastructure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrastructure"},{"name":"Thiazole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiazole"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Glycol nucleic acid","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycol_nucleic_acid"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
