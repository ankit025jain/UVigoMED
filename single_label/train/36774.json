{"id":36774,"title":"Partial trisomy 3p and partial monosomy 11q associated with double outlet right ventricle and septum pellucidum et vergae: a case report.","abstract":"Su Partial trisomy 3p and partial monosomy 11q are rare chromosomal disorders with a deletion of part of chromosome 11 combined with a duplication of part of chromosome 3. These are usually inherited from a parent who carries a balanced translocation involving chromosome 3, which can result in the unbalanced translocation trisomy 3p in a child. In this paper, we report a newborn who has dysmorphic facial features, double outlet right ventricle, hypotonia, hypospadias, neonatal thrombocytopenia, hydroureteronephrosis, talipes equinovarus and septum pellucidum et vergae. Cytogenetic investigation revealed 46,XY,der(11)t(3;11)(p22.2;q23.3) and the karyotype of his father showed a balanced translocation, 46XY,t(3;11)(p22.2;p23.3).","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551981","annotations":[{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Club foot","weight":0.887757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_foot"},{"name":"Hypotonia","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotonia"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Hypospadias","weight":0.817494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypospadias"},{"name":"XY sex-determination system","weight":0.812922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system"},{"name":"Monosomy","weight":0.806779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosomy"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Chromosome 3 (human)","weight":0.749018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_3_(human)"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Aneuploidy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Gene duplication","weight":0.604945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplication"},{"name":"Chromosome 11 (human)","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_11_(human)"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.356322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.205489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Dysmorphic feature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmorphic_feature"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"}]}
