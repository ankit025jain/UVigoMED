{"id":58609,"title":"[The insulin-like growth factor IGFBP-1--specific marker for preterm delivery in pregnant women with clinical symptoms].","abstract":"The insulin-like growth factor IGFBP-1 is a binding protein (IBP-1), also known as placental protein (PP12), is encoded in people as IGFBP-1 gene. This gene encodes a protein in the domain of IGFBP-1 and domain thyroglobulin. During the last years highly phos-phorylated versions of IGFBP-1 (IGFBP-1 pM) have been found in decidual cells--a marker of threat for preterm birth. The quantity analysis of the insulin-like growth factor in the serum or heparinized plasma is used to locate diseases related to growth. Its levels in the plasma can scarcely be determined after birth and steadily rise with age while they reach their maximum during puberty. These levels rise constantly during pregnancy.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919336","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.785321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.779694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.630041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Eutheria","weight":0.424601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.317672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.180524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.01992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor-binding_protein"},{"name":"Polypropylene","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
