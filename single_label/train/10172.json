{"id":10172,"title":"Sulforhodamine 101 selectively labels human astrocytoma cells in an animal model of glioblastoma.","abstract":"Sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) is a useful tool for immediate staining of astrocytes. We hypothesized that if the selectivity of SR101was maintained in astrocytoma cells, it could prove useful for glioma research. Cultured astrocytoma cells and acute slices from orthotopic human glioma (n=9) and lymphoma (n=6) xenografts were incubated with SR101 and imaged with confocal microscopy. A subset of slices (n=18) were counter-immunostained with glial fibrillary acidic protein and CD20 for stereological assessment of SR101 co-localization. SR101 differentiated astrocytic tumor cells from lymphoma cells. In acute slices, SR101 labeled 86.50% (±1.86; p<0.0001) of astrocytoma cells and 2.19% (±0.47; p<0.0001) of lymphoma cells. SR101-labeled astrocytoma cells had a distinct morphology when compared with in vivo astrocytes. Immediate imaging of human astrocytoma cells in vitro and in ex vivo rodent xenograft tissue labeled with SR101 can identify astrocytic tumor cells and help visualize the tumor margin. These features are useful in studying astrocytoma in the laboratory and may have clinical applications.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666692","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.733472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Astrocytoma","weight":0.709541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocytoma"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.684639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.562791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Neuroglia","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroglia"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.521151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.461358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Astrocyte","weight":0.432886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.343158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.322866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.275391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.20613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"CD20","weight":0.205003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD20"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Glial fibrillary acidic protein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glial_fibrillary_acidic_protein"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
