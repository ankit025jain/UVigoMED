{"id":62150,"title":"Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and chromosome 1 amplification have poor outcomes despite the use of novel triplet regimens.","abstract":"The prognostic impact of amplification of chromosome 1(C1A) in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (nMM) patients treated with the most commonly used bortezomib-based triplet regimens is unclear. In this study, we analyzed the outcome of novel triplet therapies in a series of unselected patients with C1A detected by FISH. We identified 28 unselected nMM patients with C1A who had a gain of 1q21 locus. Despite 50% of patients being diagnosed at ISS stage 1 or 2 and 93% having no other high-risk molecular findings, the median overall survival of all patients was only 37 months, with 8 deaths (29%) occurring 8-37 months after diagnosis. Those who died had a median of four lines (range was 1-8) of therapy. Moreover, 71% of patients were non-Caucasian. Extra-osseous and CNS involvement occurred in 36 and 11% of patients respectively. Gain of the long arm of chromosome 1 detected by FISH remains a high-risk prognostic marker even in the setting of novel triplet therapies.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616227","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.894038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.470734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.206125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chromosome 1 (human)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_1_(human)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"International Space Station","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"837","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/837"},{"name":"Gain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"1C Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1C_Company"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Multiple birth","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_birth"}]}
