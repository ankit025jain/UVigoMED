{"id":53392,"title":"Linking the circadian rhythm gene Arntl2 to interleukin 21 expression in type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"The circadian rhythm-related aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like 2 (Arntl2) gene has been identified as a candidate gene for the murine type 1 diabetes locus Idd6.3. Previous studies suggested a role in expansion of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells, and this then creates an imbalance in the ratio between T-effector and CD4(+)CD25(+) T-regulator cells. Our transcriptome analyses identify the interleukin 21 (IL21) gene (Il21) as a direct target of ARNTL2. ARNTL2 binds in an allele-specific manner to the RNA polymerase binding site of the Il21 promoter and inhibits its expression in NOD.C3H congenic mice carrying C3H alleles at Idd6.3. IL21 is known to promote T-cell expansion, and in agreement with these findings, mice with C3H alleles at Idd6.3 produce lower numbers of CD4(+)IL21(+) and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells compared with mice with NOD alleles at Idd6.3. Our results describe a novel and rather unexpected role for Arntl2 in the immune system that lies outside of its predicted function in circadian rhythm regulation.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520124","annotations":[{"name":"Circadian rhythm","weight":0.845846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.8309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.784556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"RNA polymerase","weight":0.734757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.725411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.697123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Candidate gene","weight":0.58362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.578289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.561076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.55682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.41588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor","weight":0.346332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor"},{"name":"Transcriptome","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.332706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Hydrocarbon","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Aryl","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryl"},{"name":"Congenic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenic"},{"name":"Interleukin 21","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_21"},{"name":"ARNTL","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARNTL"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Tritium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"NOD mice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOD_mice"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
