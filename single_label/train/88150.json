{"id":88150,"title":"Effects of traumatic brain injury on locomotor adaptation.","abstract":"Locomotor adaptation is a form of short-term learning that enables gait modifications and reduces movement errors when the environment changes. This adaptation is critical for community ambulation for example, when walking on different surfaces. While many individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) recover basic ambulation, less is known about recovery of more complex locomotor skills, like adaptation. The purpose of this study was to investigate how TBI affects locomotor adaptation.Fourteen adults with TBI and 11 nondisabled comparison participants walked for 15 minutes on a split-belt treadmill with 1 belt moving at 0.7 m/s, and the other at 1.4 m/s. Subsequently, aftereffects were assessed and de-adapted during 15 minutes of tied-belt walking (both belts at 0.7 m/s).Participants with TBI showed greater asymmetry in interlimb coordination on split-belts than the comparison group. Those with TBI did not adapt back to baseline symmetry, and some individuals did not store significant aftereffects. Greater asymmetry on split-belts and smaller aftereffects were associated with greater ataxia.Participants with TBI were more perturbed by walking on split-belts and showed some impairment in adaptation. This suggests a reduced ability to learn a new form of coordination to compensate for environmental changes. Multiple interacting factors, including cerebellar damage and impairments in higher-level cognitive processes, may influence adaptation post-TBI.Gait adaptation to novel environment demands is impaired in persons with chronic TBI and may be an important skill to target in rehabilitation.(See Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A74) for more insights from the authors.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24892766","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.862193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Motor coordination","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.607037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.491827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.398738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.287497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Treadmill","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treadmill"}]}
