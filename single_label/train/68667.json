{"id":68667,"title":"A comparison of the outcome of adolescent and adult-onset systemic lupus erythematosus.","abstract":"Previous reports have suggested that juvenile-onset SLE is associated with a worse prognosis than adult-onset disease. There have been limited studies in adolescents. We sought to assess the effect of adolescent-onset SLE on the clinical course of a large multi-ethnic cohort.Patients consisted of individuals diagnosed with SLE between 11 and 18 years of age in a tertiary referral centre. All patients with adult-onset disease were used as controls. Data were analysed by univariable and multivariable analysis for demographic, clinical and serological data.One hundred and twenty-four patients with adolescent-onset and 484 patients with adult-onset disease were identified. There was a higher percentage of males (12.9% vs 7.2%; P = 0.036) and patients of Asian ethnicity within the adolescent group (P < 0.01). By univariable analysis, adolescent-onset SLE was associated with more frequent LN and haemolytic anaemia and less serositis and SS. Ischaemic vascular events occurred in 32 adult-onset patients (6.6%) and 3 adolescent-onset patients (2.4%; P = 0.08). Thirty-five adult-onset patients developed cancer (6.8%) compared with five of the adolescent-onset group (4.8%; P = 0.54). The standardized mortality rate was significantly increased in females with adolescent-onset SLE (14.4; 95% CI 4.44, 24.4) compared with patients with adult-onset SLE. By multivariable analysis, adolescent-onset SLE retained a significant association with LN.Adolescent-onset SLE is associated with a significantly increased risk of LN and, importantly, with a marked increase in mortality. These data suggest a more aggressive phenotype of disease in patients with onset of SLE in adolescence and supports the need for intensive follow-up and intensive therapy in this population.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505121","annotations":[{"name":"Hemolytic anemia","weight":0.822248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolytic_anemia"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.816621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.645108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.571584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.457721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.446245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.372321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.338268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.174371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Schutzstaffel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
