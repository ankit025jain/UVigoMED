{"id":24886,"title":"[Design of traditional Chinese medicines with antihypertensive components based on medicinal property combination modes].","abstract":"Multi-component traditional Chinese medicines are an innovative research mode for traditional Chinese medicines. Currently, there are many design methods for developing multi-component traditional Chinese medicines, but their common feature is the lack of effective connection of the traditional Chinese medicine theory. In this paper, the authors discussed the multi-component traditional Chinese medicine design methods based on medicinal property combination modes, provided the combination methods with the characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine for the prescription combinations, and proved its feasibly with hypertension cases.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25276949","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.57674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.222201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.20207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"China","weight":0.173757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.125389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.044539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Property","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"Multi-component reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-component_reaction"},{"name":"Design methods","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_methods"}]}
