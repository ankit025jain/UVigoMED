{"id":45796,"title":"Contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasonography in the differential diagnosis of gallbladder wall thickening.","abstract":"Differentiation of gallbladder (GB) carcinoma from benign GB wall thickening is challenging. The recent introduction of second-generation ultrasonic contrast agents has made contrast harmonic imaging with EUS possible. The aim of our study was to evaluate the utility of contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS (CH-EUS) for the differential diagnosis of GB wall thickening.Thirty-six consecutive patients with GB wall thickening imaged by CH-EUS and then underwent surgery were enrolled in this study. After the lesions were observed with conventional harmonic EUS (H-EUS), CH-EUS was performed with intravenous injection of 0.015 ml/kg of Sonazoid. Three reviewers with various levels of experience of EUS (Reviewer A: experienced endosonographer, B: EUS trainee, C: experienced gastroenterologist with expertise in transabdominal ultrasound but no EUS experience) were blinded to findings of recorded video of H-EUS and CH-EUS. The diagnostic accuracy of H-EUS and CH-EUS for malignant GB wall thickening was compared.Final diagnoses based on surgical histology were GB carcinoma in 16, cholecystitis in 11, adenomyomatosis in 6 and cholesterolosis in 3. Overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for diagnosing malignant GB wall thickening of H-EUS and CH-EUS were 83.3 versus 89.6, 65 versus 98% (p < 0.001) and 73.1 versus 94.4% (p < 0.001). The inter-observer agreement for H-EUS was moderate (? = 0.51), whereas that for CH-EUS was substantial (? = 0.77). The inhomogeneous enhanced pattern on CH-EUS was a strong predictive factor of malignant GB wall thickening.CH-EUS has the potential to improve the preoperative diagnostic accuracy and inter-observer agreement in the differential diagnosis of GB wall thickening.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24664415","annotations":[{"name":"Cholecystitis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystitis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.740967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.676714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Endoscopic ultrasound","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_ultrasound"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.633497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.604021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.18028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Thickening agent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thickening_agent"}]}
