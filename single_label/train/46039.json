{"id":46039,"title":"Acute obstructive cholangitis complicated by tumor migration after transarterial chemoembolization: a case report and literature review.","abstract":"Intraductal tumor invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is considered rare. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is effective for tumor thrombus of HCC in the bile duct. However, a few cases of obstructive jaundice caused by migration of a tumor fragment after TACE have recently been reported. The aim of this study was to identify factors that affect tumor migration after TACE. At this writing, a review of the medical literature disclosed seven reported cases of biliary obstruction caused by migration of a necrotic tumor cast after TACE. We, herein, report on an additional case of acute obstructive cholangitis complicated by migration of a necrotic tumor cast after TACE for intrabile duct invasion of HCC, in a 71-year-old man. The tumor cast in the common bile duct was removed successfully using a basket during ERCP and was pathologically confirmed to be a completely necrotic fragment of HCC. The patient's symptoms showed dramatic improvement. In summary, physicians should be aware of acute obstructive cholangitis complicated by tumor migration in a patient undergoing TACE. We suggest that an intrabile duct invasion would be a major predisposing factor of tumor migration after TACE and drainage procedures such as ERCP or percutaneous transbiliary drainage could be effective treatment modalities in these patients.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651590","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.814059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.633837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.587313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.536687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.449525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Chemoembolization","weight":0.0695946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoembolization"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Medical literature","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_literature"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Orthopedic cast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_cast"},{"name":"Cholangitis","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangitis"}]}
