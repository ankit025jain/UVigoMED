{"id":63235,"title":"Early cytomegalovirus reactivation leaves a specific and dynamic imprint on the reconstituting T cell compartment long-term after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","abstract":"Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation frequently occurs during the early phase of immune recovery after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Whereas the recovery of virus-specific immunity in the early phase after HSCT is extensively studied, the impact of CMV on the reconstitution and composition of the T cell compartment long-term after HSCT is unknown. We analyzed T cell reconstitution 1 to 2 years after HSCT in 131 pediatric patients. One year after HSCT, patients with early CMV reactivation (n = 46) had 3-fold higher CD8(+) T cell numbers (median, 1323 versus 424 cells/?L; P < .0001) compared with patients without CMV reactivation (n = 85). This effect, caused by a major expansion of CD8(+) effector memory (EM) and end-stage effector (EMRA) T cells, was independent of pretransplantation donor and recipient CMV serostatus and not seen after Epstein-Barr virus or adenovirus reactivations. At 1 and 2 years after HSCT, the absolute numbers of CD8(+) naive and central memory T cells, as well as CD4(+) naive, CM, EM, and EMRA T cells, did not differ between patients with or without CMV reactivation. In the second year after HSCT, a significant contraction of the initially expanded CD8(+) EM and EMRA T cell compartments was observed in patients with early CMV reactivation. In conclusion, CMV reactivation early after pediatric HSCT leaves a specific and dynamic imprint on the size and composition of the CD8(+) T cell compartment without compromising the reconstitution of CD8(+) and CD4(+) naive and central memory T cells pivotal in the response to neo and recall antigens.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462981","annotations":[{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Adenoviridae","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.844502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.669984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Memory T cell","weight":0.546737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_T_cell"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.507659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.268332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.260377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.124493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Cellular compartment","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_compartment"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"}]}
