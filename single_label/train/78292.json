{"id":78292,"title":"Hearing aid handling skills: relationship with satisfaction and benefit.","abstract":"To evaluate hearing aid handling skills for new and experienced users and to assess if such skills influence user's benefit and satisfaction.Seventy four participants (mean age of 70.43), experienced (n=37) or new hearing aid users (n=37) performed the tasks of \"Practical Hearing Aid Skills Test\" (PHAST), which were scored on a five-point Likert scale - higher scores indicate better hearing aid handling skills. Experienced users answered the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) and the hearing aid benefit for handicap reduction was calculated by the hearing handicap inventory (HHIA/HHIE).Medians for PHAST total scores of 79 and 71% were obtained for experienced and new users, respectively - there were no significant difference between groups. Lower PHAST scores were observed for the tasks of volume control manipulation and telephone usage. Moderate correlations were obtained between IOI benefit and quality of life items and the PHAST scores. There was no correlation between the results of PHAST and demographic data of the participants.There was no difference in handling skills between new and experienced hearing aid users. Handling skills affected hearing aid benefit.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714854","annotations":[{"name":"Likert scale","weight":0.508237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.396987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.234465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.232227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.201251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Medes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medes"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"International Olympiad in Informatics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Newbie","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newbie"},{"name":"Seventy (Latter Day Saints)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)"},{"name":"Scale (map)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Psychological manipulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation"}]}
