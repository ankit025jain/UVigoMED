{"id":47910,"title":"Effect of grape procyanidins on tumor angiogenesis in liver cancer xenograft models.","abstract":"In recent years a wide variety of flavonoids or polyphenolic substances have been reported to possess substantial anti-carcinogenic and antimutagenic activities. Grape proanthocyanidins (GPC) are considered as good examples for which there is evidence of potential roles as anti-carcinogenic agents.A xenograft model was established using H22 cells subcutaneously injected into mice and used to assess different concentrations of grape proanthocyanidins (GPC) and Endostar. Treatments were maintained for 10 days, then levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel density (MVD) were examined by immunohistochemistry, while VEGF mRNA was determined by real-time PCR in tumor tissue.The expression of MVD and VEGF decreased gradually as the concentration of GPC increased.There was a significant positive correlation between MVD and VEGF.These results suggest that GPC restrains the growth of tumor, possibly by inhibiting tumour angiogenesis.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568488","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Mutagen","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagen"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.694493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.660458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.632099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.590136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.575932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.574852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.441246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.368093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Polyphenol","weight":0.36327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphenol"},{"name":"Grape","weight":0.285879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Proanthocyanidin","weight":0.119278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proanthocyanidin"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
