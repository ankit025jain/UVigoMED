{"id":54658,"title":"Wavefront analysis after wavefront-guided myopic LASIK using a new generation aberrometer.","abstract":"To evaluate the short-term aberrometric outcomes of wavefront-guided LASIK for the correction of low to moderate myopia and myopic astigmatism using a new generation aberrometer (iDesign System; Abbott Medical Optics, Inc., Santa Ana, CA).Charts of 92 eyes of 46 patients successively treated by wavefront-guided LASIK for myopia and/or myopic astigmatism were retrospectively reviewed at 3 months postoperatively. Aberrometric analysis of the wavefront errors was performed for a 6-mm pupil diameter to investigate the surgical induction of the total higher-order aberrations (HOAs), spherical aberrations Z41, and coma-like aberrations Z3 . Additionally, correlations between the magnitude of aberrations induced with the level of achieved correction and the preoperative amount of aberrations were tested.A minimal but statistically significant induction in all of the aberrations tested was observed at 3 months postoperatively (P < .01), with an increase (calculated for a 6-mm pupil) of +0.12 + 0.2, +0.06 + 0.1, and 0.05 + 0.1 pm in the root mean square (RMS) total HOA, RMS spherical aberration Z41, and RMS coma Z31, respectively. The postoperative change in aberrations was poorly correlated with both the level of achieved myopic correction for all of the aberrations tested (r < 0.3; P < .001) and the preoperative level of spherical aberrations (r = 0.3; P < .05) and coma (r = 0.46; P < .05).Wavefront-guided LASIK using the new generation Hartmann-Shack aberrometer allows a minimal induction of HOAs regardless of the level of myopic correction achieved or the preoperative magnitude of aberrations.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25250416","annotations":[{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.789078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Spherical aberration","weight":0.782074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.720987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Wavefront","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.553367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.530904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Root mean square","weight":0.442177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square"},{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.155747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Picometre","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picometre"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Z3 (computer)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Atomic number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Electricity generation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Maxima and minima","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Square (algebra)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(algebra)"},{"name":"Nissan 300ZX","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_300ZX"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Santa Ana, California","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ana,_California"},{"name":"Mathematical induction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction"},{"name":"Homeowner association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeowner_association"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
