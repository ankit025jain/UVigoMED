{"id":81890,"title":"Reconciling the clinical practice guidelines on Bell's palsy from the AAO-HNSF and the AAN.","abstract":"Bell palsy, named after the Scottish anatomist Sir Charles Bell, is the most common acute mononeuropathy, or disorder affecting a single nerve, and is the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis. In the past 2 years, both the American Academy of Neurology and the Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation have published clinical practice guidelines aimed at improving the quality of care and outcomes for patients diagnosed with Bell palsy. This commentary aims to address the similarities and differences in the scope and final recommendations made by each guideline development group.
