{"id":22095,"title":"Sternal wrapping: developments and results.","abstract":"Postoperative sternal wound complications are infrequent events that negatively affect recovery and may have serious consequences. Sternal wrapping, a technique of sternal care, has hemostatic properties without bone wax, and offers mechanical and microbiologic protection.From February 1998 to December 2011, 258 patients in 2 Italian institutions underwent various cardiac surgery procedures with sternal wrapping in place, and were followed up for no less then 6 months.Two (0.8%) extremely compromised patients with ischemic sternal osteonecrosis and deep sternal wound infection required a sternal stabilizing procedure. Four (2%) other patients developed sternal wound complications that were treated entirely medically; 3 of them were very trivial, and 1 was an atypical mediastinitis without sternal involvement. Overall, 46.1% of patients (45.3% of isolated coronary artery bypass, 49.3% of isolated on-pump coronary artery bypass, and 18.2% of off-pump coronary artery bypass patients) were transfused. None of the complications was related to sternal wrapping, bleeding from the sternal edge, or sternal wound problems.Sternal wrapping showed a very low incidence and severity of sternal wound complications, with good prevention of sternal osteomyelitis. Hemostatic properties were satisfactory, with transfusion rates within an acceptable range.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570499","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Mediastinitis","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinitis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Human sternum","weight":0.769557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sternum"},{"name":"Osteomyelitis","weight":0.754552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomyelitis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.728095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.684737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.48428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.440985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.154987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Wax","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax"}]}
