{"id":65560,"title":"Kidney sparing surgery for urothelial carcinoma of the pyelocalyceal system: is there a role for open techniques? Results from a small series.","abstract":"To evaluate individually tailored open nephron-sparing surgical techniques for urothelial carcinoma of the pyelocalyceal system (UCPCS).Four patients underwent nephron-sparing surgery for UCPCS including, open partial resection of the pyelon with peritoneal reconstruction, partial nephrectomy, open partial resection of the pyelon with kidney autotransplantation, combined open resection and calicoscopic laser coagulation.Recurrence-free survival was 24 months without any impairment of kidney function in all patients.Open nephron-sparing surgery for UCPCS should be taken into consideration for selected cases.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24807757","annotations":[{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.789184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Transitional cell carcinoma","weight":0.598337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.593124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.478289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.416574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.374923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.308685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.13109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.104762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
