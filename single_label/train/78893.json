{"id":78893,"title":"[Chronic stress as an influencing factor in tinnitus patients].","abstract":"Using the Trier Stress Inventory and based on a comparison between tinnitus and psoriasis patients, it is evaluated to what extent chronic stress is a definable influencing factor among tinnitus sufferersPsychological assessment of 114 tinnitus and 103 psoriasis inpatients was conducted using a test battery consisting of the tinnitus questionnaire (Tinnitus-Fragebogen, TF), the Trier Stress Inventory (Trierer Inventar zum chronischen Stress, TICS), a questionnaire about social support (Fragebogen zur sozialen Unterst√ºtzung, F-SozU) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ).On average, hospitalized tinnitus patients have significantly higher values than the normative group on the following scales: social tensions, excessive work demands, chronic anxiety, professional strain, professional discontent, lack of social acceptance and social isolation, as well as on the overall screening scale. The measured stress values of tinnitus patients did not significantly differ from those of the comparison group, i.e. the hospitalized psoriasis patients. Although both groups show increased stress levels as measured by TICS, the hospitalized tinnitus patients had significantly more psychological comorbidities. No relationship exists between the raised stress values and hearing status.Stress also has an influence on tinnitus suffering and is therefore certain to be of therapeutic relevance. In this respect, there is no significant difference between tinnitus and psoriasis patients; stress alone cannot explain the psychological comorbidity.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24549511","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Anxiety disorder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.696382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Social isolation","weight":0.580956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_isolation"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Chronic stress","weight":0.540241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_stress"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.535816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tinnitus","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.363246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.235185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.180556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Trier","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trier"},{"name":"Patient Health Questionnaire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Health_Questionnaire"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Definable real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definable_real_number"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Class conflict","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_conflict"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Open marriage acceptance","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_marriage_acceptance"}]}
