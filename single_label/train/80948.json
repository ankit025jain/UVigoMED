{"id":80948,"title":"[Investigation on intestinal nematode infections of rural people in Jiangning District, Nanjing City].","abstract":"To understand the prevalence of intestinal nematodiasis in rural people in Jiangning District, Nanjing City, so as to provide the evidence for the establishment of the control programs of the disease.The residents and primary and secondary school students aged above 6 years in Tongshan Township, Jiangning District were selected as investigation objectives, and the Kato-Katz technique was used to detect the intestinal nematode eggs in feces of them.Four hundred and ten villagers were detected, and the infection rates of Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm were 5.12% and 0.98%, respectively. Meanwhile, 407 students were detected, and the infection rates of Ascaris lumbricoides and Fasciolopsis buski were 1.72% and 0.25%, respectively. The infection rates of intestinal nematodes in villagers and students were 6.10% and 1.97%, respectively, and the difference between them were statistically significant (chi2 =8.997, P < 0.05).The infection rate of intestinal nematodes in rural population of Jiangning District, Nanjing City has decreased obviously, and the rate is higher in villagers than in students. Therefore, the control work in the future should put emphasis on villagers.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490416","annotations":[{"name":"Hookworm","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookworm"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.748069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.631761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Nanjing","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.370858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.362318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Ascaris lumbricoides","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris_lumbricoides"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Ascaris","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.176462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Fasciolopsiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasciolopsiasis"},{"name":"Jiangning District","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangning_District"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"407","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/407"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Fasciolopsis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasciolopsis"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Township (New Jersey)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Township_(New_Jersey)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
