{"id":84128,"title":"[Zero-profile implant for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion in treating single cervical disc herniation].","abstract":"To explore the efficacy and safety of zero-profile implant for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in treating single cervical disc herniation.From August 2011 to June 2012,30 patients with single cervical disc herniation were treated with ACDF using zero-profile implant in one motion segment. There were 18 males and 12 females with a mean age of 55.3 years old (ranged, 36 to 68). Incidence of dysphagia, height of intervertebral space and condition of bone fusion were observed after operation. Spinal nerves function and clinical results were assessed according to Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, Odom criteria.All patients were followed up from 12 to 24 months with an average of 15.9 months. The mean intraoperative blood loss was (85.3 +/- 14.2) ml (70 to 120 ml) and operative time was (90.0 +/- 12.8) min (70 to 120 ml). Preoperative, postoperative at 3 months and 1 year, JOA score was 8.72 +/- 2.36 (5.0 to 13.0), 14.72 +/- 1.66 (11.5 to 17.0) and 15.65 +/- 1.03 (13.5 to 17.0), respectively. One year after operation, according Odom criteria to assess, 22 cases got excellent results, 7 good, 1 fair. All dysphagiaes vanished completely at 3 months after operation. The lost height of intervertebral space was (0.34 +/- 0.13) mm (0.1 to 0.6 mm) and (0.39 +/- 0.15) mm (0.2 to 0.7 mm) at 3, 12 months after operation, respectively. All patients obtained bone fusion at 1 year after operation.The zero-profile implant is a valid alternative to anterior cervical plate in treating single cervical disc herniation with ACDF, it has advantages of convenient procedure, satisfactory effect, lower incidence of postoperative dysphagia, reliable stability and less implant-related complications.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
