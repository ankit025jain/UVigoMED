{"id":65876,"title":"Distinct metabolic characteristics and risk of stone recurrence in patients with multiple stones at the first-time presentation.","abstract":"To characterize the clinical and metabolic abnormalities of patients presenting with multiple stones and determine their risk of new stone formation.This retrospective case-controlled study consisted of 911 patients who had ureter stones for the first time and 107 age- and sex-matched patients without stones. The patients were classified into 2 groups: those with a single ureter stone (n = 690) and those with 1 or more additional stones somewhere in the ureter or kidney (n = 221). All patients underwent 24-hour urinary metabolic evaluation. The 240 patients (26.3%) who were followed for >12 months (median follow-up, 35.0 months) were included in recurrence analyses. Stone recurrence was defined as \"new stone formation,\" namely, the radiographic appearance of stones that had not been present in previous examinations.The multiple-stone group had significantly lower urinary citrate excretion than the single-stone (P = .011) and control (P = .003) groups. Compared with the single-stone group, it also had a higher incidence of hypocitraturia (P = .011) and stone recurrence (27 of 84 [32.1%] vs 29 of 156 [18.6%] patients; P = .025). Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that stone multiplicity (hazard ratio, 2.343; 95% confidence interval, 1.302-4.220; P = .005) was an independent predictor of recurrent stone formation. Kaplan-Meier curves showed identical results.The patients with multiple stones had distinct metabolic characteristics, particularly hypocitraturia and a significantly higher risk of recurrence than patients with 1 stone. Patients with multiple stones, even if it is their first stone episode, should undergo metabolic evaluation and possibly also potassium citrate therapy to prevent future stones.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768010","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.711368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.594927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.353172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.252943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.23109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.182608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Potassium citrate","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_citrate"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"690","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/690"},{"name":"240","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"List of rock formations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rock_formations"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Citrate","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrate"}]}
