{"id":57126,"title":"Bisphenol-A exposures and behavioural aberrations: median and linear spline and meta-regression analyses of 12 toxicity studies in rodents.","abstract":"Exposures to bisphenol-A, a weak estrogenic chemical, largely used for the production of plastic containers, can affect the rodent behaviour. Thus, we examined the relationships between bisphenol-A and the anxiety-like behaviour, spatial skills, and aggressiveness, in 12 toxicity studies of rodent offspring from females orally exposed to bisphenol-A, while pregnant and/or lactating, by median and linear splines analyses. Subsequently, the meta-regression analysis was applied to quantify the behavioural changes. U-shaped, inverted U-shaped and J-shaped dose-response curves were found to describe the relationships between bisphenol-A with the behavioural outcomes. The occurrence of anxiogenic-like effects and spatial skill changes displayed U-shaped and inverted U-shaped curves, respectively, providing examples of effects that are observed at low-doses. Conversely, a J-dose-response relationship was observed for aggressiveness. When the proportion of rodents expressing certain traits or the time that they employed to manifest an attitude was analysed, the meta-regression indicated that a borderline significant increment of anxiogenic-like effects was present at low-doses regardless of sexes (?)=-0.8%, 95% C.I. -1.7/0.1, P=0.076, at ?120 ?g bisphenol-A. Whereas, only bisphenol-A-males exhibited a significant inhibition of spatial skills (?)=0.7%, 95% C.I. 0.2/1.2, P=0.004, at ?100 ?g/day. A significant increment of aggressiveness was observed in both the sexes (?)=67.9,C.I. 3.4, 172.5, P=0.038, at >4.0 ?g. Then, bisphenol-A treatments significantly abrogated spatial learning and ability in males (P<0.001 vs. females). Overall, our study showed that developmental exposures to low-doses of bisphenol-A, e.g. ?120 ?g/day, were associated to behavioural aberrations in offspring.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25242006","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.663352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.629539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.505455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.476225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Lactation","weight":0.255323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.122383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.056379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Quantity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Spline (mathematics)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Spatial memory","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_memory"}]}
