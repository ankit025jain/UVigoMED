{"id":60958,"title":"The copper chelator ATN-224 induces caspase-independent cell death in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.","abstract":"Bcl-2 and other anti-apoptotic proteins are associated with defective caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways, resulting in chemoresistance. We have previously shown that ATN-224, a copper chelator drug, induces cell death in murine thymic lymphoma cells transfected with Bcl-2. In the current study, we tested whether ATN-224 was effective in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells, which have increased anti?apoptotic proteins through translocation or amplification. We found that nanomolar concentrations of ATN-224 induced cell death in DLBCL cells independent of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 status. ATN-224 treatment resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction, release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and induction of caspase-independent cell death. In addition, ATN-224 degraded Mcl-1 and enhanced the effect of the BH3 mimetic ABT-263. These findings indicate that ATN-224 has potential as a therapeutic for the treatment of DLBCL. Induction of caspase?independent cell death in apoptosis?resistant DLBCL would provide a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of refractory disease.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788952","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Chelation","weight":0.888889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelation"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.737674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.709945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.599981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.560458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.53031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.521533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.489433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.468265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.220694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.164312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.158226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.135743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"263","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/263"},{"name":"224","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/224"},{"name":"Black hole","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"American Ballet Theatre","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ballet_Theatre"},{"name":"ATN","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATN"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
