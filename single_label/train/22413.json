{"id":22413,"title":"Prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women in Maiduguri, North-Eastern Nigeria.","abstract":"This study determined the prevalence and socio-demographic characteristics of bacterial vaginosis (BV) among pregnant women with abnormal vaginal discharge.Descriptive cross-sectional study.University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital.Vaginal swab samples and data on epidemiological risk factors were collected from 400 consecutive pregnant women with complaints of abnormal vaginal discharge. The data was analyzed using the SPSS 16.0 statistical software. Association between variables was compared by using the Chi-square (?2 ) and Fisher's exact tests while P < 0.05 was considered significant at 95.0% confidence level.The prevalence of BV among pregnant women with abnormal vaginal discharge was 17.3%. Age 20-24 years, multigravidity, lack of western education and unemployment were associated with increased prevalence of BV. Yellowish, watery vaginal discharge (P = 0.001) was associated with BV. Dysuria, dyspareunia and lower abdominal tenderness were associated with BV (P = 0.001). Fifty three (77%) of patients had BV during the second trimester compared to 6 (9%) who had it in the 1 st trimester of pregnancy (P = 0.012).The high prevalence of BV in this study may necessitate adequate screening of pregnant women with abnormal vaginal discharge in order to give appropriate treatment and avoid complications associated with it.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Bacterial
