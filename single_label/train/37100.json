{"id":37100,"title":"Ephrin B2 and EphB4 selectively mark arterial and venous vessels in cerebral arteriovenous malformation.","abstract":"Ephrin type B receptor 4 (EphB4, Eph receptor) selectively binds ephrin B2 (Eph ligand). EphB4/ephrin B2 is involved in embryonic vessel development, vascular remodelling and pathological vessel formation in adults (including tumour angiogenesis). Binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A to the endothelial-specific receptor VEGF receptor-2 is the main extracellular signal triggering angiogenic response. Little is known about the role of EphB4/ephrin B2 during angiogenesis and arteriovenous plasticity in cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cAVM). This study investigated EphB4 and ephrin B2 expression in cAVM.Haemorrhagic (H-AVM) and nonhaemorrhagic (NH-AVM) specimens of AVM nidus, obtained after microsurgical cAVM resection, and normal superficial temporal artery (STA) specimens, were analysed retrospectively. VEGF-A, EphB4 and ephrin B2 expression were studied by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting.In cAVM (10 H-AVM; 10 NH-AVM), VEGF-A was immunocytochemically localized to endothelial cells; strong endothelial cell staining was found for EphB4 in veins and ephrin B2 in arteries. Normal STA (n = 10) did not express EphB4 or ephrin B2. EphB4 and ephrin B2 expression was greater in H-AVM than in NH-AVM.Endothelial cells are more active in H-AVM than NH-AVM. EphB4 and ephrin B2 play important roles in neovascularization and arteriovenous differentiation/plasticity. These data provide new insights into the aetiology of cAVM and lay a foundation for further study. The notch pathway induced by VEGF-A may be a key signalling pathway in this process.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517927","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"VEGF receptors","weight":0.873318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEGF_receptors"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.844924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.801116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.733582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.69807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Ephrin receptor","weight":0.644252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephrin_receptor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.630405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.616713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.564344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.513152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.383838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.369607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.36955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.368144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.342427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.31286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Neuroplasticity","weight":0.166114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cerebral arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Notch signaling pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notch_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"}]}
