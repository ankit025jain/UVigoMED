{"id":5028,"title":"Advances in skin grafting and treatment of cutaneous wounds.","abstract":"The ability of the skin to repair itself after injury is vital to human survival and is disrupted in a spectrum of disorders. The process of cutaneous wound healing is complex, requiring a coordinated response by immune cells, hematopoietic cells, and resident cells of the skin. We review the classic paradigms of wound healing and evaluate how recent discoveries have enriched our understanding of this process. We evaluate current and experimental approaches to treating cutaneous wounds, with an emphasis on cell-based therapies and skin transplantation.
