{"id":4211,"title":"Metabolomics in dyslipidemia.","abstract":"Hyperlipidemia is an important public health problem with increased incidence and prevalence worldwide. Current clinical biomarkers, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol lack the necessary specificity and sensitivity and only increase significantly after serious dyslipidemia. Therefore, sensitive biomarkers are needed for hyperlipidemia. Hyperlipidemia-specific biomarkers would improve clinical diagnosis and therapeutic treatment at early disease stages. The aim of metabolomics is to identify untargeted and global small-molecule metabolite profiles from cells, biofluids, and tissues. This method offers the potential for a holistic approach to improve disease diagnoses and our understanding of underlying pathologic mechanisms. This review summarizes analytical techniques, data collection and analysis for metabolomics, and metabolomics in hyperlipidemia animal models and clinical studies. Mechanisms of hypolipemia and antilipemic drug therapy are also discussed. Metabolomics provides a new opportunity to gain insight into metabolic profiling and pathophysiologic mechanisms of hyperlipidemia.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25344987","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.840486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.822255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.701318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.68777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Holism","weight":0.486072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism"},{"name":"Metabolomics","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolomics"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.115427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.0514337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Holistic health","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holistic_health"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0181577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"}]}
