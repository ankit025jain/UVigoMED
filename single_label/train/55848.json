{"id":55848,"title":"The role of proteases and inflammatory molecules in triggering neovascular age-related macular degeneration: basic science to clinical relevance.","abstract":"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) causes severe vision impairment in aged individuals. The health impact and cost of the disease will dramatically increase over the years, with the increase in the aging population. Currently, antivascular endothelial growth factor agents are routinely used for managing late-stage AMD, and recent data have shown that up to 15%-33% of patients do not respond to this treatment. Henceforth, there is a need to develop better treatment options. One avenue is to investigate the role proteases and inflammatory molecules might have in regulating and being regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor. Moreover, emerging data indicate that proteases and inflammatory molecules might be critical in the development and progression of AMD. This article reviews recent literature that investigates proteases and inflammatory molecules involved in the development of AMD. Gaining insights into the proteolytic and inflammatory pathways associated with the pathophysiology of AMD could enable the development of additional or alternative drug strategies for the treatment of AMD.
