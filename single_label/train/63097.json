{"id":63097,"title":"Exacerbation of interstitial granulomatous dermatitis with arthritis by anakinra in a patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","abstract":"Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis with arthritis (IGDA) is a rare idiopathic skin disorder with variable cutaneous expression, typically associated with a seronegative arthritis. Histopathology of this disorder reveals a granulomatous infiltrate with foci of collagen degeneration in the deep reticular dermis. We present a case of IGDA in a 56-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, exacerbated by the administration of anakinra.
