{"id":44906,"title":"Transnasal oesophagoscopy: diagnostic and management outcomes in a prospective cohort of 257 consecutive cases and practice implications.","abstract":"To determine the success rate, patient tolerability and impact of introducing transnasal oesophagoscopy on clinical practices.Prospective cohort with review of electronic patient records for outcomes.UK tertiary centre Otolaryngology Department.The cohort comprised of two hundred and fifty-seven patients, 128 females (50%) and 129 males (50%) with an age range of 20-91 years; mean age 59 years (sd 13.6).Success rates, indications, findings and outcomes of patients undergoing transnasal oesophagoscopy and impact on rigid examinations of the pharynx and oesophagus were also considered.Transnasal oesophagoscopy has a high success rate of 97%; it is well tolerated by patients, and poor views are uncommon. Pathology was detected in 44% of patients. The most common indications for transnasal oesophagoscopy were unexplained throat symptoms (50%) and dysphagia (25%). Common positive findings were hiatus hernia (7%), Barrett's oesophagus (5%), dysmotility (5%) and oesophageal candidiasis (5%). Following transnasal oesophagoscopy, 59% of patients were discharged to their referring clinician, 17% continued to undergo otolaryngology follow-up, and 13% were referred to our gastrointestinal colleagues. Following the introduction of transnasal oesophagoscopy, there was a reduction in the number of rigid examinations of the pharynx and oesophagus in the subsequent years, despite an increase in total referrals.Transnasal oesophagoscopy is a well-tolerated procedure that allows otolaryngologists to make management decisions on common referrals swiftly in the clinic setting avoiding unnecessary investigations, follow-up and referral.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713033","annotations":[{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.804468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Throat","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.629067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Candidiasis","weight":0.520145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidiasis"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.292858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.154465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Hiatus hernia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_hernia"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"257","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/257"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"2090s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2090s"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Common (entertainer)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_(entertainer)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Barrett","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
