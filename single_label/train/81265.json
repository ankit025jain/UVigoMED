{"id":81265,"title":"Bleaching technique effect on dentin permeability.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of bleaching techniques on dentin permeability. The hypothesis was that the bleaching agent associated or not to etching and/or energy source would be able to increase dentin permeability (conductance).Fifty 1 mm-thick disks of mid-coronal dentin were obtained from human third molars, which were mounted in a filtration chamber, allowing exposure of a standardized area of 0.282 mm2. All specimens were treated with 35% liquid phosphoric acid for 15 seconds to maximize dentin permeability. Then they were randomly allocated to five different conditions: C: placebo gel (negative control); HP: Whiteness HP Maxx (WM)-35% hydrogen peroxide; PA-HP: WM preceded by phosphoric acid etching for 15 seconds. HP-E: WM associated to a light source and PA-HP-E: WM preceded by phosphoric acid etching for 15 seconds and associated to a light source. The bleaching agent was applied for 10 minutes with intermediate agitation at 5 minutes. In the groups associated with a light source, it was activated for 30 seconds every 5 minutes. Afterwards, the permeability (Lp) was measured using the Flodec device. The data were collected and analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (P< 0.05).Mean and standard deviation of Lp were: C = 1.92 (1.04); HP = 1.14 (0.29); PA-HP = 14.40 (8.62); HP-E = 4.18 (5.14); PA-HP-E = 27.32 (13.24). Data revealed that phosphoric acid etching could increase the dentin permeability, while the bleaching agent or light curing alone did not.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Stomatognathic
