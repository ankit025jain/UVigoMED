{"id":55442,"title":"Refractive error change and its association with ocular and general parameters in junior high school students in Taiwan.","abstract":"To assess the relationships between refractive error and ocular and general parameters in Taiwanese junior high school students and to identify the predictive factors associated with the changes in refractive error.This was a prospective, school-based study. A total of 687 students (357 boys and 330 girls) from a municipal junior high school in Taipei were enrolled. The students' refractive status, intraocular pressure, and ocular parameters were measured first in 2010 and again 1Â year later. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression models and generalized estimating equations (GEEs).Significant differences were found between the baseline (2010) and 1-year follow-up (2011) mean anterior chamber depths, mean axial lengths, and mean horizontal and vertical corneal refractive powers. GEE models revealed that vertical and horizontal corneal refractive powers, axial length, and anterior chamber depth were significantly associated with refractive error change.Students with a longer axial length, steeper corneal radius, and shallower anterior chamber depth had an increased risk of myopic refractive errors.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24882398","annotations":[{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.443158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.24701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.119684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.10601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Taipei","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei"},{"name":"GEE (navigation)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEE_(navigation)"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Estimating equations","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimating_equations"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Municipality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality"},{"name":"357","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/357"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Horizontal plane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 687","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_687"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Horse length","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Eleventh grade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_grade"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"}]}
