{"id":17936,"title":"Slit-skin smear in leprosy: lest we forget it!","abstract":"Diagnosing and classifying leprosy solely on the basis of skin lesions as per WHO operational classification may lead to over or under diagnosis and inadequate treatment particularly of pauci-lesional multibacillary cases with consequent risk of resistance, relapse and progressive horizontal transmission. Announcing elimination of leprosy as public health problem in India under NLEP was probably ambitious aspiration. However, such a strategy is perhaps not justified scientifically at the moment in view of new case detection rate not showing significant decline. The fact remains that it is still highly desirable to provide sustained quality leprosy services to all individuals through general health services and good referral system. Being nearly of 100% specificity when performed expertly, slit-skin smear remains the simplest diagnostic technique available until new cutting-edge diagnostic tools become available for routine bedside use. However, the interest has been declining for learning this simple test among all the persons involved in leprosy work even in the teaching/training institutes. This is perhaps due to confusion over number and sites of smears, and its declining usefulness in WHO recommendations/guidelines. Various technical aspects of slit-skin smear testing are reviewed here keeping in view the need of leprosy workers in referral/teaching institutes.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834639","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.694598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.563746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.545207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.543743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"India","weight":0.34574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.305493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.150838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Mental confusion","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_confusion"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Progressivism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"}]}
