{"id":35211,"title":"Right pulmonary artery to left atrial fistula in a neonate: case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"A communication between the right pulmonary artery (RPA) and the left atrium is a rare congenital anomaly that presents with cyanosis and heart failure. We describe the surgical repair of an RPA to left atrial fistula using cardiopulmonary bypass in a neonate. Advanced imaging (computed tomography scan) guided the surgical approach. Although previous reports have associated a patent ductus arteriosus with high neonatal mortality, in our case, the ductus arteriosus was actually important for maintaining enough total pulmonary blood flow.
