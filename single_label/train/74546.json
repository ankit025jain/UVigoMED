{"id":74546,"title":"Registering cortical surfaces based on whole-brain structural connectivity and continuous connectivity analysis.","abstract":"We present a framework for registering cortical surfaces based on tractography-informed structural connectivity. We define connectivity as a continuous kernel on the product space of the cortex, and develop a method for estimating this kernel from tractography fiber models. Next, we formulate the kernel registration problem, and present a means to non-linearly register two brains' continuous connectivity profiles. We apply theoretical results from operator theory to develop an algorithm for decomposing the connectome into its shared and individual components. Lastly, we extend two discrete connectivity measures to the continuous case, and apply our framework to 98 Alzheimer's patients and controls. Our measures show significant differences between the two groups.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320795","annotations":[{"name":"Operator theory","weight":0.800245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_theory"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.566914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.538413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.455173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.237392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Integral transform","weight":0.182354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_transform"},{"name":"Nonlinear system","weight":0.171192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"},{"name":"Product topology","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_topology"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Operator (mathematics)","weight":0.0824005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Discrete mathematics","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics"},{"name":"Tractography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractography"},{"name":"Connectome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Decomposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
