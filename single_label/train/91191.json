{"id":91191,"title":"Neuromuscular dysfunction that may predict ACL injury risk: a case report.","abstract":"This case report examined the neuromuscular function of a competitive female netball player six days prior to an incident where she sustained an acute anterior cruciate ligament injury during normal sports activity. Electromyography was used to examine activation onsets of four lower limb muscles (rectus femoris, biceps femoris, medial hamstrings and gluteus medius) relative to initial contact (IC) during netball-specific landings of varying complexity. The results of the injured participant were compared to the remaining participants in the study (n=8), and the injured participant's injured limb was compared to the contralateral limb. The injured participant was the only player to record delayed pre-injury muscle onsets after IC for all muscles tested in the injured limb, while her non-injured limb was comparable to the other participants tested. Furthermore, delayed muscle onset after IC occurred more frequently as landing complexity increased. This case report suggests that delayed muscle activity onset after IC during landing may be an important risk factor for ACL injury.
