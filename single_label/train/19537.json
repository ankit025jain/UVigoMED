{"id":19537,"title":"Incidence of extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Escherichia coli among patients, healthy individuals and in the environment.","abstract":"We investigated the faecal carriage of extended spectrum ?-lactamases (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli in different groups of human subjects and in the environment. A total of 363 E. coli strains were isolated from stool samples of patients (n = 77), healthy subjects (n = 170) and from different environmental samples (n = 116). A total of 124 ESBL producing E. coli strains were isolated in this study. The frequency of ESBL producing E. coli was found to be highest (60.3%) among the strains isolated from patients, followed by healthy individuals (38%) and the environment (10.5%). The environment was observed to have a very low number of ESBL producing E. coli.
