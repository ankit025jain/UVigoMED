{"id":5026,"title":"Evidence-based medicine: Orbital floor fractures.","abstract":"After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Explain the epidemiology, anatomy, and pathophysiology of orbital floor fractures. 2. Select the optimal timing of--and understand the indications for-operative repair of orbital floor fractures. 3. List advantages and disadvantages of the surgical approaches and materials available for orbital floor reconstruction. 4. Identify special considerations in treating pediatric patients presenting with orbital floor fractures.This maintenance of certification module reviews the anatomy, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of orbital floor fractures in addition to special considerations for pediatric patients. The shows the evidence rating scale used for the literature review in creating this maintenance of certification article.","date":"2014-11-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25415098","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.829491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.452868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.254482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Orbit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification"},{"name":"Select (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(magazine)"},{"name":"Rating scale","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_scale"},{"name":"Maintenance of Certification","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_of_Certification"},{"name":"Orbital (band)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_(band)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Module (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"}]}
