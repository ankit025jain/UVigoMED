{"id":37576,"title":"Neurocognitive evidence for revision of treatment targets and guidelines for phenylketonuria.","abstract":"To compare the neurocognitive outcomes of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) to determine whether decreasing phenylalanine (Phe) levels to <240 is preferable to the use of 360 ?mol/L as an upper-target Phe level. An additional aim was to establish the influence of biochemical indices other than Phe on neurocognitive outcomes.Patients with PKU (n = 63; mean age 10.8 ± 2.3 years) and healthy controls (n = 73; mean age 10.9 ± 2.2 years) performed computerized tasks measuring neurocognitive functions (inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and motor control). Lifetime and concurrent blood Phe levels, Phe-to-tyrosine ratio (Phe:Tyr), and Phe variations were examined in relation to neurocognitive outcomes using nonparametric tests and regression analyses.Patients with PKU with Phe levels ?240 ?mol/L and healthy controls performed equally well. Patients with Phe levels between 240 and 360 ?mol/L and ?360 ?mol/L performed more poorly than did controls across tasks. Patients with Phe levels ?240 ?mol/L performed significantly better than patients with levels between 240 and 360 ?mol/L on tasks measuring inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. Absolute Phe levels and Phe variation were the best predictors of motor control, whereas Phe:Tyr were the best predictors of inhibitory control.The results of this study suggest that upper Phe targets should be lowered to optimize neurocognitive outcomes. Moreover, Phe variation and Phe:Tyr appear to be of additional value in treatment monitoring.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485821","annotations":[{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.395494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.324576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Non-parametric statistics","weight":0.0361023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Phenylketonuria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Phenylalanine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine"},{"name":"Neurocognitive","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurocognitive"},{"name":"Cognitive flexibility","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_flexibility"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine"},{"name":"240","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240"},{"name":"Lifetime (TV network)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifetime_(TV_network)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Flexibility (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexibility_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Treatise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Motor control","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_control"}]}
