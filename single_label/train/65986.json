{"id":65986,"title":"[Port site recurrence after retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma : a case report].","abstract":"A 61-year-old woman was diagnosed with left renal cell carcinoma. Clinical stage was cT1bN0M0. She underwent retroperitoneoscopic radical nephrectomy. The pathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma, pT1b, G1?G2, INF?, v(+). At 33 months postoperatively CT demonstrated an enhancing tumor just under the port site for evacuation route of the kidney. The tumor was removed by surgery. The pathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma. The patient had no recurrence or metastasis 21 months after the surgery.
