{"id":61846,"title":"Abnormalities of quantities and functions of natural killer cells in severe aplastic anemia.","abstract":"Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a rare disease characterized by severe pancytopenia and bone marrow failure. Natural killer (NK) cells are large granular lymphocytes derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or common lymphoid progenitors (CLP). They play a key role in n the innate immunity and adaptive immune. In this study, the quantitative and functional changes of natural killer (NK) cell subsets in peripheral blood of severe aplastic anemia (SAA) patients before and after immunosuppressive therapy (IST) were investigated. Results showed that the percentage of NK cells and its subsets in peripheral blood lymphocytes was decreased in SAA patients. After IST, the percentage of NK cells and their subsets increased dramatically. The median expressions of CD158a, NKG2D and NKp46 on NK cells were higher in SAA patients compared to that in normal controls, and the expressions of perforin in newly diagnosed and recovery SAA patients were higher than that in controls. Therefore, we concluded that the decrease of total NK cells, and CD56(bright), CD56(dim) NK cell subsets and the higher expressions of NKp46 and perforin on NK cells may cause the over-function of T lymphocytes and thus lead to hematopoiesis failure in SAA.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661133","annotations":[{"name":"Pancytopenia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancytopenia"},{"name":"Aplastic anemia","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplastic_anemia"},{"name":"Perforin","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforin"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.832227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.801147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.754566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.753434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.633497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.490105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.314275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.295474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.231816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Neural cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.160256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.101953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Granularity","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity"},{"name":"Peripheral blood lymphocyte","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_lymphocyte"},{"name":"NKG2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKG2"},{"name":"Aplasia","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplasia"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"}]}
