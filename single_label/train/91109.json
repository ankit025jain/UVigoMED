{"id":91109,"title":"Treatment of distal tibial shaft fractures by three different surgical methods: a randomized, prospective study.","abstract":"A few studies focused on the methods of treatment for displaced distal tibial shaft fractures have been published, all of which compared two different methods. In this randomized, prospective study, we aimed to compare minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis, locking intramedullary nail stabilization and external fixation combined with limited open reduction and absorbable internal fixation for distal tibial shaft fractures by assessing complications and secondary procedures.From November 2002 to June 2012, 137 skeletally mature patients with displaced distal tibial shaft fractures with or without fibula fracture were randomized to be treated by minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (group A, n?=?46), locking intramedullary nail (group B, n?=?46) or external fixation combined with limited open reduction and absorbable internal fixation (group C, n?=?45). Age, gender, mechanism of injury, fracture pattern and presence of open fracture were equally distributed among the three groups. Indexes for evaluation included hospital stay, operative time, time to radiographic union, union status, infection and the incidence of re-operation. Mazur ankle score was introduced for functional evaluation. Statistics Analysis System (SAS) 9.2 was used for analysis.A total of 121 patients were included in the final analysis (group A 42, group B 40 and group C 39) and evaluated after a mean of 14.8 months follow-up. There was no significant difference (P?>?0.05) in hospital stay, time to radiographic union and the incidence of union status among the three groups. Although group C was associated with less secondary procedures versus groups A and B, it was related with more pin tract infections (15.4 %). Anterior knee pain occurred frequently after locking intramedullary nailing (37.5 %) and the irritation symptoms were more frequently encountered in group A (59.5 %). There was no difference in ankle function between the three methods after operation (P?>?0.05).We consider that the minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis, locking intramedullary nail stabilization and external fixation combined with limited open reduction and absorbable internal fixation techniques are all efficient methods for treating distal tibia fractures. With its wide indications, external fixation combined with limited open reduction and absorbable internal fixation leads to minimal soft tissue complication, good functional result and no local soft tissue irritation or implant removal.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24549966","annotations":[{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.898264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.844529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.801894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Intramedullary rod","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramedullary_rod"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.679922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.655043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.547816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.488665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.479775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.230512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Knee pain","weight":0.215948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_pain"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.169322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.129465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0863472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sex reassignment surgery","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery"},{"name":"Body of tibia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_tibia"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Lower extremity of tibia","weight":0.010864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_tibia"}]}
