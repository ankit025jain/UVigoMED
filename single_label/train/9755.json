{"id":9755,"title":"Evaluation in mice of the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a tetravalent subunit vaccine candidate against dengue virus.","abstract":"A dengue vaccine must induce protective immunity against the four serotypes of the virus. Our group has developed chimeric proteins consisting of the protein P64k from Neisseria meningitidis and the domain III from the four viral envelope proteins. In this study, the immunogenicity of a tetravalent vaccine formulation using aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant was evaluated in mice. After three doses, neutralizing antibody titers were detected against the four viral serotypes, the lowest seroconversion rate being against dengue virus serotype 4. One month after the last dose, immunized animals were challenged with infective virus, and partial but statistically significant protection was found to have been achieved. Based on these results, further studies in mice and non-human primates using this tetravalent formulation in a prime-boost strategy with attenuated viruses are strongly recommended.
