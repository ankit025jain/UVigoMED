{"id":21405,"title":"Anidulafungin-induced alopecia.","abstract":"To report a case of a woman in whom alopecia appeared after several months of treatment with anidulafungin.A 34-year-old woman with chronic femoral osteomyelitis with the presence of persistent suppuration, developed a Candida albicans infection, isolated in the fistula exudate cultures. After initial failures of single therapy with azoles, it was decided to administer fluconazole and anidulafungin 100 mg/d. One month after starting the treatment, the patient mentioned a greater hair loss than usual. At 3 months, the patient stopped taking the drug on noting the loss and easy falling out of her hair, with alopecia plaques 1 to 2 cm in size. At 2 months after stopping the anidulafungin, it was decided to restart combined antifungal treatment using micafungin and fluconazole; there was no mention of new or greater loss of hair. It was decided to change micafungin to anidulafungin again 90 days after starting treatment. In the first month of treatment, there appeared to be a reactivation in hair loss that later stabilized and improved.Drug-induced hair loss is an adverse reaction that has been identified during different hair growth phases. It has been described for the azoles group and has not been associated with candins until now. Results of the causality analysis, using the probability scale established by Naranjo, found the relationship as probable.Anidulafungin could be associated with hair loss. Physicians must be aware of this adverse effect in order to approach it properly and to detect possible nonadherence to treatment.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604921","annotations":[{"name":"Fluconazole","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.847261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Osteomyelitis","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomyelitis"},{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.73303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.627009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.563444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.471683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.455971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.45257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Micafungin","weight":0.397977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micafungin"},{"name":"Anidulafungin","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anidulafungin"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.263635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.109583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Azole","weight":0.0210801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azole"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Hirsutism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsutism"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"}]}
