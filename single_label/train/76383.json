{"id":76383,"title":"[Association between the glomerular filtration rate of renal dysfunction and metabolic syndrome: an age-stratified analysis].","abstract":"To explore the relationship between the renal dysfunction rate and metabolic syndrome(MS), stratified by age.People took part in physical check-up in a certain tertiary hospital from March 2010 to September 2012, were enrolled in this study. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), -a renal dysfunction indicator, was calculated by modified MDRD equation [<60 ml/min(1.73 m(2))]. Associations between the renal dysfunction rate and factors as age, gender and MS traits, were assessed by stratified analysis.Eligible data from 75 469 subjects were used. The prevalence rates of renal dysfunctions appeared to be 0.05%,0.20%, 1.68% in 18 to 44 year-olds (youth), 45 to 59 year-olds (middle) and 60 year-olds or above (old), respectively. Participants with MS showed a significantly higher risk than those without, in the elderly only (P < 0.05)but not in the other 2 groups (P > 0.05). Participants with 2 components of MS in middle-aged, 3 or 5 components of MS in the elderly showed a significantly high incidence (P < 0.05), but no significant differences seen in other subgroups (P > 0.05). Increasing trend was not seen in all the 3 groups (P > 0.05). Elevated blood pressure (BP+) in youth and middle-aged groups, decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) in middle-aged and elderly groups and elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG+) in elderly group could all cause the abnormality rate of eGFR which showed significantly high incidence rates in the subgroup analysis (P < 0.05). The maximum of population attributable risk proportion (PAR%) was 41.91% in youth when having elevated BP. Relationship between renal dysfunction rate and triglyceride (TG)/obesity was not identified.The prevalence of renal dysfunction was found low, in Xuzhou. The incidence was not associated with the numbers but might relate to the nature of certain components of MS. Increased BP showed both short-term and mid-term effects. Decreased HDL-C, however, indicated both mid-term and long-term effects. The elevated FPG only appeared long-term effects. Increased TG and obesity did not show significant effects in these observed samples. PAR% of increased BP seemed to be the most important factors which might lead to renal dysfunction.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
