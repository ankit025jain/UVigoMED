{"id":75561,"title":"[The involvement of hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide and its precursor in Alzheimer pathogenesis].","abstract":"Hippocampal cholinergic neruostimulating peptide (HCNP) induces acethylcholine synthesis in the adult hippocampus of mice via increasing the amount of cholineacethyl transferase. The precursor protein of HCNP (HCNP-pp), composed of 186 amino acids, is a multifunctional protein, such as c-Raf kinase inhibitory protein and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein. In the adult hippocampus, HCNP-pp co-localizes in presynapse terminals with non-phosphorylated collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP)-2, and might play a crucial role in hippocampal neuronal activity. The quantitative alteration of HCNP-pp might be related to the phosphorylation of CRMP-2. The expression of HCNP-pp mRNA is decreased in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of CA1 from the early stage in Alzheimer's disease. The HCNP-related antigens are also deposited in the Hirano body, one locus of Alzheimer pathology. CRMP-2 is one of microtubule-associated proteins such as tau protein, and its phosphorylated form increased in the hippocampus of Alzheimer brains. HCNP and HCNP-pp might be candidates for the key molecules as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076779","annotations":[{"name":"Tau protein","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein"},{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chemical synapse","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synapse"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Cholinergic","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Transferase","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferase"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.727111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.498102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Pyramidal cell","weight":0.430843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramidal_cell"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.394448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"CA1","weight":0.046733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA1"},{"name":"Protein precursor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_precursor"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
