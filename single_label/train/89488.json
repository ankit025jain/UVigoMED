{"id":89488,"title":"Successful replantation of an amputated penis: a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Amputation of the penis is a rare traumatic injury reported from various parts of the world as isolated cases. A complete reconstruction of all penile structures should be attempted in one stage which provides the best chance for full rehabilitation of the patient.We report the case of a 35-year-old Berber man who was admitted at the Emergency Department for incomplete criminal amputation of his penis, which was successfully reattached by using a macrosurgical technique. After surgery, near-normal appearance and function including a good urine flow and absence of urethral stricture, capability of erection and near normal sensitivity, were observed.The importance of using macrosurgical reimplantation in incomplete penile amputation in order to achieve better functional and cosmetic results is discussed. In addition, we also highlight the potential anatomical role of corpus spongiosum in the arterial and venous blood supply to the penis.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716477","annotations":[{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.730161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.695321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.6415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.469426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.429846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.389465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Corpus spongiosum penis","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_spongiosum_penis"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Urine flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine_flow_rate"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"}]}
