{"id":15400,"title":"Cytokine response to selected MTB antigens in Ghanaian TB patients, before and at 2 weeks of anti-TB therapy is characterized by high expression of IFN-? and Granzyme B and inter- individual variation.","abstract":"There has been a long held belief that patients with drug-susceptible TB are non-infectious after two weeks of therapy. Recent microbiological and epidemiological evidence has challenged this dogma, however, the nature of the Mtb-specific cellular immune response during this period has not been adequately investigated. This knowledge could be exploited in the development of immunological biomarkers of early treatment response.Cellular response to four Mtb infection phase-dependent antigens, ESAT-6/CFP-10 fusion protein and three DosR encoded proteins (Rv1733c, Rv2029c, Rv2628) were evaluated in a Ghanaian TB cohort (n=20) before and after 2Â weeks of anti TB therapy. After 6-days in vitro stimulation, Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) culture supernatant was harvested and the concentration of IFN-?, Granzyme B, IL-10, IL-17, sIL2R? and TNF-? were determined in a 6-plex Luminex assay. Frequencies of IFN-??+?CD4 and CD8 T cells were also determined in an intracellular cytokine assay.All antigens induced higher levels of IFN-?, followed by Granzyme B, TNF-? and IL-17 and low levels of IL-10 and sIL-2R-? in PBMC before treatment and after 2 weeks of treatment. Median cytokine levels of IFN-?, Granzyme B, IL-17 and sIL-2R-? increased during week two, but it was significant for only Rv1733-specific production of Granzyme B (P = 0. 013). The median frequency of antigen specific IFN-? + CD4 T cells increased at week two; however, only the increase in the ESAT-6/CFP-10-specific response was significant (P = 0. 0008). In contrast, the median frequency of ESAT-6/CFP-10- specific IFN-? + CD8 T cell responses declined during week two (P = 0. 0024). Additionally, wide inter-individual variation with three distinct patterns were observed; increase in all cytokine levels, decrease in all cytokine levels and fluctuating cytokine levels after 2 weeks of treatment.The second week of effective chemotherapy was characterized by a general increase in cytokine response to Mtb-specific antigens suggestive of an improvement in cellular response with therapy. However, the wide inter-individual variation observed would limit the utility of cytokine biomarkers during this period.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
