{"id":66511,"title":"MR-detectable metabolic consequences of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition.","abstract":"Metabolic reprogramming is increasingly being viewed as a hallmark of cancer. Accordingly, metabolic readouts can serve as biomarkers of response to therapy. The goal of this study was to investigate some of the MRS-detectable metabolic consequences of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition. We investigated PC3 prostate cancer, MCF-7 breast cancer and A375 melanoma cells, and determined that, consistent with previous studies, MRS-detectable levels of phosphocholine decreased significantly in all cell lines (to 63%, 50% and 18% of the control, respectively) following MEK inhibition with U0126. This effect was mediated by a decrease in the expression of choline kinase ?, the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of choline. In contrast, the impact of MEK inhibition on glycolysis was cell line dependent. A375 cells, which express mutant BRAF, demonstrated significant decreases in glucose uptake (to 36% of control) and lactate production (to 42% of control) in line with positron emission tomography data. In contrast, in PC3 and MCF-7 cells, increases in glucose uptake (to 198% and 192% of control, respectively) and lactate production (to 177% and 212% of control, respectively) were observed, in line with a previous hyperpolarized (13) C MRS study. This effect is probably mediated by the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway and AMP-activated protein kinase. Our findings demonstrate the value of translatable non-invasive MRS methods for the provision of information on cellular metabolism as an indication of the activation of potential feedback loops following MEK inhibition.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24706368","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission
