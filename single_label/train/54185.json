{"id":54185,"title":"Polycystic ovary syndrome and low-grade inflammation with special reference to YKL-40.","abstract":"To evaluate the plasma level of YKL-40 in a Danish polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) population and to investigate whether YKL-40 is associated with CVD risk factors such as waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), insulin resistance (IR), fasting glucose, fasting insulin, blood lipids and CRP.Cross-sectional study.Gynecological clinics at three Danish University Hospitals.One hundred seventy-one premenopausal women with PCOS recruited consecutively from April 2010 to February 2012. PCOS was diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria.Plasma level of YKL-40 in four phenotypes of PCOS defined by BMI and IR.No statistically significant difference was observed in the plasma level of YKL-40 across the four BMI/IR-phenotypes. Positive associations were observed between YKL-40 and BMI, total and free testosterone, triglycerides, and CRP. Total and free testosterone were independent predictors of YKL-40.YKL-40, the marker of low-grade inflammation is not increased in women with PCOS.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471491","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.88878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.846737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.803731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.714865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.713397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.698359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.66441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.585386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.537613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.470625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.368405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.0460588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Rotterdam","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"}]}
