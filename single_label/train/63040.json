{"id":63040,"title":"Rapid exclusion of the diagnosis of immune HIT by AcuStar HIT and heparin-induced multiple electrode aggregometry.","abstract":"Accurate diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is essential but remains challenging. We have previously demonstrated, in a retrospective study, the usefulness of the combination of the 4Ts score, AcuStar HIT and heparin-induced multiple electrode aggregometry (HIMEA) with optimized thresholds.We aimed at exploring prospectively the performances of our optimized diagnostic algorithm on suspected HIT patients. The secondary objective is to evaluate performances of AcuStar HIT-Ab (PF4-H) in comparison with the clinical outcome.116 inpatients with clinically suspected immune HIT were included. Our optimized diagnostic algorithm was applied to each patient. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV) of the overall diagnostic strategy as well as AcuStar HIT-Ab (at manufacturer's thresholds and at our thresholds) were calculated using clinical diagnosis as the reference.Among 116 patients, 2 patients had clinically-diagnosed HIT. These 2 patients were positive on AcuStar HIT-Ab, AcuStar HIT-IgG and HIMEA. Using our optimized algorithm, all patients were correctly diagnosed. AcuStar HIT-Ab at our cut-off (>9.41 U/mL) and at manufacturer's cut-off (>1.00 U/mL) showed both a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 99.1% and 90.4%, respectively.The combination of the 4Ts score, the HemosILÂ® AcuStar HIT and HIMEA with optimized thresholds may be useful for the rapid and accurate exclusion of the diagnosis of immune HIT.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485951","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.757118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.412242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.317323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Net present value","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Pay-per-view","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Platelet factor 4","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_factor_4"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"},{"name":"4-H","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-H"},{"name":"Medical algorithm","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_algorithm"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
