{"id":23590,"title":"Recurrent melioidosis in the Darwin Prospective Melioidosis Study: improving therapies mean that relapse cases are now rare.","abstract":"The Darwin Prospective Melioidosis Study has documented 785 melioidosis cases over 23 years. Recurrent melioidosis occurred in 39/679 (5.7%) patients surviving initial infection; 29 patients suffered relapse of the original infection, and 10 presented with a new Burkholderia pseudomallei infection. With improved therapy, relapse has become rare in recent years.
