{"id":10094,"title":"Functional adaptation of bovine mesenteric lymphatic vessels to mesenteric venous hypertension.","abstract":"Lymph flow is the primary mechanism for returning interstitial fluid to the blood circulation. Currently, the adaptive response of lymphatic vessels to mesenteric venous hypertension is not known. This study sought to determine the functional responses of postnodal mesenteric lymphatic vessels. We surgically occluded bovine mesenteric veins to create mesenteric venous hypertension to elevate mesenteric lymph flow. Three days after surgery, postnodal mesenteric lymphatic vessels from mesenteric venous hypertension (MVH; n = 7) and sham surgery (Sham; n = 6) group animals were evaluated and compared. Contraction frequency (MVH: 2.98 ± 0.75 min(-1); Sham: 5.42 ± 0.81 min(-1)) and fractional pump flow (MVH: 1.14 ± 0.30 min(-1); Sham: 2.39 ± 0.32 min(-1)) were significantly lower in the venous occlusion group. These results indicate that postnodal mesenteric lymphatic vessels adapt to mesenteric venous hypertension by reducing intrinsic contractile activity.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671245","annotations":[{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.816901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.642332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.606658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.563323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.515965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.455767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.337602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0884832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Sham surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sham_surgery"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Flux","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"}]}
