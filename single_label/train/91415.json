{"id":91415,"title":"Multiple volar dislocations of the carpometacarpal joints with an associated fracture of the first metacarpal base.","abstract":"Multiple volar dislocations of carpometacarpal (CMC) joints are uncommon and have been reported rarely. A 25 years old male presented with injury to his left hand 6 days following a road traffic accident. Clinical examination revealed gross swelling of the hand and diffuse tenderness over the carpometacarpal area. His radiographs of the hand showed volar dislocation of the second, third and fourth CMC joints in association with an extra-articular fracture of the base of thumb metacarpal. He was treated by open reduction and percutaneous fixation using Kirschner wires. The functional results were excellent at one year follow-up.
