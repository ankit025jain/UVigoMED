{"id":79192,"title":"Effect of duration of denervation on outcomes of ansa-recurrent laryngeal nerve reinnervation.","abstract":"To investigate the efficacy of laryngeal reinnervation with ansa cervicalis among unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) patients with different denervation durations.We retrospectively reviewed 349 consecutive UVFP cases of delayed ansa cervicalis to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) anastomosis. Potential influencing factors were analyzed in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Stratification analysis performed was aimed at one of the identified significant variables: denervation duration.Videostroboscopy, perceptual evaluation, acoustic analysis, maximum phonation time (MPT), and laryngeal electromyography (EMG) were performed preoperatively and postoperatively. Gender, age, preoperative EMG status and denervation duration were analyzed in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Stratification analysis was performed on denervation duration, which was divided into three groups according to the interval between RLN injury and reinnervation: group A, 6 to 12 months; group B, 12 to 24 months; and group C,?> 24 months.Age, preoperative EMG, and denervation duration were identified as significant variables in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Stratification analysis on denervation duration showed significant differences between group A and C and between group B and C (P < 0.05)-but showed no significant difference between group A and B (P > 0.05) with regard to parameters overall grade, jitter, shimmer, noise-to-harmonics ratio, MPT, and postoperative EMG. In addition, videostroboscopic and laryngeal EMG data, perceptual and acoustic parameters, and MPT values were significantly improved postoperatively in each denervation duration group (P < 0.01).Although delayed laryngeal reinnervation is proved valid for UVFP, surgical outcome is better if the procedure is performed within 2 years after nerve injury than that over 2 years.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
