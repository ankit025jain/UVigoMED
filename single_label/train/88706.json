{"id":88706,"title":"Diné (Navajo) parents' and community leaders' perceptions of agriculture-related injury risk to youth: a social narrative.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to provide a formative needs assessment of Diné (Navajo) parents for the prevention of childhood injuries resulting from livestock and horses. The research objectives were to identify parents' perceived livestock and horse related injury risks to Diné children and describe Diné community stakeholder input on prevention interventions for reducing injury risks to children associated with livestock and horse related activities on farms or ranches. The assessment used a survey constructed of closed and open-response questions to gauge Diné farmers' and ranchers' perceptions of injury risks to children who live or work on agricultural operations. Additional questions were asked to gauge Diné acceptance of an online training program as a prevention intervention to reduce livestock and horse related injuries to children. A total of 96 individuals agreed to participate in the survey and provided usable responses. A total of 53.2% (f = 50) of participants were female. Sixty-three percent of participants (f = 58) perceived that youth who work with intact male livestock were at high risk for injury. A total of 25 individuals perceived that youth who ride horses without equestrian helmets were at high risk for injury. Approximately 96% (f = 89) of those surveyed agreed or strongly agreed that they would use an online training program to promote agricultural health and safety for Diné youth. When participants were asked if there were safety issues associated with having youth working on a farm or ranch, a very large portion felt that the biggest issue was a lack of education and instruction from elders. A recommendation for an injury prevention practice included developing a user-friendly online network, giving parents and community leaders access to resources to assist in educating youth in local agricultural traditions integrated with safety training.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804462","annotations":[{"name":"Livestock","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.715417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Equestrianism","weight":0.692984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.626731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Horse","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"},{"name":"Ranch","weight":0.543733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.492413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.387497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Narrative","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.239847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Navajo people","weight":0.0389337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_people"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Desegregation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desegregation"},{"name":"Helmet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet"},{"name":"Metanarrative","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metanarrative"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Stakeholder (corporate)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)"},{"name":"Narrow gauge railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow_gauge_railway"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Injury prevention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_prevention"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
