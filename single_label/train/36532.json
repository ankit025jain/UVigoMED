{"id":36532,"title":"Truncal valve repair using autologous pericardial patch augmentation.","abstract":"A 35-month-old boy with severe truncal valve regurgitation underwent successful repair by tricuspidization using raphe slicing and an extension technique with glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium. His truncal valve regurgitation improved from severe to mild 5 years postoperatively. Tricuspidization using raphe slicing and valve extension with autologous pericardium might be one of the alternatives for truncal valve regurgitation with a quadricuspid valve.
