{"id":77218,"title":"Mitral valve prolapse and electrolyte abnormality: a dangerous combination for ventricular arrhythmias.","abstract":"A 27-year-old woman with a history of bileaflet mitral valve prolapse and moderate mitral regurgitation presented to our emergency with untractable polymorphic wide complex tachycardia and unstable haemodynamics. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation, return of spontaneous circulation was achieved 30 min later. Her post-resuscitation ECG showed a prolonged QT interval which progressively normalised over the same day. Her laboratory investigations revealed hypocalcaemia while other electrolytes were within normal limits. A diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmia secondary to structural heart disease further precipitated by hypocalcaemia was made. Further hospital stay did not reveal a recurrence of prolonged QT interval or other arrhythmias except for an episode of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. However, the patient suffered diffuse hypoxic brain encephalopathy secondary to prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827670","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Hypocalcaemia","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocalcaemia"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.85513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Electrolyte","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Mitral valve prolapse","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve_prolapse"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Ventricular tachycardia","weight":0.783059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_tachycardia"},{"name":"Mitral regurgitation","weight":0.776726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_regurgitation"},{"name":"Long QT syndrome","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_QT_syndrome"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.756096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.737674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Valvular heart disease","weight":0.610781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valvular_heart_disease"},{"name":"QT interval","weight":0.560555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_interval"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.523203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.506654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.404565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.236089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.133549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Medical laboratory","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
