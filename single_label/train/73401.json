{"id":73401,"title":"The growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effect of deferoxamine combined with arsenic trioxide on HL-60 xenografts in nude mice.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to investigate the growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effect of deferoxamine (DFO) combined with arsenic trioxide (ATO) on the human HL-60 xenografts in nude mice and its mechanism.The highly tumorigenic leukemia cell line HL-60 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice to establish a human leukemia xenograft model. The HL-60 xenograft nude mice models were randomly divided into four groups: control (Normal saline, NS), 50mg/kg DFO, 3mg/kg ATO, the combined treatment (50mg/kg DFO+1.5mg/kg ATO) once HL-60 cells were inoculated. Tumor sizes, growth curves, inhibitory rates, cell apoptosis, and the expression of apoptosis related markers were measured to evaluate the tumor growth.Xenografted tumors were observed in all nude mice since the 5th day of inoculation. The inhibitory rates of tumor weight were 2.67%, 10.69%, and 25.57% in DFO, ATO and combination therapy groups, respectively. The combination of DFO with ATO induces significantly more tumor cell apoptosis than either agent alone (p<0.05). The expression of NF-?Bp65 and survivin proteins decreased significantly while the expression of Caspase-3 and Bax increased in the combination therapy group (p<0.05). Double immunofluorescence for Caspase-3 and NF?Bp65 demonstrated an inverse relationship between Caspase-3-positive areas and NF?Bp65-positive areas, as well as the co-localization of Bax and survivin in xenografted tumor cells.Combination of DFO and ATO has synergistic effects on tumor growth inhibition and apoptosis-inducing in vivo with no significant side effects. The DFO and ATO can up-regulate the expression of Caspase-3 and Bax, and down-regulate the expression of NF-?Bp65 and survivin, especially for their combination.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908354","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.895066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Arsenic trioxide","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic_trioxide"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.756175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Deferoxamine","weight":0.742865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferoxamine"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.73601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Nude mouse","weight":0.717978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Arsenic","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.596476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.563739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.490028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.446933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.426811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.155832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.0903151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"HL60","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HL60"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Support group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_group"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"}]}
