{"id":14022,"title":"Comparison of oral and intramuscular recombinant canine distemper vaccination in African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus).","abstract":"A series of three doses of recombinant canary-pox-vectored canine distemper virus vaccine was administered at 1-mo intervals, orally (n = 8) or intramuscularly (n = 13), to 21 previously unvaccinated juvenile African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) at the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo. Titers were measured by serum neutralization at each vaccination and at intervals over a period of 3.5-21.5 mo after the initial vaccination. All postvaccination titers were negative for orally vaccinated animals at all sampling time points. Of the animals that received intramuscular vaccinations, 100% had presumed protective titers by the end of the course of vaccination, but only 50% of those sampled at 6.5 mo postvaccination had positive titers. None of the three animals sampled at 21.5 mo postvaccination had positive titers.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450046","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Canine distemper","weight":0.765787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_distemper"},{"name":"Lycaon pictus","weight":0.730444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycaon_pictus"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.606847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Wildlife","weight":0.546869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.478664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Zoo","weight":0.422886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.36474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"The Bronx","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx"},{"name":"Bronx Zoo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_Zoo"},{"name":"Lycaon (Arcadia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycaon_(Arcadia)"},{"name":"Sampling rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_rate"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"}]}
