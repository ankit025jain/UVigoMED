{"id":43549,"title":"[Hemorrhoidal disease accompanied by anal prolapsus and its treatment methods].","abstract":"The objective of this research is to evaluate specifications of the surgery, its post-operative period and complications in patients with traditional hemorrhoidectomy which is a procedure performed by using a linear stapler along with a circular resection of prolapsed mucosal and sub-mucosal layers of lower rectal ampulla with the utilization of Longo technique. The study was conducted with the participation of 398 patients with the hemorrhoidal disease accompanied by anal prolapsus of which 338 (84%) were composed of males and 65 (16%) of females. Out of 398 patients, 308 (77%) underwent stapler hemorrohidectomy using linear stapler, 74 (19%) patients had conventional hemorrhoidectomy with the utilization of electric coagulation and 16 (4%) of them received circular hemorroidopexy using Longo technique. According to the data obtained during this research linear stapler use in the treatment of hemorroidal desease, accompanied by anal prolapses is an effective and technically simple solution to the problem. This method is implemented quickly, allows to cover greater part of abnormally changed cavernous tissue and conduct persist lifting of anal canal mucosal layer. It is also a safe method without any disease relapses.
