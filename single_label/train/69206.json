{"id":69206,"title":"The diagnosis and classification of microscopic polyangiitis.","abstract":"Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA) is a small vessel vasculitis. The disease is defined by the 2012 revised Chapel Hill Consensus Conference Nomenclature of Vasculitides [1] as necrotizing vasculitis, with few or no immune deposits, predominantly affecting small vessels (i.e. capillaries, venules, or arterioles). Necrotizing arteritis involving small and medium arteries may be present. Necrotizing glomerulonephritis is very common. Pulmonary capillaritis often occurs. Granulomatous inflammation is absent. MPA belongs to the ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV). ANCA in MPA are predominantly directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) but may, in a minority of patients, be directed against proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA). Not all patients, however, have ANCA. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) belongs to the anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides. MPA is clinically characterized by small-vessel vasculitis primarily affecting the kidneys and the lungs but other organs may be involved as well. Renal involvement, which can be the only manifestation, is clinically apparent as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and histopathologically as pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. ANCA in MPA are mainly directed to myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA). Besides their diagnostic significance, MPO-ANCA appear pathogenic in MPA. Rituximab with steroids is at least as effective as cyclophosphamide with steroids for induction of remission.
