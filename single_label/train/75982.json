{"id":75982,"title":"Is there such a thing as \"generalized\" epilepsy?","abstract":"The distinction between generalized and partial epilepsies is probably one, if not the most, pregnant assertions in modern epileptology. Both absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the prototypic seizures found in generalized epilepsies, are classically seen as the result of a rapid, synchronous recruitment of neuronal networks resulting in impairment of consciousness and/or convulsive semiology. The term generalized also refers to electroencephalographic presentation, with bilateral, synchronous activity, such as the classical 3 Hz spike and wave discharges of typical absence epilepsy. However, findings obtained from electrophysiological and functional imaging studies over the last few years, contradict this view, showing a rather focal onset for most of the so-called generalized seizure types. Therefore, we ask here the question whether \"generalized epilepsy\" does indeed exist.
