{"id":44736,"title":"Comparison the efficacy of intermediate dose argon plasma coagulation versus hemoclip for upper gastrointestinal non-variceal bleeding.","abstract":"Endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) and hemoclip were used for the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers. There are wide ranges of hemostatic doses (power and flow) of APC used in previous studies. The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of \"intermediate dose\" APC compared to hemoclips for hemostasis from bleeding peptic ulcer.The present study was designed as a retrospective study using historical controls. One hundred and ninety-four consecutive upper GI bleeding patients with bleeding visible vessel lesions were treated with either APC or hemoclips. There are 110 patients received APC treatment and 84 patients received hemoclip hemostasis. The main outcome measurements were one week rebleeding rate, one month rebleeding rate, surgery, morality, amount of blood transfusion and durations of hospital stay.There were no significant differences between the two groups in 1 week rebleeding rate (1.8% vs. 2.4%, p = 1.0), 1 month rebleeding rate (0% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.433), mortality, surgery and amount of blood transfusion (2.67 +/- 3.27 vs. 3.04 +/- 2.75 units, p = 0.322). However, the hospital stay was longer in hemoclip group (5.38 +/- 6.76 vs. 8.49 +/- 11.19 days p = 0.011).APC and hemoclip are with different hemostatic mechanisms, but the hemostatic outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups. APC is an effective, safe, and easily applicable endoscopic hemostatic modality as hemoclip for patients with non-variceal bleeding.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719941","annotations":[{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Argon plasma coagulation","weight":0.824248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon_plasma_coagulation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.684428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Upper gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Argon","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.588503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.574945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Antihemorrhagic","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihemorrhagic"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Adenomatous polyposis coli","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenomatous_polyposis_coli"},{"name":"Morality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
