{"id":35096,"title":"The function of elastic fibers in the arteries: beyond elasticity.","abstract":"The main components of elastic fibers, elastin and fibrillin-containing microfibrils play a structural and mechanical role in the arteries and their essential function is to provide elasticity and resilience to the tissues. However, through control of the quiescent contractile phenotype of arterial smooth muscle cells, elastin also acts as an autocrine factor and, via the binding of 'latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-? binding protein (LTBP) - latency-associated peptide (LAP) - TGF-?' complexes, fibrillins regulate the activation and availability of TGF-?s. These recent discoveries are detailed in this review.
