{"id":52188,"title":"Low-dose interleukin 2 in patients with type 1 diabetes: a phase 1/2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","abstract":"An improper balance of regulatory/effector T (Treg/Teff) cells is central to the development of autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes. We previously showed that low-dose interleukin 2 (IL2) induced Treg cell expansion and activation and clinical improvement in patients with hepatitis-C-virus-induced vasculitis. We aimed to establish which low doses of IL2 would be safe and induce Treg cells in patients with type 1 diabetes, considering that: (1) type 1 diabetes might be linked to alteration of the IL2/IL2R activation pathway; (2) activation of pathogenic Teff cells by IL2 could exacerbate disease; and (3) the safety of low-dose IL2 is not known in type 1 diabetes.Six patients were assigned to each group between June 1, 2011, and Feb 3, 2012. IL2 was well tolerated at all doses, with no serious adverse events. However, there was a dose-response association for non-serious adverse events during the treatment phase (days 1-6); one patient in the placebo group, three patients in the 0.33 MIU group, five patients in the 1 MIU group, and six patients in the 3 MIU group had non-serious adverse events. The most common adverse events in the treatment phase were injection-site reaction (no patients with placebo vs three patients with 0.33 MIU and 1 MIU vs two patients with 3 MIU) and influenza-like syndrome (no patients with placebo vs one patient with 0.33 MIU and 1 MIU vs four patients with 3 MIU). After the treatment phase, adverse events did not differ between groups. IL2 did not induce deleterious changes in glucose-metabolism variables. IL2 induced a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of Treg cells, significant at all doses compared with placebo (placebo mean increase 0.5% [SD 0.4]; 0.33 MIU 2.8% [1.2], p=0.0039; 1 MIU 3.9% [1.8], p=0.0039; 3 MIU 4.8% [1.9] p=0.0039).We have defined a well-tolerated and immunologically effective dose range of IL2 for application to type 1 diabetes therapy and prevention, which could be relevant to other disorders in which a Treg cell increase would be desirable.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622415","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.82664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.513105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.336785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.218235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.20913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"IL-2 receptor","weight":0.169595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL-2_receptor"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.108815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0509955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Eragrostis tef","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eragrostis_tef"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.0203168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
