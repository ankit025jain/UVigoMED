{"id":24462,"title":"Targeting toll-like receptor signaling as a novel approach to prevent ocular infectious diseases.","abstract":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role in the innate immune response to invading pathogens. Thus, their discovery has opened up a wide range of therapeutic possibilities for various infectious and inflammatory diseases. In the last several years, extensive research efforts have provided a considerable wealth of information on the expression and function of TLRs in the eye, with significant implications for better understanding of pathogenesis of infectious eye diseases affecting the cornea, uvea, and the retina. In this review, by using bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis as examples, we discuss the possibilities of targeting TLR signaling for the prevention or treatment of ocular infectious diseases.
