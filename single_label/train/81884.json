{"id":81884,"title":"The role of bisphosphonates in medical oncology and their association with jaw bone necrosis.","abstract":"Bisphosphonates, synthetic analogues to inorganic pyrophosphates found in the bone matrix, inhibit bone resorption. Bisphosphonates and their related effects on the jaw have been established since 2001. The pathogenesis of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is multifactorial and still under investigation. Currently, drugs with mechanisms of action involving remodeling suppression, osteoclast depression, and decreasing angiogenesis are under investigation for causing BRONJ-like symptoms. Further studies are needed to determine the effective length of use of biphosponates and the efficacy of drug holidays to prevent BRONJ.
