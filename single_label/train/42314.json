{"id":42314,"title":"[Outcomes after surgery for refractory constipation patients complicated with megacolon].","abstract":"To explore the efficacy of different procedures for refractory constipation complicated with megacolon.Clinical data of 112 patients of refractory constipation complicated with megacolon undergoing surgery in our institute from June 2007 to January 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Of these 112 patients, the duration of constipation ranged from 4 to 22 years. Seventy-four patients had previous abdominal operations. Surgical procedures: (1)Jinling procedure (subtotal colectomy plus ascending colorectal posterior wall side-to-side anastomosis, n=81), including 24 laparoscopy-assisted procedures, 18 terminal ileostomies. (2)total colectomy plus ileorectal side-to-side anastomosis(n=18). (3)total colectomy plus end ileostomy, and ileorectal posterior wall side-to-side anastomosis 6 months later(n=13). The end ileostomy was reversed 6 months after operation.The successful rate was 100%, and no surgery-related deaths were found. Postoperative complications included early diarrhea (90 cases, 80.4%), anal pain and incomplete evacuation (22 cases, 19.6%), urinary retention within 24-48 h after catheter removal (16 cases, 14.2%), anastomosis bleeding (9 cases, 8.0%), anastomosis leakage (6 cases, 5.4%), and intestinal obstruction (15 cases, 13.4%). Six patients with intestinal obstruction underwent adhesiolysis, and others were managed by conservative therapy. At the postoperative follow-up at 6 months, the Wexner constipation score was significantly reduced (5.8-8.3 vs. 21.4-28.7, P<0.01), and malnutrition improved as well.Surgical intervention results in good efficacy for refractory constipation complicated with megacolon.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859953","annotations":[{"name":"Ileostomy","weight":0.910318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileostomy"},{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.792133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Urinary retention","weight":0.729617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_retention"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.702662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.700895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.684672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.659278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.650959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Megacolon","weight":0.446942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacolon"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.413345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.256906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0880793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"List of surgical procedures","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Nanjing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
