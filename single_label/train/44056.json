{"id":44056,"title":"Phylogenetic analyses of HBV pre-s/s genes in mother-child pairs with long-term infection by presumed vertical transmission.","abstract":"Vertical transmission from mother to child, the main route of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the East Asia, is considered one of the most important predictors for the response to antiviral therapies as well as its complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, it is critical in both etiologic and prognostic aspects to confirm whether or not chronic HBV infection is acquired vertically. This study investigated whether mother-to-child infection could be proved by the phylogenetic analyses of HBV pre-S/S genes ever since several decades have elapsed in mother-child pairs with presumed vertical transmission. The pre-S and S regions of HBVs were compared and analyzed phylogenetically in a total of 36 adults (18 mother-child pairs) with chronic HBV infection. All of the isolates of HBV were genotype C and serotype adr. The divergence between mothers and offsprings was 0 to 1.5%. Phylogenetic trees revealed that 17 of 18 pairs (94%) with presumed vertical transmission were grouped into the same cluster. Vertical transmission from mother to child could be strongly suggested even in adults with a history of several decades of HBV infection using the phylogenetic analyses of pre-S and S genes.
