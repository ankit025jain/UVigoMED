{"id":80612,"title":"DNA repair pathways in trypanosomatids: from DNA repair to drug resistance.","abstract":"All living organisms are continuously faced with endogenous or exogenous stress conditions affecting genome stability. DNA repair pathways act as a defense mechanism, which is essential to maintain DNA integrity. There is much to learn about the regulation and functions of these mechanisms, not only in human cells but also equally in divergent organisms. In trypanosomatids, DNA repair pathways protect the genome against mutations but also act as an adaptive mechanism to promote drug resistance. In this review, we scrutinize the molecular mechanisms and DNA repair pathways which are conserved in trypanosomatids. The recent advances made by the genome consortiums reveal the complete genomic sequences of several pathogens. Therefore, using bioinformatics and genomic sequences, we analyze the conservation of DNA repair proteins and their key protein motifs in trypanosomatids. We thus present a comprehensive view of DNA repair processes in trypanosomatids at the crossroads of DNA repair and drug resistance.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600040","annotations":[{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Conserved sequence","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.64932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.356946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"List of distinct cell types in the adult human body","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body"},{"name":"Structural motif","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_motif"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Plant defense against herbivory","weight":0.176385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_defense_against_herbivory"},{"name":"Conservation biology","weight":0.171192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.170811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Trypanosomatid","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosomatid"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Consortium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium"},{"name":"Divergent evolution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_evolution"}]}
