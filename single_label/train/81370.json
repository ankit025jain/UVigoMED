{"id":81370,"title":"Lingual orthodontics as an aesthetic resource in the preparation of orthodontic/surgical treatment.","abstract":"The lingual technique was introduced in the late '70s and, just like orthodontics, it has developed significantly in the past few years. Adult and young adult have been attracted to such alternative aesthetic treatment. Despite their need of orthodontic treatment, they want to have an aesthetic alternative, as \"invisible\" as possible--something that can be achieved with the lingual technique. Nevertheless, many treatment or re-treatment cases also demand correction through orthognathic surgery, a process which is nowadays much simpler and considered an effective auxiliary method for the malocclusion correction. Having posed that, this study aims to show correction of malocclusion and discrepancy between dental arches through lingual orthodontic technique associated to orthognathic surgery. This study shows that it is possible to provide the patient who suffers frJom malocclusion with proper correction, achieving the desired aesthetics by using lingual braces and pe?forming lingual orthognathic surgery.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25109056","annotations":[{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.564199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Dental braces","weight":0.517546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.240041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.239504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Orthognathic surgery","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthognathic_surgery"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.112553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dental arches","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_arches"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Invisibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisibility"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
