{"id":30713,"title":"[Medical analytical toxicology in Poland in year 2012].","abstract":"There are 12 centers of acute poisoning treatment and 9 round the clock toxicological laboratories. Most of the laboratories access evidence of activity run by National Clinical Toxicology Consultant. The paper presents actual status of medical toxicology laboratories in Poland and summarizes activity of the laboratories in the year 2012. In 2012 toxicological laboratories reported 113,719 assays. There were diagnosed 63.8% men and 34.8% women. The toxicological laboratories determine most substances and markers of exposition to chemical compounds important for diagnosis and treatment of acute poisonings (i.e. ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, acetaminophen, salicylates, anticonvulsants, carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin). There is not possible to determine heavy metals, all medicines and \"designed\" drugs of abuse in all laboratories. Limited access to reference methods, that enable to confirm results obtained by screening methods (immunological cassette and strip tests) is also a problem.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466680","annotations":[{"name":"Ethylene glycol","weight":0.935706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Methanol","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Heavy metal (chemistry)","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Salicylic acid","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Ethylene","weight":0.691293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Medical toxicology","weight":0.658078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_toxicology"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.593778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.556281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.554997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Diol","weight":0.55051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diol"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.543733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Antidote","weight":0.491761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidote"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.449015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.411136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.310915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.278822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Clock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock"},{"name":"Compact Cassette","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Cassette"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
