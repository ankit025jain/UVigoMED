{"id":22638,"title":"Coverage of diarrhoea-associated Escherichia coli isolates from different origins with two types of phage cocktails.","abstract":"Eighty-nine T4-like phages from our phage collection were tested against four collections of childhood diarrhoea-associated Escherichia coli isolates representing different geographical origins (Mexico versus?Bangladesh), serotypes (69 O, 27 H serotypes), pathotypes (ETEC, EPEC, EIEC, EAEC, VTEC, Shigella), epidemiological settings (community and hospitalized diarrhoea) and years of isolation. With a cocktail consisting of 3 to 14 T4-like phages, we achieved 54% to 69% coverage against predominantly EPEC isolates from Mexico, 30% to 53% against mostly ETEC isolates from a prospective survey in Bangladesh, 24% to 61% against a mixture of pathotypes isolated from hospitalized children in Bangladesh, and 60% coverage against Shigella isolates. In comparison a commercial Russian phage cocktail containing a complex mixture of many different genera of coliphages showed 19%, 33%, 50% and 90% coverage, respectively, against the four above-mentioned collections. Few O serotype-specific phages and no broad-host range phages were detected in our T4-like phage collection. Interference phenomena between the phage isolates were observed when constituting larger phage cocktails. Since the coverage of a given T4-like phage cocktail differed with geographical area and epidemiological setting, a phage composition adapted to a local situation is needed for phage therapy approaches against E.?coli pathogens.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528873","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.891044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Bangladesh","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.669507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.614744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.484672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Shigella","weight":0.442693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigella"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.323648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Phage therapy","weight":0.222756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_therapy"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.17344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Bacteriophage","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.13935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"VTEC","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTEC"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.0210801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Cocktail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Geographic coordinate system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Coverage (album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverage_(album)"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Unresolved complex mixture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unresolved_complex_mixture"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket_in_South_Africa_from_1971_to_1981"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"T4 (Channel 4)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T4_(Channel_4)"}]}
