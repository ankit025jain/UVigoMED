{"id":85830,"title":"PET/CT assessment of neuroendocrine tumors of the lung with special emphasis on bronchial carcinoids.","abstract":"Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) arise from bronchial mucosal cells known as enterochromaffin cells which are part of the diffuse neuroendocrine system. The pathological spectrum of pNETs ranges from low-/intermediate-grade neoplasms such as bronchial carcinoids (BCs), also known as typical or atypical carcinoids, to high-grade neoplasms as large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and small-cell lung cancer. The tumor biology of pNETs still represents a matter of open debate. The distinct features among the different pNETs include not only their pathologic characteristics but also their clinical behavior, epidemiology, treatment, and prognosis. In this sense, a correct pathological identification in the preoperative setting is a key element for planning the best strategy of care in pNETs and especially in BCs. Controversial results have been reported on the diagnostic accuracy of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography or positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-18-FDG PET or PET/CT) in BCs. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence supporting the use of PET with somatostatin analogues (DOTA-TOC, DOTA-NOC, or DOTA-TATE) labeled with gallium-68 (Ga-68) in pNETs. Herein, we review the pertinent literature aiming to better define the current state of art of PET/CT in the detection and histological differentiation of pNETs with special emphasis on BCs.
