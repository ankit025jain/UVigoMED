{"id":3772,"title":"Low coherence interferometry approach for aiding fine needle aspiration biopsies.","abstract":"We present portable preclinical low-coherence interference (LCI) instrumentation for aiding fine needle aspiration biopsies featuring the second-generation LCI-based biopsy probe and an improved scoring algorithm for tissue differentiation. Our instrument and algorithm were tested on 38 mice with cultured tumor mass and we show the specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value of tumor detection of over 0.89, 0.88, and 0.96, respectively.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25375634","annotations":[{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.75744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.630444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.411315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Interferometry","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Optical interferometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_interferometry"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Space probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe"},{"name":"Landing Craft Infantry","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Craft_Infantry"}]}
