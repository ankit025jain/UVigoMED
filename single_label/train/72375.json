{"id":72375,"title":"Highly selective electrocoagulation therapy: an innovative treatment for lymphangioma circumscriptum.","abstract":"Lymphangioma circumscriptum (LC) is a type of microcystic lymphatic malformation involving the skin and mucosa that presents as translucent vesicles of varying size with a pink, red, or black hue. Lymphangioma circumscriptum causes not only cosmetic problems but also refractory rupture, infection, lymphorrhea, and bleeding. Various invasive methods, such as surgical excision, lasers, and sclerotherapy, have been used in the past to treat LC with varying success. Herein, we report a new treatment for the management of LC.This study reports the outcomes of 12 patients (aged 4-31 years) with LC treated by electrocoagulation using a special isolated needle. Patient demographics, lesion characteristics, radiologic findings, treatment course, and clinical responses are recorded.All 12 patients who were treated with the highly selective electrocoagulation therapy achieved near-complete clearance. Minimal intra- and postoperative sequelae were observed. The local complications included mild pain (n = 9), proliferous scarring (n = 1), and ulceration (n = 1) with no systemic side effects. The mean follow-up period was 8.25 months (3-14 months).Highly selective electrocoagulation therapy is an innovative, minimally invasive technique that seems to be safe and effective for the treatment of LC; the results from our limited study population seem promising, and the observed complications are acceptable.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24978646","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Sclerotherapy","weight":0.731172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotherapy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.711753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.627351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.458217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.174844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Vesicle (biology and chemistry)","weight":0.125212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Lymphangioma","weight":0.0506365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphangioma"},{"name":"Transparency and translucency","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Pink","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
