{"id":17117,"title":"[Evaluation of immunological efficiency induced by Campylobacter jejuni PEB1 DNA combined with PEB1 protein in mice].","abstract":"To explore the improved immunological responses induced by an amino acid ABC transporter, permease protein PEB1 DNA vaccine primer-protein boost immunization method against Campylobacter jejuni.The DNA vaccine pcDNA3.1(-)-PEB1 and protein vaccine were prepared, respectively. The female BALB/c mice were intranasally immunized with the vaccines. PBS and pcDNA3.1(-) were used as controls. The humoral and cellular immunological responses were detected in female BALB/c mice that were challenged by Campylobacter jejuni at 28 days after the final immunization.In the DNA primer-protein boost group at day 56, the stimulation index (SI) of lymphocytes was 2.625±0.275, serum IgG was (2.507±0.124) ?g/mL, IL-4 in spleen supernatant was (377.47±14.560) pg/mL, IFN-? in spleen supernatant was (258.920±13.472) pg/mL, and sIgA in genital tract was (80.351±5.769) ng/mL. All of them were significantly higher than those in controls (P<0.05). The DNA primer-protein boost vaccines induced the strongest levels of protection to BALB/c mice (91.53%).The DNA primer-protein boost immunization could induce significant protective immunity against Campylobacter jejuni challenge. It could significantly enhance both humoral and cellular immunologic responses in BALB/c mice, compared with DNA vaccine or protein vaccine immunization alone.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24909276","annotations":[{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.777236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.755792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.729883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"ATP-binding cassette transporter","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP-binding_cassette_transporter"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.581051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.555242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.550458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Campylobacter","weight":0.366559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter"},{"name":"DNA vaccination","weight":0.356338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_vaccination"},{"name":"Public Broadcasting Service","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"American Broadcasting Company","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"}]}
