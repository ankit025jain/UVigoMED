Heishunpian total alkaloids had a certain inhibitory effect on acetylcholine chloride and neostigmine methylsulfate strengthening small intestine smooth muscle movement, however, had no significantly effect on Atropine sulfate inhibiting small intestine smooth muscle movement. By HPLC analysis, benzoylaconitine, benzoylmesaconitine, benzoylhypaconitine were the main chemical constituents of Heishunpian total alkaloids.Heishunpian total alkaloids have a certain role of antidiarrheal and its mechanism may be related to antagonizing muscarinic receptors.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24956823","annotations":[{"name":"Neostigmine","weight":0.854644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neostigmine"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.830225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Acetylcholine","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine"},{"name":"Atropine","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropine"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.794399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Alkaloid","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaloid"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"High-performance liquid chromatography","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_liquid_chromatography"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.33674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.20613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.149844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Prokinetic agent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokinetic_agent"}]}
