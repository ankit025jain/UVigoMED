{"id":86320,"title":"Cx43 reverses the resistance of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells to cisplatin by inhibiting EMT.","abstract":"Cisplatin (CDDP) is one of the standard first-line chemotherapeutic agents for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Unfortunately, prolonged exposure to CDDP results in acquired resistance which prevents the successful treatment of lung cancer patients. Thus, it is necessary to explore the mechanism underlying the resistance of NSCLC to CDDP. In the present study, a CDDP-resistant human lung cancer cell line A549/CDDP was established from the parental cell line A549. The results demonstrated that A549/CDDP cells acquired an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, with morphological changes including acquisition of a spindle-like fibroblastic phenotype, downregulation of E-cadherin, upregulation of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, Snail and Slug), and increased capability of invasion and migration. Compared with A549 cells, the A549/CDDP cells showed decreased connexin43 (Cx43) expression. Overexpression of Cx43 reversed EMT and CDDP resistance in the A549/CDDP cells. Conversely, knockdown of Cx43 expression by siRNA-Cx43 initiated EMT and induced CDDP insensitivity in A549 cells. In summary, Cx43 reverses CDDP resistance in A549 CDDP-resistant cells by preventing EMT, making Cx43 a possible therapeutic target for lung cancer.
