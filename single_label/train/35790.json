It embraces a large spectrum of congenital and acquired heart diseases, which now affect the entire life span of patients from \"cradle to grave.\" One of the challenges faced by congenital cardiac anesthesiologists is reading the large amount of relevant literature from the fields of cardiology, cardiac surgery, intensive care medicine, and anesthesiology.
