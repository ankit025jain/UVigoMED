{"id":71586,"title":"Molecular targeted ?-particle therapy for oncologic applications.","abstract":"A significant challenge facing traditional cancer therapies is their propensity to significantly harm normal tissue. The recent clinical success of targeting therapies by attaching them to antibodies that are specific to tumor-restricted biomarkers marks a new era of cancer treatments.In this article, we highlight the recent developments in ?-particle therapy that have enabled investigators to exploit this highly potent form of therapy by targeting tumor-restricted molecular biomarkers.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055256","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.812086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.617115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.47488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.452868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Particle therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Exploit (computer security)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Particle physics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics"}]}
