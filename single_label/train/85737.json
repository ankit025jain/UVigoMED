{"id":85737,"title":"Frequency of Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenza in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airway disease and their sensitivity to levofloxacin.","abstract":"To determine the frequency of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and their sensitivity to levofloxacin.The cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Medicine, AbbasiShaheed Hospital, Karachi, between July 2009 and January 2010. Patients already diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and admitted with symptoms of acute exacerbation were included in the study and their sputum samples were sent for microbiological evaluation. SPSS 16 was used for statistical analysis.Of the total 105 patients in the study, 90 (85.17%) were males. Overall mean age at presentation was 62 +/- 10.2 years. S. pneumoniae was isolated from sputum culture of 33 (31.4%) patients, while 13 (12.4%) patients showed growth of H. influenzae. Out of the 33 sputum specimens of S. pneumoniae, 32 (97.0%) were sensitive to levofloxacin, while 1 (3.0%) was resistant. All the 13 isolates of H. influenzae were sensitive to levofloxacin.S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are still the most prevalent organisms isolated in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in our population. Levofloxacin is still considered a highly sensitive antibiotic against these common micro-organisms in our population, but S. pneumoniae has started developing resistance against levofloxacin. Therefore, intermittent surveillance regarding development of resistance pattern of common micro-organisms against commonly prescribed antibiotics is required.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864632","annotations":[{"name":"Haemophilus influenzae","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Levofloxacin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levofloxacin"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Sputum culture","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum_culture"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.772433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.675385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.597988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.542155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Haemophilus","weight":0.410315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.395494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.114191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Karachi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi"},{"name":"Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_exacerbation_of_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
