{"id":61717,"title":"Autoimmune neutropenia.","abstract":"Autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) is a rare entity caused by antibodies directed against neutrophil-specific antigens. It includes primary and secondary autoimmune neutropenia. Acute autoimmune neutropenia can be related to drug-induced mechanism or viral infections. Chronic autoimmune neutropenias occur in the context of autoimmune diseases, hematological malignancies, such as large granular lymphocyte leukemia, primary immune deficiency syndromes or solid tumors. The therapeutic management depends on the etiology. Granulocyte growth factor is the main therapeutic option, raising the question of their long-term utilization safety. Corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy are indicated in infection-related AIN or in case of symptomatic autoimmune disease or LGL leukemia.
