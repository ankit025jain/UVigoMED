{"id":43153,"title":"Clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic impact of colorectal cancers with NRAS mutations.","abstract":"At present, molecular markers of colorectal cancer (CRC), including KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations, and the microsatellite status are evaluated for the development of personalized treatments. However, clinicopathological and molecular characteristics and the prognostic role of NRAS mutations remain unclear. In the present study, a total of 1,304 consecutive stage 0-IV CRC tumor samples were analyzed for KRAS (exon 2, 3 and 4), NRAS (exon 2 and 3) and BRAF (exon 15) mutations. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the prognostic impact of NRAS mutations. KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations were identified in 553 (42.4%), 35 (2.7%), and 59 (4.5%) of 1,304 CRC cases, respectively. Tumors with NRAS mutations were more frequently located in the distal colorectum compared with those with KRAS or BRAF mutations. Multivariate analysis indicated that KRAS and BRAF mutations were found to be associated with poor prognosis [hazard ratio (HR)=1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-1.76 and HR=2.09; 95% CI, 1.33-3.28, respectively], whereas NRAS mutations were associated with a trend toward favorable prognosis (HR=0.53; 95% CI, 0.27-1.03). Characteristics and prognosis of CRC with NRAS mutations are different from those with KRAS or BRAF mutations.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24806883","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.83039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Microsatellite (genetics)","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(genetics)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.794957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.312081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.308774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"KRAS","weight":0.0580173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0492338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.0322457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Croatian Radiotelevision","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Radiotelevision"},{"name":"Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma_RAS_viral_oncogene_homolog"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.025403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Costa Rica","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"553","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/553"},{"name":"304","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/304"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Personalized medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"}]}
