{"id":66337,"title":"Holmium:YAG laser ablation combined intraurethral fluorouracil perfusion as treatment option for intraurethral Condyloma acuminata in men.","abstract":"Intraurethral condylomata acuminata (CA) is caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) infection which is transmitted by close physical and sexual contact. CA is often difficult to cure. There is limited research on the treatment of the patients with intraurethral CA. Here, we have reviewed our experiences on the treatment of intraurethral condylomatous with Holmium:YAG Laser ablation. A new and convenient mean of administering fluorouracil and lidocaine for the treatment of intraurethral condyloma acuminata is discussed. This study aimed to evaluate the experience and efficacy of Holmium:YAG Laser ablation with ureteroscopy and local administration of fluorouracil in the treatment of patients with intraurethral CA. The effects were investigated based on the rate of cure and relapse and the incidence of complications.The study included patients with intraurethral condylomatous who had undergone Holmium:YAG Laser ablation and intraurethral perfusion of fluorouracil. From May 2005 to October 2008, 25 patients (mean age 31.3 years, 19-63 years) with cystourethroscopy confirmed extensive lesions at the anterior urethra and biopsy of the lesions was compatible with condyloma acuminata. They all underwent Holmium:YAG Laser ablation with a transurethral Wolf 8/9.8 Fr rigid ureteroscope. And a week later, the patients initially accepted intraurethral installation of the mixture containing 1% fluorouracil and 1% tetracaine hydrochloride gel (lubricating jelly) in a volume of 20 mL. This mixture was given intraurethrally once weekly, and tip of the penis was clamped immediately to close the urethral meatus after administration by using an occlusive penile clamp and was retained for 20 minutes. Six treatments were given initially and after six weeks of rest, another cycle of six weekly treatments was given.Ureteroscopic Holmium laser ablation was successfully performed in all patients with multifocal intraurethral CA. Mean CA warts body size was 3 mm (2-8) in diameter. Mean operative time was 22.8 minutes (range 13-41). No major intraoperative complications occurred. Intraurethral installation was well tolerated, although six patients complained occasional urethral pain while urinating. Three relapses in a 2-5 weeks of follow-up underwent repeat holmium laser ablation and installation of the fluorouracil mixture. In an average of six months of follow-up, the patients have no ureteral stricture or relapse of the CA.The results of this study suggest that holmium:YAG laser ablation of the intraurethral CA combined with intraurethral perfusion of 5-fluorouracil and tetracaine hydrochloride gel mixture is an effective and safer therapy with a lower relapse rate for treatment of intraurethral CA.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721943","annotations":[{"name":"Genital wart","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genital_wart"},{"name":"Cystoscopy","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystoscopy"},{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Syphilis","weight":0.882316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis"},{"name":"Lidocaine","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine"},{"name":"Ureteroscopy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureteroscopy"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.872543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Urinary meatus","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_meatus"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Glans penis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glans_penis"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Wart","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wart"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.584805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.482633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.448766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.441444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.379473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.355957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.156906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.148263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Papilloma","weight":0.10298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilloma"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0840959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Lubricant","weight":0.0670588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubricant"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"}]}
