{"id":83892,"title":"Minimally invasive right thoracotomy approach for mitral valve surgery in patients with previous sternotomy: a single institution experience with 173 patients.","abstract":"This study presents a review of our experience with minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS) in patients with a previous cardiac procedure performed through a sternotomy over a 10-year period.From November 2003 to August 2013, 173 patients (age 61.3 ± 12.4 years) underwent reoperative MIMVS through a right minithoracotomy. Previous operations were coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 49; 28.6%), a mitral valve procedure (n = 120; 70.1%), an aortic valve procedure (n = 32; 18.7%), and other operations (n = 14; 8.1%). The mean euroSCORE was 11.2 ± 3.8. The time to redo surgery was 6.9 ± 4.2 years.Procedures were performed with central aortic cannulation in 55 patients (31.7%) and peripheral cannulation in 118 (68.3%). A transthoracic clamp was used in 58 patients (33.5%), an endoaortic balloon in 72 (41.6%), hypothermic ventricular fibrillation in 23 (13.2%), and beating heart in 20 (11.5%). Mean cardiopulmonary bypass and crossclamp times were 160 ± 58 minutes and 82 ± 49 minutes, respectively. Mitral repair was performed in 53 patients (30.6%). Forty-three patients (24.7%) had an additional cardiac procedure. Conversion to sternotomy was necessary in 2 patients (1.1%) and reoperation for bleeding in 11 patients (6.3%). Thirty-day mortality was 4.1% (n = 7). Major morbidities included stroke (n = 11; 6%) and new-onset dialysis requirement (n = 4; 2.3%). The mean blood transfusion requirement was 1.4 ± 1.1 units. Mean follow-up was 3.3 ± 2.6 years. Survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 93.1% ± 1.9%, 87.5% ± 2.7%, and 79.7% ± 3.8%, respectively.Reoperative mitral valve surgery can be safely performed through a right minithoracotomy with good early and late outcomes. The avoidance of extensive surgical dissection, optimal valve exposure, and low blood transfusion are the main advantages of this technique.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25224550","annotations":[{"name":"Thoracotomy","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ventricular fibrillation","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.752823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Median sternotomy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_sternotomy"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.672562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.584953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Fibrillation","weight":0.468355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrillation"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Clamp (tool)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamp_(tool)"}]}
