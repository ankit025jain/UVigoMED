{"id":56888,"title":"Differential expression of genes in cells cultured from juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to distinguish differences in gene expression between cells cultured from the juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork (JCTM) and those from Schlemm's canal (SC), to gain clues to differences between those cell types, and to add to our baseline knowledge of gene expression differences in these cell types for later comparison between cells from nonprimary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and POAG outflow tissues.A set of JCTM and SC cells was cultured from each of 2 donor eyes by an explant method, grown to passage 3, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were thawed, total RNA was extracted, and the probes made from total RNAs were hybridized to MICROMAX human cDNA microarray slides in 2 separate trials. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using PubMed, Prosite, and IPA software, and the expression of several of the genes including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), tenascin, and ?-spectrin was assessed by immunofluorescence.Schlemm's canal cells differentially expressed ICAM-1, spectrin, complement, fibulin-1, and several genes consistent with an endothelial origin in both arrays, while the JCTM cells more often overexpressed genes consistent with contractile, matrix function, and neural character. At the same time, many genes highly expressed in the first array were not highly overexpressed in the second. One highly overexpressed gene in the JCTM in both arrays, that for heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 precursor, is thought to be somewhat unique, and could affect the glycosaminoglycan functionality in the extracellular matrix (ECM).We found generally good agreement between the 2 array trials, but some contradictions as well. Many of the genes overexpressed in each cell type had been described in earlier work, but several were new. Tables of genes, grouped by cellular function, and the complete datasets are provided for the development of new hypotheses.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Eye
