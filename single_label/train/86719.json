{"id":86719,"title":"Diaphragmatic neuromechanical coupling and mechanisms of hypercapnia during inspiratory loading.","abstract":"We hypothesized that improved diaphragmatic neuromechanical coupling during inspiratory loading is not sufficient to prevent alveolar hypoventilation and task failure, and that the latter results primarily from central-output inhibition of the diaphragm and air hunger rather than contractile fatigue. Eighteen subjects underwent progressive inspiratory loading. By task failure all developed hypercapnia. Tidal transdiaphragmatic pressure (?Pdi) and diaphragmatic electrical activity (?EAdi) increased during loading - the former more than the latter; thus, neuromechanical coupling (?Pdi/?EAdi) increased during loading. Progressive increase in extra-diaphragmatic muscle contribution to tidal breathing, expiratory muscle recruitment, and decreased end-expiratory lung volume contributed to improved neuromechanical coupling. At task failure, subjects experienced intolerable breathing discomfort, at which point mean ?EAdi was 74.9Â±4.9% of maximum, indicating that the primary mechanism of hypercapnia was submaximal diaphragmatic recruitment. Contractile fatigue was an inconsistent finding. In conclusion, hypercapnia during acute loading primarily resulted from central-output inhibition of the diaphragm suggesting that acute loading responses are controlled by the cortex rather than bulbopontine centers.
