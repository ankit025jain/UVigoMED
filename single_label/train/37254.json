{"id":37254,"title":"Systematic review of surgical treatment techniques for adult and pediatric patients with pectus excavatum.","abstract":"This compares outcome measures of current pectus excavatum (PEx) treatments, namely the Nuss and Ravitch procedures, in pediatric and adult patients. Original investigations that stratified PEx patients based on current treatment and age (pediatric=0-21; adult 17-99) were considered for inclusion. Outcome measures were: operation duration, analgesia duration, blood loss, length of stay (LOS), outcome ratings, complications, and percentage requiring reoperations. Adult implant patients (18.8%) had higher reoperation rates than adult Nuss or Ravitch patients (5.3% and 3.3% respectively). Adult Nuss patients had longer LOS (7.3 days), more strut/bar displacement (6.1%), and more epidural analgesia (3 days) than adult Ravitch patients (2.9 days, 0%, 0 days). Excluding pectus bar and strut displacements, pediatric and adult Nuss patients tended to have higher complication rates (pediatric - 38%; adult - 21%) compared to pediatric and adult Ravitch patients (12.5%; 8%). Pediatric Ravitch patients clearly had more strut displacements than adult Ravitch patients (0% and 6.4% respectively). These results suggest significantly better results in common PEx surgical repair techniques (i.e. Nuss and Ravitch) than uncommon techniques (i.e. Implants and Robicsek). The results suggest slightly better outcomes in pediatric Nuss procedure patients as compared with all other groups. We recommend that symptomatic pediatric patients with uncomplicated PEx receive the Nuss procedure. We suggest that adult patients receive the Nuss or Ravitch procedure, even though the long-term complication rates of the adult Nuss procedure require more investigation.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506826","annotations":[{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.781434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.672562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Nuss procedure","weight":0.645103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuss_procedure"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.521643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Pectus excavatum","weight":0.140579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectus_excavatum"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"1799","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1799"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Nielsen ratings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings"},{"name":"Bar (establishment)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(establishment)"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Strut","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strut"}]}
