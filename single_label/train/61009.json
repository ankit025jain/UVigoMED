{"id":61009,"title":"[Delayed HIV disease diagnosis, despite multiple hospitalizations--case report].","abstract":"Prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains very low in Poland and is estimated to be 0.2%. The number of people undergoing HIV-testing is low. Only 10% population was ever tested and the HIV morbidity increases yearly in Poland. The percentage of late diagnoses is high and remains so in recent years. The aim of the current paper was to present a case of female patient, the partner intravenous drug user, who was hospitalized several times due to: aseptic meningitis, delivery, thrombocytopenia and was never offered a HIV testing. The disease was diagnosed at the late stage with CD4 count of 39 cells/microl (13%). Diagnosis of the disease at the advanced stage potentially reduces a chance for successful treatment and is associated with worse prognosis. Routine testing for HIV infection should be widely available in any health care facility and be directed in particular to people with specific indicator conditions or risky behaviors.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779220","annotations":[{"name":"Aseptic meningitis","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aseptic_meningitis"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.838542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.776875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.660996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.49719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.23988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.233498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Actor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"}]}
