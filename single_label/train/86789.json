{"id":86789,"title":"[Safety and effectiveness of pemetrexed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in Japan - analysis of post-marketing surveillance].","abstract":"The safety and effectiveness of pemetrexed(PEM)in patients with non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC)were reviewed using data from post-marketing surveillance. Among 699 patients registered from June 2009 to May 2010, 683 patients were analyzed(343, first-line therapy: 340, second-line therapy or beyond). Patient backgrounds were as follows: median age=65 years(16.1%B75 years old); 64.7% male; 91.9% performance status 0-1; 83.2% Stage IV; 99.0% non-squamous cell cancer. Also, 86% of the first-line and 20% of the second-line cohort were receiving a concomitant anti-cancer drug(mostly platinum agents). The incidence rate of adverse drug reactions(ADR)was 76.7%, including serious cases(18.0%). The most common ADRs were decreased white blood cell count(26.8%), decreased neutrophil count(25.3%), anemia(19.2%), decreased platelet count(17.0%), and nausea(23.0%). The incidence of interstitial lung disease, which is a concern during chemotherapy, was 2.6%. Peripheral neuropathy and alopecia, events influencing a patient's quality of life, were less than 1%. The estimated median survival time was 23.2 months[95%CI: 19.8 months-not calculable]in the first-line cohort, and 11.8 months[95% CI: 10.5-13.7 months]in the B second-line cohort. The surveillance results showed no apparent difference in total ADRs in this current study compared to the safety profile established in clinical trials previously conducted in Japan and overseas. These results demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of PEM treatment for NSCLC patients in daily clinical settings.
