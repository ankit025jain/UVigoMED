{"id":67322,"title":"Association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism from chromosome 17q12 with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer in a Hispanic population.","abstract":"To study the association between the polymorphisms, rs1859962 and rs4430796, from the chromosomes 17q24 and 17q12, respectively, with the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) and its clinical characteristics in a Hispanic (Chilean) population.This study included 33 controls and 167 patients diagnosed with PCa. The polymorphisms, rs1859962 and rs4430796, were analyzed on blood specimens using quantitative PCR. The genetic analysis of the qPCR data was performed using the SNPStats program. A comparison between the clinical characteristics of the prostate cancers from the patients and the presence of the different polymorphism genotypes detected in blood specimens obtained from these patients was performed using the IBM SPSS v20.0 software.We observed no association of the SNPs and the risk of developing PCa (OR 0.84, 95 % CI 0.30-2.38, p = 1.0 to rs1859962 and OR 1.94, 95 % CI 0.57-6.52, p = 0.28 to rs4430796), both sporadic and hereditary. However, patients carrying the genotype G/G from the polymorphism rs4430796 had significantly higher PSA levels than patients carrying the other genotypes (15.05 ng/ml to G/G, 10 and 8.11 ng/ml to genotypes A/G y A/A, respectively, p = 0.01). Furthermore, patients with the genotype G/G of rs4430796 had higher tumor volume than other genotypes (9.45 cc to G/G and 5.22 cc to A/G + A/A, p = 0.04).The polymorphism rs4430796 of the chromosome 17q12 appears to be a biomarker for cancer aggressiveness, increased PSA and tumor volume of PCa.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627192","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.817003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.769534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Chromosome 17 (human)","weight":0.636901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_17_(human)"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.45839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Genetic analysis","weight":0.408804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_analysis"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.337353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"IBM","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Cubic centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_centimetre"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
