{"id":30913,"title":"[The use of remaxol in combined intensive therapy of acute mushroom poisoning].","abstract":"A case of very severe mushroom poisoning is reported. Traditional hepatoprotective therapy with ademethionine, ornithine-aspartate, and essential phospholipids failed to ensure positive dynamics of the hepatic and general functional state. Hepatic insufficiency was complicated by cerebral oedema and swelling, bilateral pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress of mixed genesis. Combined therapy with remaxol and ornithine aspartate produced beneficial effect, resulted in the improvement of the patient's condition and favorable outcome of the life-threatening intoxication.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437160","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebral edema","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.739281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.517554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.441668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.396238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.348146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.238296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Substance intoxication","weight":0.229307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication"},{"name":"Mushroom","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Ornithine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithine"},{"name":"Amanita phalloides","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_phalloides"},{"name":"Phospholipid","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipid"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"}]}
