{"id":56158,"title":"Comparison of morphologic features of macular proliferative vitreoretinopathy and idiopathic epimacular membrane.","abstract":"To compare the spectral-domain optical coherence tomography morphologic features and visual characteristics of a series of patients with epimacular membrane with and without a history of retinal breaks.Prospective, comparative case series of patients with epimacular membrane. All patients were evaluated with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and detailed peripheral retinal examination. Symptomatic patients were treated with pars plana vitrectomy and epimacular membrane removal based on standard visual criteria.Macular proliferative vitreoretinopathy was present in 21 of 50 patients (42%). Approximately 18 of 21 patients had a previous retinal break, 5 of which were untreated before the initial examination. No retinal breaks were observed in the idiopathic group. Macular proliferative vitreoretinopathy was highly associated with a history of retinal breaks (P < 0.001). Presenting visual acuity was significantly worse (mean, 0.86 ± 0.44) for macular proliferative vitreoretinopathy than for the idiopathic group (mean, 0.44 ± 0.36).Epimacular membrane occurring in the context of previous retinal breaks or macular proliferative vitreoretinopathy has a characteristic morphologic feature in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Surgical removal typically results in significant visual improvement.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736464","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.825349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.580126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.423377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.368238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.350815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.325594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.272868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.22791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.104275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0663472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.0627764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Pars plana","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pars_plana"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Plana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plana"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
