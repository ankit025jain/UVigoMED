{"id":72297,"title":"Impact of itraconazole on the survival of heavily pre-treated patients with triple-negative breast cancer.","abstract":"Recurrent triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have poor prognoses and limited treatment options, especially after progression during prior chemotherapy. The present study aimed to determine the impact of itraconazole with chemotherapy in these patients.Medical records of recurrent TNBC patients receiving itraconazole with chemotherapy between 2008 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed.Thirteen patients who progressed during prior chemotherapy (12 with visceral organ metastases) were enrolled. All patients had received docetaxel, carboplatin, and gemcitabine with itraconazole. Additionally, 3 patients with pleural effusion and 2 with inflammatory breast cancer received bevacizumab. No febrile neutropenia, platelet transfusion, or chemotherapy-related death was observed during treatment with itraconazole. The response rate, median progression-free survival, and median overall survival were 62% (95% confidence interval (CI): 35-88%), 10.8 months (95%CI: 7.6-15.3 months), and 20.4 months (95%CI: 13.1-41.4 months), respectively.Chemotherapy with itraconazole is promising for heavily pre-treated TNBC patients.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982411","annotations":[{"name":"Carboplatin","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboplatin"},{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Itraconazole","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itraconazole"},{"name":"Inflammatory breast cancer","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_breast_cancer"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Gemcitabine","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemcitabine"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.43322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Plateletpheresis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateletpheresis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0450952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"}]}
