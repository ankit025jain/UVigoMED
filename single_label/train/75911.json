{"id":75911,"title":"Beta-amyloid auto-antibodies are reduced in Alzheimer's disease.","abstract":"Accumulation and cytotoxicity of amyloid beta (A?) are understood as the major cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is evidence that naturally occurring antibodies against amyloid beta (A?) protein play a role in A?-clearance, and such a mechanism appears to be impaired in AD. In the present study, the anti-A? antibodies in the serum from individuals with and without late onset AD were measured using ELISA and dot-blot methods. A? auto-antibodies in serum were mainly targeted to A?1-15 epitope and its titer was significantly lower in AD patients than elderly non-AD controls (NC). The dot-blot analysis further demonstrated that auto-antibodies against fibrillar A?42, A?1-15 and A?16-30 epitopes were all in a lower level in AD than in NC. The isotypes of the auto-antibodies were mainly non-inflammatory IgG2 type. We also analyzed the relationship of auto-A? antibody levels with the genotypes of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and ANKK1/DRD2 gene.
