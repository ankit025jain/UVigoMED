{"id":4512,"title":"Automatic polyp detection using global geometric constraints and local intensity variation patterns.","abstract":"This paper presents a new method for detecting polyps in colonoscopy. Its novelty lies in integrating the global geometric constraints of polyps with the local patterns of intensity variation across polyp boundaries: the former drives the detector towards the objects with curvy boundaries, while the latter minimizes the misleading effects of polyp-like structures. This paper makes three original contributions: (1) a fast and discriminative patch descriptor for precisely characterizing patterns of intensity variation across boundaries, (2) a new 2-stage classification scheme for accurately excluding non-polyp edges from an overcomplete edge map, and (3) a novel voting scheme for robustly localizing polyps from the retained edges. Evaluations on a public database and our own videos demonstrate that our method is promising and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","date":"2014-12-08","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485377","annotations":[{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.106224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Polyp","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Completeness","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness"},{"name":"Voting","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Graph theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Novelty song","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_song"},{"name":"Automatic transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"},{"name":"Patch (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"},{"name":"Original research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_research"},{"name":"Index term","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_term"},{"name":"Constraint (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Discriminative model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminative_model"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Classification scheme","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_scheme"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
