{"id":72530,"title":"Combined treatment with paclitaxel and suramin prevents the development of metastasis by inhibiting metastatic colonization of circulating tumor cells.","abstract":"Metastatic disease accounts for most deaths due to breast cancer and thus identification of novel ways to prevent this complication remains a key goal. A frequently employed preclinical model of breast cancer metastasis relies on xenografted human MDA-MB-231 cells, since these reliably produce both soft tissue and osseous metastases when introduced into the arterial circulation of athymic mice. Herein, we explored the ability of suramin (SA), an agent shown to antagonize the effects of various stromal cell-derived growth factors relevant to bone marrow colonization of tumor cells, administered both with and without paclitaxel (PTX), to inhibit the development of MDA-MB-231 metastases. Treatment with SA, PTX, or PTX plus SA (PTX/SA) was begun either at day-1, or 7Â days after intra-arterial inoculation of luciferase-expressing MDA-MB-231-luc2 cells. Using in vivo and ex vivo bioluminescence imaging to detect macro-metastases, we found that PTX/SA treatment initiated on day-1 was able to dramatically reduce the frequency of bone metastases. PTX/SA and PTX administration commenced at day 7, in contrast, had no significant effect on the frequency of bone metastases, but exerted a relatively modest inhibitory effect on growth of metastases. Interestingly, reminiscent of what is seen clinically in anti-HER2 treated individuals, several of the PTX/SA-treated long term survivors went on to develop late onset CNS metastasis. Our results suggest that combining SA with PTX either in an adjuvant setting or during medical interventions that can increase the numbers of circulating tumour cells might be an effective way to prevent the development of metastases.
