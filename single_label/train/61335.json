{"id":61335,"title":"Astragaloside IV attenuates allergic inflammation by regulation Th1/Th2 cytokine and enhancement CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3 T cells in ovalbumin-induced asthma.","abstract":"Astragaloside IV is the chief ingredient of Radix Astragali, which has been used in the Traditional Chinese Medicine as a major component of many polyherbal formulations for the repair and regeneration of injured organ and tissues. We tested the anti-asthmatic effects of AST IV and the possible mechanisms. BALB/c mice that were sensitized and challenged to ovalbumin (OVA) were treated with AST IV (40mg/kg and 20mg/kg) 1h before they were challenged with OVA. Our study demonstrated that AST IV inhibited OVA-induced increases in eosinophil count; interleukin (IL)-4 level were recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid increased IFN-? and IL-10 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histological studies demonstrated that AST IV substantially inhibited OVA-induced eosinophilia in lung tissue. Flow cytometry studies demonstrated that AST IV substantially increased CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3 T cells (Treg). Furthermore quantitative real-time (qPCR) studies demonstrated that AST IV substantially enhanced Foxp3 mRNA expression in lung tissue. These findings suggest that AST IV may effectively ameliorate the progression of airway inflammation and could be used as a therapy for patients with allergic inflammation.
