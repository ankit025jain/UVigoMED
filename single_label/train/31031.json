{"id":31031,"title":"HIV, syphilis, and behavioral risk factors among female sex workers before and after implementation of harm reduction programs in a high drug-using area of China.","abstract":"To evaluate the impact of harm reduction programs on HIV and syphilis infection and related risk behaviors among female sex workers (FSWs) in a drug trafficking city in Southwest China.Before and after harm reduction program study.Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted among FSWs before and after harm reduction programs were launched in Xichang city, Sichuan province. The first and second cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2004 and 2010, respectively. Temporal changes in odds of HIV, syphilis, and behavioral risk factors were assessed by multivariable logistic regression while controlling for socio-demographics.The 2004 and 2010 cross-sectional surveys recruited 343 and 404 FSWs, respectively. From 2004 to 2010, the odds of syphilis infection decreased by 35% and was of borderline statistical significance (AOR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.41-1.03), while odds of HIV infection rose, but not significantly (AOR: 4.12, 95% CI: 0.76-22.45). Although odds of unprotected sex with primary sex partners did not significantly change over time (AOR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.61-1.50), odds of unprotected sex with clients declined significantly and remarkably (AOR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.09-0.21). Notably, the odds of reporting ?10 new sex partners in the previous month increased by 37% (AOR: 1.37; 95% CI: 0.98-1.90).Harm reduction strategies may be an effective means of reducing unprotected sex with clients among FSWs. Future research is needed to better target both FSWs and IDUs and interrupt bridging networks for HIV transmission in high drug-using areas of China.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24416319","annotations":[{"name":"Syphilis","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.748311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prostitution","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution"},{"name":"Harm reduction","weight":0.703668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_reduction"},{"name":"China","weight":0.656063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Sichuan","weight":0.631299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.531045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.522886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.437023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Safe sex","weight":0.435138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_sex"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.356173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sexual partner","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_partner"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Sex worker","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker"},{"name":"Human trafficking","weight":0.0527304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0401361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Southwest China","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_China"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Southwestern United States","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Social network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Recklessness (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recklessness_(psychology)"},{"name":"Xichang","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xichang"}]}
