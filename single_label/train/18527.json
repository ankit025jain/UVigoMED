{"id":18527,"title":"TNF-? modulates TLR2-dependent responses during mycobacterial infection.","abstract":"Multifunctional roles of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?) during the mycobacterial pathogenesis make it an important molecule to understand and to examine the course of infection. Identification and analysis of TNF-? response can largely contribute to determine the potential host mediators for therapeutic intervention against tuberculosis. The current chapter describes several methods to assess the ability of TNF-? signaling to modulate toll-like receptor (TLR)2 signaling, another key player in mycobacterial infection and its responses. Experiments involving neutralizing antibodies, antagonists, pharmacological inhibitors, and siRNA-mediated gene silencing are discussed in this chapter to establish the role of TNF-? signaling. The widely used protein and mRNA analysis readouts like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblotting, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and quantitative real-time RT-PCR are useful to estimate and confirm the mediators involved in TNF-? and TLR2 signaling.
