{"id":44101,"title":"Characterization of novel intergenogroup and intergenotype recombinant noroviruses from central Greece.","abstract":"Noroviruses (NoVs) are a major causative agent of acute gastroenteritis in humans. They are members of the Caliciviridae family and based on the genetic analysis of the RdRp and capsid regions, human NoVs are divided into three genogroups (Gs), GI, GII, and GIV. The three genogroups further segregate into distinct lineages called genotypes. The NoV genus is genetically diverse and recombination of viral RNA is known to depend upon various immunological and intracellular constraints that may allow the emergence of viable recombinants. In this study, three Noroviral strains detected in clinical samples revealed two hitherto unobserved recombination events between GII.9/GII.4 and GII.9/GI.7 genogroups. To our knowledge, these intergenotype and intergenogroup recombination events of GII.9/GII.4 and GII.9/GI.7, in ORF1 and ORF2 genes respectively are reported for the first time and highlight the ongoing evolution of noroviruses.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751495","annotations":[{"name":"Caliciviridae","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliciviridae"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Capsid","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsid"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Norovirus","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.755358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.727918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.580126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.574279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.548117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.483058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.438034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mendelian inheritance","weight":0.409501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance"},{"name":"Greece","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"},{"name":"Genetic analysis","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_analysis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sampling bias","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias"},{"name":"Lineage (evolution)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_(evolution)"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"ORF (broadcaster)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORF_(broadcaster)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"G-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force"},{"name":"Occam's razor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"}]}
