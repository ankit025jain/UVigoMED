{"id":45660,"title":"Symptom characteristics and psychosomatic profiles in different spectrum of gastroesophageal reflux disease.","abstract":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is diagnosed based on symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation but is a heterogeneous condition which can be subclassified according to endoscopy and esophageal reflux monitoring. The aim of this study was to identify differences in demographic characteristics and reflux symptom patterns among patients with various spectrum of GERD.Patients having weekly heartburn or acid regurgitation were classified into four pathophysiological subgroups according to endoscopy and pH monitoring: reflux esophagitis (RE), endoscopy-negative reflux disease with pathological reflux (PR+), hypersensitive esophagus (HE), and normal acid exposure with negative symptom association (pH-).A total of 195 patients were enrolled. The numbers of patients in the subgroups were: RE, 39.0%; PR+, 20.0%; HE, 10.3%; and pH-, 30.8%. Grossly, reflux symptom patterns and relieving/exacerbating factors did not differ between subgroups. Prevalence of extraesophageal syndrome was higher in patients with PR+ than in other groups. Overlapping functional dyspepsia was common in all groups. The SCL-90-R depression score was higher in PR+ patients than in RE patients (p<0.05).Demographic characteristics and reflux symptom patterns cannot differentiate pH- group from GERD subtypes. Esophageal pH monitoring could be considered for the initial evaluation of GERD in the tertiary referral setting.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672658","annotations":[{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Dyspepsia","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspepsia"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.837652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Psychosomatic medicine","weight":0.829491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic_medicine"},{"name":"Esophagitis","weight":0.821863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagitis"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.80345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heartburn","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartburn"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.689504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.214119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Esophageal pH monitoring","weight":0.137976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_pH_monitoring"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"}]}
