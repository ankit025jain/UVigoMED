{"id":60389,"title":"[Immune thrombocytopenias: pathophysiology and treatment].","abstract":"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is characterized by platelet destruction due to the presence of platelet antibodies. This phenomenon is associated with impaired platelet production by bone marrow. Short-course corticosteroids and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins remain the first-line treatments. Several international guidelines propose splenectomy as a second-line treatment for chronic ITP. However, new therapeutic strategies including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and thrombopoietin receptor agonists, appear to be very effective and to have good short-term tolerability. Prospective studies that include safety, efficacy and medico-economic assessments are needed to refine the management of chronic ITP.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919370","annotations":[{"name":"Thrombopoietin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombopoietin"},{"name":"Splenectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenectomy"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.710663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.652616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.507473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Thrombopoiesis","weight":0.208715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombopoiesis"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"}]}
