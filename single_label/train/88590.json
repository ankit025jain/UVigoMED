{"id":88590,"title":"A prospective randomized study of use of drain versus no drain after burr-hole evacuation of chronic subdural hematoma.","abstract":"Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) recurs after surgical evacuation in 5-30% of patients. Inserting subdural drain might reduce the recurrence rate, but is not commonly practiced. There are few prospective studies to evaluate the effect of subdural drains.A prospective randomized study to investigate the effect of subdural drains in the on recurrence rates and clinical outcome following burr-hole drainage (BHD) of CSDH was undertaken. During the study period, 246 patients with CSDH were assessed for eligibility. Among 200 patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria, 100 each were assigned to \"drain group\" (drain inserted into the subdural space following BHD) and \"without drain group\" (subdural drain was not inserted following BHD) using random allocation software. The primary end point was recurrence needing re-drainage up to a period of 6 months from surgery.Recurrence occurred in 9 of 100 patients with a drain, and 26 of 100 patients in without drain group (P = 0.002). The mortality was 5% in patients with drain and 4% in patients without drain group (P = 0.744). The medical and surgical complications were comparable between the two study groups.Use of a subdural drain after burr-hole evacuation of a CSDH reduces the recurrence rate and is not associated with increased complications.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24823727","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.785026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.537146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.367061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Subdural hematoma","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdural_hematoma"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Subdural space","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdural_space"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Random sample","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"744","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/744"},{"name":"246","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/246"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Bahraini dinar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahraini_dinar"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Area code 530","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_530"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"}]}
