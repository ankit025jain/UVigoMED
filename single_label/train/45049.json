{"id":45049,"title":"Environmental transmission of human noroviruses in shellfish waters.","abstract":"Human noroviruses (NoV) are the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis following consumption of bivalve shellfish contaminated with fecal matter. NoV levels can be effectively reduced by some sewage treatment processes such as activated sludge and membrane bioreactors. However, tertiary sewage treatment and substantial sewage dilution are usually required to achieve low concentrations of virus in shellfish. Most outbreaks have been associated with shellfish harvested from waters affected by untreated sewage from, for example, storm overflows or overboard disposal of feces from boats. In coastal waters, NoV can remain in suspension or associate with organic and inorganic matter and be accumulated by shellfish. Shellfish take considerably longer to purge NoV than fecal indicator bacteria when transferred from sewage-polluted estuarine waters to uncontaminated waters. The abundance and distribution of NoV in shellfish waters are influenced by the levels of sewage treatment, proximity of shellfish beds to sewage sources, rainfall, river flows, salinity, and water temperature. Detailed site-specific information on these factors is required to design measures to control the viral risk.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705321","annotations":[{"name":"Bivalvia","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivalvia"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Shellfish","weight":0.816307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellfish"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Estuary","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.78965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Salinity","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity"},{"name":"Norovirus","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus"},{"name":"Inorganic compound","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inorganic_compound"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Sewage","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.666711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Rain","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain"},{"name":"Sludge","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sludge"},{"name":"River","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.590954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.543279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Coast","weight":0.394432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.368114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.347706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Storm","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.295177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Activated sludge","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_sludge"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.244756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Boat","weight":0.196893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat"},{"name":"Bioreactor","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioreactor"},{"name":"Membrane bioreactor","weight":0.0570943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_bioreactor"},{"name":"Territorial waters","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_waters"},{"name":"Indicator bacteria","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_bacteria"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Menstruation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Logging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"}]}
