{"id":21553,"title":"Usefulness of 18F-FDG-PET/CT in aortic graft infection: two cases.","abstract":"Diagnosis of vascular graft prosthesis infection is crucial, but not straightforward. Here we report two cases in which [(18)F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) was very useful in the diagnosis of aortic graft infection. Case 1: A 77-year-old Japanese man, two months status post aortic arch graft surgery, suffered from repeated fevers. Blood cultures revealed bacteremia. (18)F-FDG-PET/CT ruled out graft infection and diagnosed lumbar pyogenic spondylitis, which was treated with antibiotics, sparing the patient a possible reoperation. Case 2: A 53-year-old Japanese man, seven years status post replacement of the aortic root and ascending aorta, had been suffering from an ostensibly aseptic fistula for over a year and a half. Although repeated CT findings had been negative, (18)F-FDG-PET/CT clearly demonstrated communication between the fistula and the ascending aortic graft. He was treated with repeat ascending aortic replacement, omentopexy, and antibiotics. Our experience supports (18)F-FDG-PET/CT as a promising modality in cases of suspected vascular graft infection.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597795","annotations":[{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.825813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.689479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.649945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.646244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.610763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Ascending aorta","weight":0.576261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_aorta"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.416595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Pyogenic","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyogenic"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.119851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Fluorine","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Aortic arch","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_arch"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Spondylitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylitis"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"}]}
