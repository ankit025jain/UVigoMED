{"id":64203,"title":"Assessment of wrist joint inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis by quantitative two- and three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasonography.","abstract":"We aimed to compare the use of computer-aided quantification methods with 3 different power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS) modes to assess wrist inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).This study enrolled 49 patients (60 hand joints) with RA. Clinical parameters (rheumatoid factor [RF], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were measured and pain was evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS, range: 0 to 10). Imaging of the affected wrist joints was performed with 2D- and 3D-PDUS imaging. The 2D imaging used a volumetric transducer and a linear transducer and the 3D imaging employed a volumetric transducer. Software was used to calculate the vascularisation index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularisation flow index (VFI) under different measurement conditions.There were 8 males and 41 females, with an average age of 47.59±15.17 years, and average VAS score of 3.63±2.22. In 2D-PDUS with a linear probe, there were significant correlations of ESR with VI and VFI, and of CRP with area, VI, and VFI (p<0.05 for all comparisons). In 3D-PDUS, there was a significant correlation of CRP with VFI (p<0.05). In all 3 measurement modes, there were moderate or high levels of inter- and intra-operator agreement in measurement of area/volume, VI, FI, and VFI.All 3 PDUS measurement modes had high accuracy and reliability in assessment of wrist inflammation. These results suggest that use of a 3D transducer, which is more expensive and time-consuming, is not necessary for assessment of wrist inflammation.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25198103","annotations":[{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.897172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Rheumatoid factor","weight":0.889499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_factor"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.780994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.710347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.695711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Transducer","weight":0.550458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.518327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.443318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.379832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.359797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.229564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Reliability engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Stereoscopy","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"}]}
