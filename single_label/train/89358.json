{"id":89358,"title":"The diagnostic and grading value of diffusion tensor imaging in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.","abstract":"In this study, we investigated the diagnostic and grading value of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).Of the 120 subjects included in the present study, 72 were in the CTS group and 48 were in the healthy control group. In addition, the patients with CTS were further divided into three subgroups based on severity (mild, moderate, and severe) according to electrophysiological studies (EPS). DTI-derived parameters (fractional anisotropy [FA] and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) were evaluated at four median nerve levels. The mean FA and ADC values of the CTS groups and healthy controls were compared separately. Correlations and possible relationships between DTI parameters and EPS results were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was used to calculate the FA and ADC cutoff values for CTS diagnosis and grading.Statistically significant differences were observed in mean FA and ADC between the normal and mild, mild and moderate, and moderate and severe subgroups. Significant correlations were found between DTI parameters and EPS measurements based on severity. FA and ADC threshold values, as well as the sensitivity and specificity levels, for diagnosing and grading CTS were determined.DTI parameters can provide helpful information for CTS. The correlations of FA and ADC measurements versus EPS measurements based on severity were significant. Moreover, FA and ADC threshold values were sufficient for the diagnosis and grading of CTS.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726891","annotations":[{"name":"Diffusion tensor imaging","weight":0.893457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_tensor_imaging"},{"name":"Diffusion MRI","weight":0.743067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_MRI"},{"name":"Carpal tunnel syndrome","weight":0.742865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.732324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.679772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.579182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Median nerve","weight":0.529774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_nerve"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.400359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Anisotropy","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.150134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Brownian motion","weight":0.116055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tensor","weight":0.10298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Fractional anisotropy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_anisotropy"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"The Football Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Cardiac electrophysiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_electrophysiology"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Polystyrene","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene"},{"name":"Analog-to-digital converter","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Carpal tunnel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel"}]}
