{"id":51989,"title":"MicroRNA-518d regulates PPAR? protein expression in the placentas of females with gestational diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"The placenta is thought to have a critical role in the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), as GDM?associated complications resolve following delivery. Placenta-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) may contribute to the pathology of the development of GDM. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the placenta-specific miR-518d contributes to the development of GDM. It was revealed that miR-518d expression was higher in placentas taken from patients with GDM compared with control placentas, whereas the protein levels of the predicted miR-518d target gene, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR?), were lower in placentas from patients with GDM compared with those from control subjects. It was also demonstrated that PPAR? was a direct target of miR-518d with a specific binding site at the seed sequence, which determines target specificity. In the placentas of females with GDM increased levels of miR-518d were negatively correlated with the levels of PPAR? protein. As PPAR? dysregulation may be related to the development of GDM, it is suggested that upregulation of miR-518d may be associated with the pathogenesis of GDM via an effect on the regulation of PPAR? expression.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24639097","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Peroxisome","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Placenta","weight":0.788588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.729353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.677797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor"},{"name":"Gestational diabetes","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.381316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.280424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.252321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.159122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Emotional dysregulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"GNOME Display Manager","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Display_Manager"}]}
