{"id":82731,"title":"Association between COX-2 rs 6681231 genotype and interleukin-6 in periodontal connective tissue. A pilot study.","abstract":"The aim of this pilot study was to investigate associations between IL-6 and COX-2 expression in gingival biopsies and both clinical diagnosis and genotypes in the IL-6 and COX-2 genes.A case-control study included 41 gingival biopsies obtained from Caucasian patients grouped according to clinical diagnosis of gingival health (n = 10), gingivitis (n = 15) or chronic periodontitis (n = 16). Immunohistochemistry analyses were performed to determine COX-2 expression in lamina propria, IL-6 expression in lamina propria and gingival epithelium and level of inflammatory cell infiltrate. Individual DNA was extracted and genotyped by real-time PCR for IL6 SNPs rs 2069827 and rs 2069825 and for COX-2 rs 6681231.The percentage of cellular COX-2 expression was associated with the extent of periodontal disease (Arbes index p = 0.026) and inflammatory infiltrate (p<0.0001). No association was observed between IL6 haplotypes and cells positive to IL-6 or COX-2 in gingival tissues. The COX-2 rs 6681231 was associated with cells positive to IL-6 in the connective tissue (p = 0.032).COX-2 expression in gingival tissues may be a marker of periodontal disease severity. COX-2 rs 6681231 may be associated with IL-6 local production in gingival tissues.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551049","annotations":[{"name":"Lamina propria","weight":0.890718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamina_propria"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.835574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.735518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.573842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.418918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.349003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.256906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.139429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Index finger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
