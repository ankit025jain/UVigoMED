{"id":90086,"title":"Ultrasound to assess bone quality.","abstract":"Bone quality is determined by a variety of compositional, micro- and ultrastructural properties of the mineralized tissue matrix. In contrast to X-ray-based methods, the interaction of acoustic waves with bone tissue carries information about elastic and structural properties of the tissue. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) methods represent powerful alternatives to ionizing x-ray based assessment of fracture risk. New in vivo applicable methods permit measurements of fracture-relevant properties, [eg, cortical thickness and stiffness at fragile anatomic regions (eg, the distal radius and the proximal femur)]. Experimentally, resonance ultrasound spectroscopy and acoustic microscopy can be used to assess the mesoscale stiffness tensor and elastic maps of the tissue matrix at microscale resolution, respectively. QUS methods, thus, currently represent the most promising approach for noninvasive assessment of components of fragility beyond bone mass and bone microstructure providing prospects for improved assessment of fracture risk.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652476","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Micrometre","weight":0.718494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.673329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.554905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Tensor","weight":0.513199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.471782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.446074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.437634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.394509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Microstructure","weight":0.353834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstructure"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.348154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.292974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.224581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.145234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Osseous tissue","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseous_tissue"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Mineralized tissues","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralized_tissues"},{"name":"Biomineralization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomineralization"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Optical resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_resolution"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Microscopic scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_scale"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
