{"id":55083,"title":"Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of melt-associated retroprosthetic membranes in the Boston type 1 keratoprosthesis.","abstract":"Retroprosthetic membrane (RPM) formation is the most common complication associated with the Boston type 1 keratoprosthesis and has been associated with corneal melt.To identify the histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of RPMs associated with corneal melt.Observational histopathological case series at a tertiary eye care referral center among patients who underwent Boston type 1 keratoprosthesis explantation because of donor corneal melt at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary between January 1, 2011, and January 1, 2012.Seven RPM specimens from 7 eyes were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin AE1/3, smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and CD34. Light microscopy was used to evaluate specimens for inflammation and epithelial ingrowth. XY-karyotyping using fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on 4 specimens with known donor-recipient sex mismatch.Histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of RPMs.Inflammatory cells were present in 4 of 7 RPMs. In 3 of 4 sex-mismatched specimens, tissue XY-karyotyping of the RPM interphase cells was consistent with the host sex karyotype. The fourth specimen showed a mixture of recipient-type and donor-type cells.Melt-associated RPMs show variable degrees of inflammation. Most membranes seem to originate from a proliferation of host cells, but donor tissue may contribute in some cases.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25010136","annotations":[{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.92209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Vimentin","weight":0.910769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimentin"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.854349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cytokeratin","weight":0.748454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokeratin"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Light microscopy","weight":0.726801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_microscopy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Interphase","weight":0.709788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interphase"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.701212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.693367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.652961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.639073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.478862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.154458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.0630793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Optometry","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometry"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0218433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Eye","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Boston","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
