{"id":77198,"title":"Clinical considerations and mechanistic determinants of postprandial lipemia in older adults.","abstract":"The typical diet of individuals in Western societies results in metabolic responses associated with fed-state fat metabolism for most of the daily life of the individual. This fat metabolism is characterized specifically by an increase in the concentration of plasma lipids, primarily triglycerides. Increased postprandial lipemia, which is typically observed in older individuals (i.e., >65 y old), has now emerged as an important correlate of cardiovascular disease risk. An understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the increased postprandial lipemia in older individuals becomes, therefore, of particular clinical importance in any effort to explain and address the well-documented increase in cardiovascular disease risk as individuals age. Current evidence points to an increase in the accumulation of ingested lipid in lipoprotein particles of hepatic origin, together with an overall accumulation of lipid in these lipoproteins during the postprandial period, as primary contributors to the postprandial lipemia in older persons. When this evidence is considered together with the evidence suggesting large atherogenic potential of lipoproteins of hepatic origin, this can, at least in part, explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in older individuals. Understanding changes in the metabolism of ingested fat in the immediate postprandial period with advancing age, and how lifestyle interventions such as diet and physical exercise can ameliorate the increase in postprandial lipemia in older individuals, is important in order to address the increased cardiovascular disease risk in this particularly affected and growing segment of the population.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24829469","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.832852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.775158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.773426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.636935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Fatty acid metabolism","weight":0.437196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_metabolism"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.344691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.33895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.288693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"}]}
