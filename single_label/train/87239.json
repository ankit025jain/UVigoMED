{"id":87239,"title":"[Small tension pneumothoraxes according to roentgenogram].","abstract":"The article analyzes the results of clinical observations and significance of small pneumothorax which displaces the mediastinum in polytrauma. On the basis of clinical data the author compiled a comparison table of tension and non-tension pneumothoraxes. For the first time it was stated the significance of small tension pneumothorax and validated the reason to consider small pneumothoraxes which shift the mediastinum as \"tension\" according to roentgenogram.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552108","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Polytrauma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytrauma"},{"name":"Compiler","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler"},{"name":"Engine displacement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_displacement"},{"name":"Table (information)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Verification and validation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation"}]}
