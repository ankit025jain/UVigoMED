{"id":90043,"title":"Fractographic analysis of 2.0-mm plates with a screw locking system in simulated fractures of the mandibular body.","abstract":"The purpose of the present study was to analyze the fractured plates from 2 brands of 2.0-mm locking fixation systems submitted to axial linear load testing.Four aluminum hemimandibles with linear sectioning to simulate a mandibular body fracture were used as a substrate and fixed with 2 fixation techniques from 2 national brands: TÃ³ride and Traumec. The techniques were as follows: one 4-hole plate, with four 6-mm screws in the tension zone, and one 4-hole plate, with four 10-mm screws in the compression zone; and one 4-hole plate, with four 6-mm holes in the neutral zone. The hemimandibles were submitted to vertical linear load tests using an Instron 4411 mechanical test machine. The system was submitted to the test until complete failure had occurred. Next, a topographic analysis of the surface of the plates was performed using a stereomicroscope and an electronic scanning microscope. The samples were evaluated using different magnifications, and images were obtained.The surface of the fracture analyzed in scanning electron microscopy demonstrated a ductile-type fracture, usually found in the traction test bodies of ductile materials, such as titanium. No evidence of failure was observed in any fracture surface from a change in the structure or composition of the material.The plates were fractured by a ductile rupture mechanism, as expected, suggesting that the manufacturing of the national brand name plates used in the present study has been under adequate quality control, with no structural changes produced by the manufacturing process that could compromise their function.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Wounds and
