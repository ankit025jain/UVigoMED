{"id":61834,"title":"Ocular sarcoidosis: does (18)F-FDG PET/CT have any role?","abstract":"Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic disease, which may affect almost any organ including the eyes. Recently, F-FDG PET/CT has proved to be a very useful molecular imaging method allowing to obtain a complete morphofunctional cartography of active inflammatory sites and to assess treatment response in patients with sarcoidosis. We report 2 cases of sarcoidosis where F-FDG PET/CT showed intense FDG uptake in the eye globes along with multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes suggestive of active sarcoidosis with ocular involvement.
