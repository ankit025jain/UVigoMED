{"id":36254,"title":"One-stage surgical correction in pentalogy of Cantrell with left ventricular diverticulum.","abstract":"The pentalogy of Cantrell is a rare and fatal malformation. A left ventricular diverticulum is a common finding of this pentalogy. The present report summarizes our experience with three patients who suffered from pentalogy of Cantrell. All three cases had a left ventricular diverticulum. The intracardiac malformations and the left ventricular diverticulum were corrected simultaneously. All patients recovered uneventfully. One-stage surgical correction could improve short-term outcomes in selected patients with pentalogy of Cantrell.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24588715","annotations":[{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.337565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pentalogy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentalogy"},{"name":"Diverticulum","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulum"},{"name":"Intracardiac injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracardiac_injection"}]}
