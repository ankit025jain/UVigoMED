{"id":47797,"title":"Increased gap density predicts weakness of the epithelial barrier in vivo by confocal laser endomicroscopy in indomethacin-induced enteropathy.","abstract":"The intestinal epithelial barrier plays an important role in the pathogenesis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy, and its disruption is often associated with increased cell shedding. The purpose of this report is to observe the gap density in indomethacin-induced small intestinal damage by confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) and to investigate the mechanisms involved in this process and how mucosal protectants improve intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction. CLE is expected to provide a new way for evaluating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-induced enteropathy in humans and assessing drug efficacy.Using the new technique of CLE, we established a method to evaluate, in real time, intestinal damage after the administration of indomethacin in Wistar rats by investigating the gap density in the small intestine. The mucosal protectant teprenone and acid-suppressant rabeprazole were then given by gavage before and after the administration of indomethacin, and the mechanisms affecting the intestinal epithelial barrier were investigated.Using CLE, gaps could be clearly observed and easily distinguished from goblet cells. Gap density was increased after the administration of indomethacin. During this process, the expression of tumor necrosis factor-?, nuclear factor-?B, and caspase-3 was up-regulated and the expression of tight junctions was down-regulated, which led to the damage of the epithelial barrier. Teprenone and rabeprazole could intervene in this pathway and protect the integrity of the epithelial barrier.CLE can be objective, accurate, and real time in investigating gap density. Teprenone and rabeprazole can prevent indomethacin-induced intestinal lesions and protect the epithelial barrier by intervening in the tumor necrosis factor-? pathway. Gap density was expected to be an indicator of evaluating intestinal inflammation and drug efficacy.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573719","annotations":[{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.836207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.780863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.770731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Indometacin","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.663645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.661694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.650423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Goblet cell","weight":0.622587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblet_cell"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.598153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Tight junction","weight":0.57086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_junction"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.483329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Rabeprazole","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabeprazole"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Plant defense against herbivory","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_defense_against_herbivory"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0474663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Moulting","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulting"},{"name":"Gap junction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_junction"},{"name":"Intestinal epithelium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_epithelium"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Enteropathy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteropathy"}]}
