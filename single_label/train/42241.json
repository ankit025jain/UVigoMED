{"id":42241,"title":"Impact of anti-thymocyte globulin during immunosuppression induction in patients with hepatitis C after liver transplantation.","abstract":"Induction immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) provides potential benefits after liver transplantation (LT). However, its use in patients with LT and hepatitis C (HCV) is controversial.To evaluate the 1- and 2-year patient survival and HCV recurrence rate in patients receiving ATG during the induction phase of immunosuppression (IPI) after LT.A total of 49 patients undergoing their first LT for HCV were randomized to receive ATG during IPI. Patient survival and HCV recurrence were determined at 1 and 2 years. The frequency of acute cellular rejection (ACR), infections, and neoplasms was also evaluated.Twenty-six patients were randomized to receive ATG (Arm-1) and 23 to standard induction therapy (Arm-2). Those given ATG had lower HCV recurrence (26.9 vs 73.9 %, p = 0.001). The 1- and 2-year patient survival rates were similar for both arms (p = 0.33). Infections occurred in 46.1 % subjects in Arm-1 and 34.7 % in Arm-2 (p = 0.562). There was a greater proportion of fungal infections in Arm-1 (19.2 vs 0 %, p = 0.032).ATG during the IPI was associated with lower frequency of recurrence of HCV in patients undergoing LT. This, however, did not affect the 1- and 2-year survival and the frequency of ACR, infections, or neoplasms.","date":"2014-10-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24865255","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.691792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.639713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anti-thymocyte globulin","weight":0.448912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-thymocyte_globulin"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.305641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Lithuania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"American College of Rheumatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Rheumatology"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.0156613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Weapon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Area code 562","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_562"}]}
