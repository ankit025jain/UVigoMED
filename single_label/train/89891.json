{"id":89891,"title":"Chronic morbidities after traumatic brain injury: an update for the advanced practice nurse.","abstract":"Emerging data suggest that traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a disease process with considerable long-range morbidities requiring lifelong monitoring and treatment. Multiple chronic morbidities develop across the life span after TBI, including mental health disorders, headaches, seizures, and neuroendocrine imbalances as well as chronic diseases. Still, there has been limited focus on effective guides and strategies for helping persons with TBI meet their chronic health needs as they live with the consequences of TBI. The advanced practice nurse is well positioned to participate collaboratively in practices that promote health screening and chronic disease management after TBI to ameliorate distress and enhance quality of life as persons with TBI live with lifelong consequences.
