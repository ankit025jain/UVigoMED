{"id":89370,"title":"Foot and ankle tendoscopy: evidence-based recommendations.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of the current literature on tendoscopy of the foot and ankle and assign an evidence-based grade of recommendation for or against intervention.A comprehensive review of the literature was performed on May 26, 2013, using the PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases. Studies focusing on the use of foot and ankle tendoscopy were isolated, and these articles were then reviewed and assigned a Level of Evidence (I through V). The literature was then analyzed, and a grade of recommendation was assigned for tendoscopy of the tendons of the foot and ankle on which the procedure is generally performed.There is weak evidence (grade Cf) to support the use of tendoscopy on the Achilles, flexor hallucis longus, andÂ peroneal tendons. Insufficient evidence (grade I) exists to assign a grade of recommendation for tendoscopy of the tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior, flexor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus, and extensor digitorum longus.A comprehensive review of the literature on foot and ankle tendoscopy has shown predominantly Level IV and V studies, with just 1 Level II study. On the basis of the current literature available, there is poor evidence (grade Cf) in support of Achilles, flexor hallucis longus, and peroneal tendoscopy for the common indications. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation (grade I) for or against tendoscopy of the tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior, flexor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus, and extensor digitorum longus. Although current literature suggests that tendoscopy is a safe and effective procedure, original scientific articles of higher levels of evidence are needed before a stronger recommendation can be assigned.Level IV, systematic review of Level II, IV, and V studies.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725986","annotations":[{"name":"Foot","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.413186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.410378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Flexor digitorum longus muscle","weight":0.335671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexor_digitorum_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Tibialis posterior muscle","weight":0.268701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibialis_posterior_muscle"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Extensor hallucis longus muscle","weight":0.196208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_hallucis_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Flexor hallucis longus muscle","weight":0.196208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexor_hallucis_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Tibialis anterior muscle","weight":0.195456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibialis_anterior_muscle"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.18128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.147371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Extensor digitorum longus muscle","weight":0.0895851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_digitorum_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Extensor digitorum muscle","weight":0.082094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_digitorum_muscle"},{"name":"Achilles tendon","weight":0.0496211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Scopus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0276285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Trochlear nerve","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"May 26","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_26"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Legal burden of proof","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof"},{"name":"Extensor carpi radialis longus muscle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_carpi_radialis_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Scientific literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Level II (Blackstreet album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_II_(Blackstreet_album)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.0113497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"}]}
