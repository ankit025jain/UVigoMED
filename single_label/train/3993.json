{"id":3993,"title":"[Clinical analysis of low grade myofibroblastic sarcoma in head and neck].","abstract":"To explore the clinical characteristic, the CT, MRI features, diagnosis and treatment of low grade myofibroblastic sarcoma in head and neck.Six cases of low grade myofibroblastic sarcoma in head and neck were diagnosis and reviewed retrospectively. Routine preoperative CT and MRI examination were performed.All cases were operated one case with radiotherapy before operation was given with a total dose of 60 Gy. The patients were follow-up for 6 months to 5 year and no recurrence was found. No complications occurred in 6 cases.It has been confirmed in this research that LGMS is a low-grade malignangt tumor. It was difficult to make early diagnosis through frozen section. The final diagnosis depend on paraffin section and immunohistochemisty. Extended local excision with tumor-free margin is the treatment of choice.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322605","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.799994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.77322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Paraffin","weight":0.709788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.635109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Frozen section procedure","weight":0.460448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_section_procedure"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.313525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.22596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.214498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Cryogenics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Myofibroblast","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofibroblast"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Radiation hardening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening"}]}
