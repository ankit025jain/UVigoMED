{"id":84060,"title":"Anatomical study of minor alterations in neonate vocal folds.","abstract":"Minor structural alterations of the vocal fold cover are frequent causes of voice abnormalities. They may be difficult to diagnose, and are expressed in different manners. Cases of intracordal cysts, sulcus vocalis, mucosal bridge, and laryngeal micro-diaphragm form the group of minor structural alterations of the vocal fold cover investigated in the present study. The etiopathogenesis and epidemiology of these alterations are poorly known.To evaluate the existence and anatomical characterization of minor structural alterations in the vocal folds of newborns.56 larynxes excised from neonates of both genders were studied. They were examined fresh, or defrosted after conservation via freezing, under a microscope at magnifications of 25× and 40×. The vocal folds were inspected and palpated by two examiners, with the aim of finding minor structural alterations similar to those described classically, and other undetermined minor structural alterations. Larynges presenting abnormalities were submitted to histological examination.Six cases of abnormalities were found in different larynges: one (1.79%) compatible with a sulcus vocalis and five (8.93%) compatible with a laryngeal micro-diaphragm. No cases of cysts or mucosal bridges were found. The observed abnormalities had characteristics similar to those described in other age groups.Abnormalities similar to sulcus vocalis or micro-diaphragm may be present at birth.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25183181","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.722756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.713328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.707375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.680657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.454352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.368449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Freezing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Manner of articulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manner_of_articulation"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Sulcus (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulcus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Thyroarytenoid muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroarytenoid_muscle"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Glossary of Gaelic games terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Gaelic_games_terms"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Conservation biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Abnormalities","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormalities"}]}
