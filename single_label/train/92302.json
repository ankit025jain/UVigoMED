{"id":92302,"title":"Sex differences in patients with different stages of knee osteoarthritis.","abstract":"To quantify the differences in physical impairments and in performance-based measures and patient-reported outcomes in men and women seeking nonoperative management of symptomatic moderate knee osteoarthritis (OA) and those with symptomatic end-stage knee OA scheduled for total knee arthroplasty compared with healthy controls.Cross-sectional analysis of individuals referred to physical therapy, community participants, and subjects from a 2-year longitudinal study.University research department.Cross-sectional analysis of participants (N=289) consisting of a moderate OA group (n=83), a severe OA group (n=143), and a healthy control group (n=63).Not applicable.Quadriceps strength, timed Up and Go test, stair-climbing test, 6-minute walk test, Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADLS), and Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey.Women had worse scores than men for physical impairment and performance-based measures (P<.001). In the moderate OA group, women had significantly lower KOS-ADLS (P=.007) and PCS (P=.026) scores than men, with no differences seen between sexes in the other 2 groups for patient-reported measures.Differences between women and men with knee OA on physical impairments and performance-based measures are not echoed in the differences seen in patient-reported measures. These measures signal different domains of knee function in patients with knee OA and should be used as part of a comprehensive functional evaluation.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25152171","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.810683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.683184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.581725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.581101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.55473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.359541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.18253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Lesbian","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Quadriceps femoris muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriceps_femoris_muscle"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0175646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Go (game)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)"},{"name":"Component video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_video"},{"name":"Quantity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity"},{"name":"Up (2009 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Knee osteoarthritis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Outcome-based education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome-based_education"},{"name":"Operations research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Sexual dimorphism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Liberalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"},{"name":"Non-overlapping magisteria","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-overlapping_magisteria"}]}
