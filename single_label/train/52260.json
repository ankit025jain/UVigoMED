{"id":52260,"title":"Biocompatible APTES-PEG modified magnetite nanoparticles: effective carriers of antineoplastic agents to ovarian cancer.","abstract":"Magnetite nanoparticles are particularly attractive for drug delivery applications because of their size-dependent superparamagnetism, low toxicity, and biocompatibility with cells and tissues. Surface modification of iron oxide nanoparticles with biocompatible polymers is potentially beneficial to prepare biodegradable nanocomposite-based drug delivery agents for in vivo and in vitro applications. In the present study, the bare (10 nm) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-(3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) (PA) modified (17 nm) superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO NPs) were synthesized by coprecipitation method. The anticancer drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX), were separately encapsulated into the synthesized polymeric nanocomposites for localized targeting of human ovarian cancer in vitro. Surface morphology analysis by scanning electron microscopy showed a slight increase in particle size (27?±?0.7 and 30?±?0.45 nm) with drug loading capacities of 70 and 61.5 % and release capabilities of 90 and 93 % for the DOX- and PTX-AP-SPIO NPs, respectively (p?<?0.001). Ten milligrams/milliliter DOX- and PTX-loaded AP-SPIO NPs caused a significant amount of cytotoxicity and downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins, as compared with same amounts of free drugs (p?<?0.001). In vivo antiproliferative effect of present formulation on immunodeficient female Balb/c mice showed ovarian tumor shrinkage from 2,920 to 143 mm(3) after 40 days. The present formulation of APTES-PEG-SPIO-based nanocomposite system of targeted drug delivery proved to be effective enough in order to treat deadly solid tumor of ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo.
