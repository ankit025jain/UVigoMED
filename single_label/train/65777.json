{"id":65777,"title":"Glucarpidase for the management of elevated methotrexate levels in patients with impaired renal function.","abstract":"The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, dosage, administration, and current role in therapy of a recently approved agent for controlling methotrexate toxicity are reviewed.Glucarpidase is a bacterial enzyme useful in reversing toxicity induced by the widely used antineoplastic agent methotrexate. Glucarpidase gained U.S. marketing approval in 2012 for reducing serum methotrexate concentrations greater than 1 ?M/L in patients with delayed methotrexate clearance due to impaired renal function. In clinical trials, glucarpidase has been administered to a total of 3887 patients receiving high-dose methotrexate (i.e., doses of ?500 mg/m(2)), including pediatric patients. Patients treated with glucarpidase in addition to standard supportive care (hydration, urinary alkalization, leucovorin rescue, and, in some cases, hemodialysis) had a mean reduction in serum methotrexate levels of greater than 88%, with reductions occurring in a median of 15 minutes; however, up to 4.4% of adult patients and up to 6% of pediatric patients in clinical trial cohorts died despite glucarpidase use, suggesting the agent might not confer a survival advantage over supportive care alone. Glucarpidase is well tolerated; the most common adverse effects are flushing, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and headache, which are typically grade 1 or 2 in severity and resolve without intervention.Glucarpidase is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for reducing serum methotrexate concentrations greater than 1 ?M/L in patients with impaired renal function. While there are few adverse effects associated with treatment, there may be little or no impact on methotrexate-associated mortality.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780487","annotations":[{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Folinic acid","weight":0.797295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folinic_acid"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.754493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.733029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.637278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.620859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Flushing (physiology)","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing_(physiology)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.400618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Approved drug","weight":0.335884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approved_drug"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.302246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Rehydration","weight":0.291462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehydration"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Marketing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
