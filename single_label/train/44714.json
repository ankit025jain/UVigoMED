{"id":44714,"title":"Over-the-Scope Clip (OTSC) application as rescue therapy for postoperative enterocutaneous fistula closure.","abstract":"Postoperative enterocutaneous fistulas are challenging with limited treatment options. The majority of patients with persistent fistula drainage flow require re-surgery. Recently the Over-The-Scope Clip (OTSC 11/6t, Ovesco Endoscopy, TÃ¼bingen, Germany) has become popular in Germany among surgeons and gastroenterologists for closure of perforations and bleeding vessels of the GI tract.A 48-year-old female patient suffered from enterocutaneous fistula for four months located at the left upper corner within the enteric anastomosis of the jejunal loop leading to malnourishment. Prior attempts at fistula closure with fibrin glue application failed. An OTSC with sharp teeth (model 11/6t) was placed under continuous suction onto the fistula orifice with consecutive closure. The fistula remained closed even after a follow-up period of 12 months.The authors demonstrate the technical feasibility of fistula closure by OTSC placement even in unfavorable enterocutaneous fistula positions possibly resulting in less surgical re-interventions in the future.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720148","annotations":[{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.804684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.682719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.657534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.575047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.448353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.444884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.443799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.417041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.318501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.269962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Fibrin glue","weight":0.164423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin_glue"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.0896295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Suction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Rescue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 48","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_48"}]}
