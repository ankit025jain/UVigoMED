{"id":13092,"title":"Study on A?34 biology and detection in transgenic mice brains.","abstract":"The ?-amyloid precursor protein undergoes cleavages by ?- and ?-secretasses yielding amyloid-? peptides (A?) that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease. Subsequently, A? peptides are targets of additional truncations or endoproteolytic cleavages explaining the diversity of A?-related fragments recovered in cell media or pathologic human fluids. Here, we focused on A?1-34 (A?34) that has been detected both in vitro and in vivo and that derives from the hydrolysis of A? by ?-secretase. We have obtained and fully characterized by immunologic and biochemical approaches, a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the C-terminus of A?x-34. We present immunohistochemical evidence for the presence of A?x-34 in the brain of 3xTg mice and Alzheimer's disease-affected human brains. Finally, we demonstrate a neprilysin-mediated degradation process of A?34 and the ability of synthetic A?34 to protect HEK cells overexpressing either wild type or Swedish-mutated ?-amyloid precursor protein from apoptosis.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495834","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.89669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Genetically modified organism","weight":0.782618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.706736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.681948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Polyclonal antibodies","weight":0.671351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.635388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Human brain","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"},{"name":"Amyloid precursor protein","weight":0.533788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_precursor_protein"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.47494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Body fluid","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fluid"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.213977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Amyloid precursor protein secretase","weight":0.133996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_precursor_protein_secretase"},{"name":"Protein precursor","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_precursor"},{"name":"Cleavage (embryo)","weight":0.0405809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(embryo)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
