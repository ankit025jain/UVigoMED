{"id":53927,"title":"How to improve the efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus neurolysis in pain management in patients with pancreatic cancer: analysis in a single center.","abstract":"Visceral pain secondary to pancreatic cancer is often difficult to control and poses a challenge to the physician. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN) in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Forty-one patients with severe pain despite treatment with opioids underwent EUS-CPN with absolute alcohol. Patients scored their pain on a scale of 0 to 10 and were interviewed after the procedure. Of the 41 patients, 33, 37, and 25 patients reported improvement in their pain within 3 days, at 1 week, and at 3 months, respectively, following the procedure. Of all the patients, 19 patients reported substantial improvement and 4 patients showed complete disappearance of pain. Complication appeared in 2 patients with transient hypotension. In our study, EUS-CPN is a safe and effective form of treatment for intractable pain secondary to advanced pancreatic cancer.
