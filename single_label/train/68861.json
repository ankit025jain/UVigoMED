{"id":68861,"title":"Randomized Phase II trial of nintedanib, afatinib and sequential combination in castration-resistant prostate cancer.","abstract":"The aim of this article was to evaluate afatinib (BIBW 2992), an ErbB family blocker, and nintedanib (BIBF 1120), a triple angiokinase inhibitor, in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.Patients were randomized to receive nintedanib (250 mg twice daily), afatinib (40 mg once daily [q.d.]), or alternating sequential 7-day nintedanib (250 mg twice daily) and afatinib (70 mg q.d. [Combi70]), which was reduced to 40 mg q.d. (Combi40) due to adverse events. The primary end point was progression-free rate at 12 weeks.Of the 85 patients treated 46, 20, 16 and three received nintedanib, afatinib, Combi40 and Combi70, respectively. At 12 weeks, the progression-free rate was 26% (seven out of 27 patients) for nintedanib, and 0% for afatinib and Combi40 groups. Two patients had a ?50% decline in PSA (nintedanib and the Combi40 groups). The most common drug-related adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and lethargy.Nintedanib and/or afatinib demonstrated limited anti-tumor activity in unselected advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490608","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.819848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.747474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.74448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.725075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.720071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.669984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"ErbB","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ErbB"},{"name":"Afatinib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afatinib"},{"name":"1120","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1120"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Triple (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Combi","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combi"}]}
