{"id":15087,"title":"[Adhesion of corynebacterium diphtheriae: the role of surface structures and formation mechanism].","abstract":"The paper is devoted to the study of surface structures including pili (fimbriae) 67-72p surface protein, DIP 1281 surface protein, lipoarabinomannan CdiLAM and their role in the adhesion and colonization of the mucous membrane of the throat by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. A description is offered for the main stages in the adhesion process of diphtheria causative agent and the ability of its adhesins to stimulate the effect of innate and acquired immunity factors. The paper stresses prospectiveness of the development of vaccines forming immunoprotection of the organism against adhesive activity of C. diphtheriae and also preventing their colonization and reproduction. That would facilitate a solution for the problem of diphtheria carrier state, which cannot be solved using the existing means of preventive vaccination.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286540","annotations":[{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Diphtheria","weight":0.818038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria"},{"name":"Corynebacterium","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corynebacterium"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.695154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.612287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.482719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Throat","weight":0.399804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.310982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Corynebacterium diphtheriae","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corynebacterium_diphtheriae"},{"name":"Bacterial adhesin","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_adhesin"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Pilus","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilus"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.0625596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Fimbria (bacteriology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fimbria_(bacteriology)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
