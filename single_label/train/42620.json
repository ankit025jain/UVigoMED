{"id":42620,"title":"Liver fibrosis in HIV: which role does HIV itself, long-term drug toxicities and metabolic changes play?","abstract":"Liver disease is one of the main causes of non-AIDS death in HIV-infected individuals from Europe and North America and has been attributed mainly to coinfection with hepatotropic viruses. However, HIV-induced inflammation as well as long-term antiretroviral drug toxicity may also contribute to clinical relevant liver disease. Therefore, a better understanding of liver disease beyond viral hepatitis coinfection is urgently needed in HIV-infected individuals.Cross-sectional fibroscan studies in HIV-infected patient populations have reported unexpectedly high rates of advance fibrosis in HIV-infected patients even without underlying viral hepatitis or alcohol abuse suggesting that HIV itself may contribute independently to liver disease. Finally, HIV therapy itself either through direct hepatotoxicity or long-term metabolic changes, such as dyslipidemia and/or insulin resistance, may additionally cause liver damage in life long treatment.Therefore, aging of the liver in HIV may play a much more pivotal role in the future considering age-related effects, coinfection with hepatotropic viruses and the toxicity of long-term antiviral treatment. Thus, adequate monitoring of liver disease and development of management algorithms are clearly needed to optimize outcome and care of the aging liver in an HIV-infected individual.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24840057","annotations":[{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.860937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.75467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.624187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.434077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Median lethal dose","weight":0.408763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.371708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.325053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.275511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.256444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.133549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"}]}
