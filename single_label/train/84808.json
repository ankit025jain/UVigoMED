{"id":84808,"title":"A dental implant-based registration method for measuring mandibular kinematics using cone beam computed tomography-based fluoroscopy.","abstract":"This study aimed to develop and evaluate experimentally an implant-based registration method for measuring three-dimensional (3D) kinematics of the mandible and dental implants in the mandible based on dental cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), modified to include fluoroscopic function.The proposed implant-based registration method was based on the registration of CBCT data of implants/bones with single-plane fluoroscopy images. Seven registration conditions that included one to three implants were evaluated experimentally for their performance in a cadaveric porcine headmodel.The implant-based registration method was shown to have measurement errors (SD) of less than -0.2 (0.3) mm, 1.1 (2.2) mm, and 0.7 degrees (1.3 degrees) for the in-plane translation, out-of-plane translation, and all angular components, respectively, regardless of the number of implants used. The corresponding errors were reduced to less than -0.1 (0.1) mm, -0.3 (1.7) mm, and 0.5 degree (0.4 degree) when three implants were used.An implant-based registration method was developed to measure the 3D kinematics of the mandible/implants. With its high accuracy and reliability, the new method will be useful for measuring the 3D motion of the bones/implants for relevant applications.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25032759","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.820679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Kinematics","weight":0.510704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.26034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.129368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Cone (geometry)","weight":0.115901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry)"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0526921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.0389337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"CBCT (TV)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBCT_(TV)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Secure Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Beam (structure)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(structure)"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Reliability engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Spiral computed tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_computed_tomography"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Observational error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_error"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"}]}
