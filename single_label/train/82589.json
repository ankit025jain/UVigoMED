{"id":82589,"title":"Survival of glass fiber post retained endodontically treated teeth preliminary report.","abstract":"The use of fiber reinforced composite post in restoration of endodontically treated teeth have been found to prevent irreparable root fracture and the fact that the post is bonded to the root giving a monobloc restoration, also strengthens the tooth. This preliminary study aimed to evaluate the survival of endodontically treated teeth with compromised coronal tooth structure restored with glass-fiber posts after 6 months.Twenty endodontically treated teeth with less than 50% coronal tooth structure, were assessed and restored with glass fiber reinforced post cemented with dual cure composite and porcelain fused to metal crown. Patients were recalled and the teeth re-assessed at 3 and 6 months to evaluate their survival. The criteria for success included post and core in situ with no displacement or detachment of the post, no crown or prosthesis decementation, no post, core, or root fracture and absence of periradicular conditions requiring endodontic retreatment.Eighteen teeth were available for review at both 3rd and 6th months out of which none had post-core-crown fracture. One tooth (5%) had minimal crevice on probing the margin at 6 month's review, while another tooth had < or =1 mm mobility of the crown during the same review period.Within the limitation of the study, there was an excellent performance of the teeth restored with glass fiber post with respect to post -core- crown and root fracture at the end of the 6months recall visit.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579389","annotations":[{"name":"Porcelain","weight":0.753378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcelain"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.642495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.615926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Fiberglass","weight":0.516849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.480937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.321849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Fibre-reinforced plastic","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre-reinforced_plastic"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.1159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Endodontic therapy","weight":0.0994939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontic_therapy"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"Post and core","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_and_core"},{"name":"Endodontic retreatment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontic_retreatment"},{"name":"Endodontics","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontics"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Engine displacement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_displacement"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Rmdir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rmdir"},{"name":"Product recall","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_recall"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Fracture (geology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture_(geology)"},{"name":"Ceramic matrix composite","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_matrix_composite"},{"name":"Monobloc engine","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monobloc_engine"},{"name":"Minimalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Electron mobility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_mobility"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"}]}
