{"id":66425,"title":"Small distal muscles and balance predict survival in end-stage renal disease.","abstract":"Survival for patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been shown to correlate to the level of physical activity and exercise capacity. We examined whether composite measures of functional status at the start of RRT predict survival.In this retrospective study, the same physiotherapist, using a standardized battery of tests for functional status, tested 134 patients at the start of RRT.At the end of the observation period, 112 patients (84%) were still alive. Age (p < 0.0001), co-morbidity (p = 0.028), hand grip strength (right: p = 0.0065; left: p = 0.0039), standing heel rise (right: p = 0.011; left: p = 0.004) and functional reach (p = 0.015) were significant predictors of survival. After adjustment for sex, age and co-morbidity, hand grip strength left (p = 0.023) was a significant predictor of survival.Hand grip strength, standing heel rise and functional reach at the start of RRT seem to affect survival. A 50% reduction in hand grip strength left was associated with an almost 3-fold increase in mortality. Deterioration of function in small distal muscles and balance may be early signs of uraemic myopathy. A relatively simple and clinically feasible battery of tests can help detect patients at risk.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713811","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.689762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.672698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.653243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.648901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.599793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Myopathy","weight":0.413682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopathy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.202112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.177382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Renal replacement therapy","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Friction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Heel (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Grip strength","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_strength"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"}]}
