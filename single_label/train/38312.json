{"id":38312,"title":"Risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in very-low-birth-weight infants with isolated atrial and ventricular septal defects.","abstract":"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality in premature infants. We sought to identify the frequency of NEC in very-low-birth-weight infants with isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) or atrial septal defects (ASDs) using a large multicenter database.We identified a cohort of infants with birth weight <1500?g cared for in 312 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) managed by the Pediatrix Medical Group between 1997 and 2010. We examined the association between the presence of an ASD or a VSD with development of NEC using logistic regression to control for small-for-gestational age status, antenatal steroid use, antenatal antibiotic use, gestational age, sex, race, Apgar score at 5?min and method of delivery.Of the 98?523 infants who met inclusion criteria, 1904 (1.9%) had an ASD, 1943 (2.0%) had a VSD and 146 (0.1%) had both. The incidence of NEC was 6.2% in infants without septal defects, 9.3% in those with an ASD, 7.8% in those with a VSD, and 10.3% in infants with both an ASD and a VSD. Compared with infants without septal defects, the adjusted odds ratios for developing NEC for each group-ASD alone, VSD alone and ASD with VSD-were 1.26 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.49), 1.27 (1.07 to 1.51) and 1.79 (1.03 to 3.12), respectively.The presence of an ASD or a VSD was associated with NEC in this cohort of premature infants.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434778","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.799238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.793624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.678689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.661552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.584953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.57991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.564861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.388898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Apgar score","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apgar_score"},{"name":"Necrotizing enterocolitis","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrotizing_enterocolitis"},{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.280786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.224581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Anabolic steroid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_steroid"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"}]}
