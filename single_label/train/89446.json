{"id":89446,"title":"Patellofemoral joint: from instability to arthritis.","abstract":"Disorders of the patellofemoral joint are commonly seen in musculoskeletal clinics. In recent years, the expansion of imaging techniques, improvements in correlative injury anatomy, and more focused physical examinations have resulted in new knowledge about patellofemoral disorders. To achieve optimal patient outcomes, it is helpful for orthopaedic surgeons who treat knee problems to review the management of patellar dislocations and isolated patellofemoral arthritis, including treatment algorithms.
