{"id":32692,"title":"[Surgical strategy and the results for hypoplastic left heart syndrome].","abstract":"We retrospectively reviewed our surgical results in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome( HLHS) to investigate the influence of surgical strategy on outcome.Seventy-seven patients with classic HLHS were involved in this study. For the initial palliation, 23 patients underwent Norwood operation with modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt, 23 patients underwent Norwood operation with right ventricle to pulmonary artery( RV-PA) shunt and 31 patients underwent bilateral pulmonary artery banding (BPAB). Surgical results, freedom from Fontan operation, hemodynamic data and incidence of complication after Fontan operation were compared between the 3 groups.BPAB group had more preoperative risk factors than Norwood group. Total actuarial survival was 62.4% at 1 year and 58.2% at 3 and 5 years, and there was no difference between the groups. Freedom from Fontan completion was 59.4% at 3 years and 48.7% at 5 years without difference between the groups. The incidence of intervention for pulmonary artery stenosis was higher in Norwood with RV-PA shunt group(52.9%). Hemodynamic data obtained by cardiac catheterization were similar in the 3 groups, however, end-systolic elastance, which represents ventricular contractility, was lower in Norwood with RV-PA group.Surgical results of Norwood with BT shunt and Norwood with RV-PA shunt were comparably satisfactory, however, there was possible concern of reduced ventricular contractility in RV-PA shunt group. BPAB was a effective and useful initial palliation in high risk cases.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917160","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Cardiac catheterization","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_catheterization"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.767585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Left heart","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_heart"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome","weight":0.730755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplastic_left_heart_syndrome"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.721216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.665601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.639178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Hypoplasia","weight":0.301218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplasia"},{"name":"Contractility","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractility"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"}]}
