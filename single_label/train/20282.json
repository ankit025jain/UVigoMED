{"id":20282,"title":"Fever in the returning child traveller: approach to diagnosis and management.","abstract":"During the last half century there has been an exponential increase in international travel including to more exotic and long-haul destinations. The assessment of febrile returning child travellers presents diagnostic challenges and is often performed poorly. A detailed travel and medical history, clinical examination and appropriate first-line investigations are essential. While the majority of children will have a common self-limiting or easily treatable infection, it is important to consider other causes, including imported infections, which may be life-threatening or highly contagious. In this article, we provide guidance on the initial assessment and management of such children with a focus on some of the more important imported infections, including malaria, dengue, typhoid fever, travellers' diarrhoea, respiratory infections, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and rickettsial diseases.","date":"2014-09-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667950","annotations":[{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Typhoid fever","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Rickettsia","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickettsia"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.537436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Contagious disease","weight":0.518059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagious_disease"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Exponential growth","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Travel","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Introduced species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
