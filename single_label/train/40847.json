{"id":40847,"title":"Effect of tumor necrosis factor-? inhibitors on drug-induced pancreatitis in inflammatory bowel disease.","abstract":"Mesalamine and thiopurines (6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have been shown to increase the risk of developing acute pancreatitis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) inhibitors have been shown to protect against pancreatitis in animal models.To determine the risk of pancreatitis when comparing thiopurine monotherapy, mesalamine monotherapy, and thiopurine and mesalamine dual therapy to identical treatments but with the addition of a TNF-? inhibitor.Using a case-control design, the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System was queried for cases of pancreatitis and control reactions in IBD patients on a thiopurine or mesalamine. The proportional reporting ratio method was used to compare the different therapy regimens with the same regimen combined with a TNF-? inhibitor.In all, 549 cases and controls were identified. When comparing thiopurine monotherapy with thiopurines combined with a TNF-? inhibitor, the odds of pancreatitis were lower in those on combination therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.04; 95% CI = 0.01-0.12). A similar trend was seen when comparing mesalamine monotherapy to mesalamine combined with a TNF-? inhibitor (OR = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.04-0.14) and when comparing those on both a thiopurine and mesalamine with those on all 3 therapies (OR = 0.04; 95% CI = 0.01-0.16).Combination therapy with TNF-? inhibitors appears to be associated with a lower risk of pancreatitis in IBD patients on mesalamine, thiopurines, or a combination of both. Physicians should consider using TNF-? inhibitors in those with the greatest risk of pancreatitis, although prospective studies are needed.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982311","annotations":[{"name":"Azathioprine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathioprine"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.844041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Acute pancreatitis","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.768994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Mercaptopurine","weight":0.727001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercaptopurine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mesalazine","weight":0.526941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesalazine"},{"name":"TNF inhibitor","weight":0.422041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNF_inhibitor"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.338221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.166752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Thiopurine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiopurine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
