{"id":35053,"title":"Clinical application and diagnostic value of noninvasive spinal angiography in spinal vascular malformations.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to explore the value of computed tomographic (CT) spinal angiography with 256-slice CT and fast dynamic contrast-enhanced 3-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) at 3.0 T in the diagnosis of spinal vascular malformations.Seventeen patients who presented with suspected spinal vascular diseases by initial magnetic resonance and clinical findings all underwent CT spinal angiography. Among these, 10 patients underwent MRA, 15 patients underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) within 3 to 5 days, and 8 patients finally underwent surgical treatment.Computed tomographic angiography examination clearly showed the abnormal vascular lesions in 16 of the 17 patients, including 7 patients with the diagnosis of spinal dural arteriovenous fistula, 7 patients with perimedullary arteriovenous fistula, and 2 patients with spinal arteriovenous malformations. The results were consistent with the diagnosis of DSA or surgery. One patient was poorly diagnosed. The fistulas could be seen in 12 patients; feeding arteries were correctly displayed in 12 patients. The fistulas and feeding arteries were accurately shown in 7 of 10 patients by MRA; DSA results were also negative in the other 3 patients.Spinal angiography with 256-slice CT and contrast-enhanced MRA at 3.0 T can clearly show the extent of spinal vascular malformations, feeding arteries, and fistulas. They are safe, noninvasive, as well as rapid and can shorten the time of DSA diagnosis and treatment.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681867","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.662989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dura mater","weight":0.591379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura_mater"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.559091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.534242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.469465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Arteriovenous fistula","weight":0.405063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_fistula"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance angiography","weight":0.402819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_angiography"},{"name":"Digital subtraction angiography","weight":0.398967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subtraction_angiography"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
