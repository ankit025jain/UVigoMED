{"id":36004,"title":"Changes of lipoproteins in phenylalanine hydroxylase-deficient children during the first year of life.","abstract":"Influence of hyperphenylalaninemia on lipoproteins in early life remains unclear.We enrolled 24 phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH)-deficient children who were classified into a phenylketonuria (PKU) group (n=12) lacking PAH activity and a benign hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) group (n=12) having partial PAH activity, and their 11 non-affected siblings. We measured serum total-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels together with apolipoproteins for the first year of life, and compared them with those of 30 age-matched healthy controls.The affected groups invariably had lower cholesterol levels than non-affected groups. At birth, HDL-cholesterol decrease was greatest and predominated over the LDL-cholesterol decrease: total cholesterol, 28/36% decrease to the control level in HPA/PKU; HDL-cholesterol, 33/51%; LDL-cholesterol, 20/28%. At 3months, the opposite changes were observed: total cholesterol, 16/28%; HDL-cholesterol, 13/23%; LDL-cholesterol, 16/33%. At 12months, LDL were still significantly lower in both groups (8/18%, p<.05 and .001), although HDL was significantly decreased only in the PKU group (15%, p<.05). Apolipoprotein A-I/A-II and B changed respectively in accordance with HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol changes. Despite similar phenylalanine levels, the PKU group invariably had lower cholesterol concentrations than the HPA group had.Irrespective of phenylalanine concentrations, lipoprotein synthesis in PAH-deficient children, particularly in PKU children, was suppressed in early life.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607329","annotations":[{"name":"Phenylalanine","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Phenylketonuria","weight":0.793108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Hydroxylation","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylation"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein","weight":0.637187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.624697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.365734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.246629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Phenylalanine hydroxylase","weight":0.242222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine_hydroxylase"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.110637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"1628","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1628"},{"name":"818","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/818"},{"name":"1323","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1323"},{"name":"2028","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2028"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal_axis"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Nitrogen group","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_group"}]}
