{"id":90007,"title":"Occlusion of brachial pseudoaneurysm after periprosthetic humerus fracture.","abstract":"Pseudoaneurysms of the brachial artery are rare and most often occur after a penetrating injury. The incidence of periprosthetic humerus fractures is low, and surgical treatment can be demanding. The treatment of choice for an occluded pseudoaneurysm of the brachial artery is saphenous vein bypass. In this article, we report the case of a 73-year-old woman who presented with an occluded pseudoaneurysm of the brachial artery sustained after a neglected periprosthetic humerus fracture. A saphenous vein bypass was performed after removal of the distal tip of the prosthesis. Patency was observed 3 months after surgery. This case shows malunion of a neglected periprosthetic humerus fracture and a good result after saphenous vein bypass.
