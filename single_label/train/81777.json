{"id":81777,"title":"Interactive treatment planning in toothwear: are we doing it right?","abstract":"Toothwear is now common, especially in younger patients, with high demand for the restoration of the damaged teeth which is likely to increase further over time. Fixed prosthodontic options range from direct composite resin to conventional tooth preparation and cemented indirect restorations. This paper summarizes the views of a variety of clinicians on a plan delivered to a patient with toothwear in secondary care and explores the possible reasons for the variation in decision-making in the treatment of toothwear.With levels of toothwear increasing, the clinician needs to be aware of the different treatment modalities which are appropriate.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839708","annotations":[{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.204122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.138374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Secondary care","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_care"},{"name":"Prosthodontics","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthodontics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0201095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Mountain range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Building restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_restoration"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Dental composite","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_composite"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Supply and demand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Interactivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactivity"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Restoration ecology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_ecology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
