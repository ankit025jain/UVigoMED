{"id":29595,"title":"Datura stramonium toxicity mistakenly diagnosed as \"bath salt\" intoxication: a case report.","abstract":"Datura stramonium is a wildly growing plant found in West Virginia and in temperate regions throughout the world that is sometimes abused by young people because of its hallucinogenic effects. D. Stramonium overdose produces a classic anticholinergic syndrome that can lead to severe and sometimes fatal complications. Poisoning can be confused with more commonly seen drugs of abuse, particularly synthetic drugs which are not revealed by standard drug screens. Misdiagnosis can delay appropriate care and potentially lead to poorer outcomes. We present a case of a 15 year-old male with acute D. Stramonium poisoning initially misdiagnosed with bath salt intoxication who required treatment by two emergency departments, a pediatric ICU, and who was ultimately transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility. We then discuss differential diagnosis of D. Stramonium poisoning and bath salt intoxication and present management strategies for the two conditions.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced
