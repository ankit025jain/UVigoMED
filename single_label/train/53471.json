{"id":53471,"title":"Expression and prognostic significance of APE1/Ref-1 and NPM1 proteins in high-grade ovarian serous cancer.","abstract":"To correlate the expression profile of human apurinic endonuclease/redox factor 1 (APE1/Ref-1) with that of nucleolar/nucleoplasmic protein nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) in association with the aggressiveness and progression of high-grade ovarian serous cancer.Retrospective study analyzing a tissue microarray of 73 women affected by high-grade ovarian serous cancer. Protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry on primary tumor masses and synchronous peritoneal metastases if present.APE1/Ref-1 and NPM1 showed a significant correlation in ovarian serous cancer. Patients with a poorer outcome showed a significant overexpression of nuclear NPM1 protein. A Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression model revealed NPM1 expression to be independently significant for overall survival in high-grade ovarian serous cancers after correcting for stage, age, cytoreduction completeness, and platinum resistance.APE1/Ref-1 interacts with NPM1 to control the DNA damage repair system, and it is likely that this interaction plays a defining role in high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma. A high NPM1 immunohistochemical expression was independently correlated with a shorter survival period and thus appears to be an important prognostic factor.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24515769","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue microarray","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_microarray"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Purine","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purine"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.700903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.590129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.583329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.546441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.536006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.381416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Serous carcinoma","weight":0.281209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_carcinoma"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.234315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"NPM1","weight":0.219746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPM1"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
