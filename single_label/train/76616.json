They prefer high-energy diets, but of poor nutritional value. Patients qualified for bariatric procedures show deficiencies in vitamins and minerals due to insufficient intake of vegetables, fruit and whole grain products.Analysis of dietary habits in morbidly obese patients prepared for bariatric surgery, including assessment of eating style and frequency of consumption of certain products.The study group contained 39 people aged 18 - 65 years, who were surveyed with a questionnaire elaborated in the Department of Clinical Dietetics and Nutrition, Medical University of Bialystok. The following factors were assessed: number of meals, snacking between meals and eating at night, types of snacks eaten, and frequency of consumption of certain foods. Results were analyzed using Statistica 9.0.The majority of surveyed men (41.7%) ate three meals a day, whereas most women (40.7%) had at least 4 meals a day. Nearly 85% of the respondents admitted snacking between meals, mainly eating fruit, sweets and sandwiches. Whole grain cereal, milk and dairy products, fish, fruit, vegetables and pulses appeared in diet of patients qualified for treatment of obesity very rarely.Dietary habits of obese patients qualified for bariatric procedures are not consistent with recommendations. Therefore, these patients should receive nutritional education in order to foster proper eating habits that will help in the postoperative nutrition.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964578","annotations":[{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Whole grain","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_grain"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Cereal","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal"},{"name":"Vegetable","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable"},{"name":"Snack food","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snack_food"},{"name":"Confectionery","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confectionery"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Dairy","weight":0.721555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy"},{"name":"Dairy product","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product"},{"name":"Dietitian","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian"},{"name":"Sandwich","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich"},{"name":"Pulse (legume)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(legume)"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.531224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Bariatric surgery","weight":0.22763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.171842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.0732229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Seudah Shlishit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seudah_Shlishit"}]}
