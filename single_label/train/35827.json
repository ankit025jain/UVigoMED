{"id":35827,"title":"[Recurrent aneuploidy in first trimester gestational loss: a case report and review of the literature].","abstract":"Miscarriage is the loss of pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestation and occurs in 15% of clinically recognized pregnancies. However, 5% of couples present recurrent abortion, which means more than two losses whether consecutive or not. One of the main causes of both, spontaneous and recurrent abortion, are genetic. Within it, chromosomal abnormalities are the most important. So far, the only risk factor that has been clearly defined is maternal age. Nevertheless, in patients with recurrent abortion, there has been research on some other factors that generate a greater predisposition to aneuploidy, and consequently, recurrent abortion risk. One of the mechanisms that may be the link between aneuploidy risk and maternal age is the level of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH). This is due to the fact that elevated levels of Follicle Stimulating Hormone have been found to modify the morphology of meiotic spindles, which in turn leads to a higher risk of aneuploidy. In this article we present a literature review on the subject, as well as the case of a patient with two abortions, one of them with trisomy 13, and the other with trisomy 18.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620528","annotations":[{"name":"Aneuploidy","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy"},{"name":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Advanced maternal age","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_maternal_age"},{"name":"Meiosis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis"},{"name":"Patau syndrome","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patau_syndrome"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.702572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Edwards syndrome","weight":0.688919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwards_syndrome"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.368303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Spindle apparatus","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_apparatus"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
