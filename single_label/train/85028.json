{"id":85028,"title":"Determinants of differentials in pneumonia mortality in the UK and France.","abstract":"Pneumonia is one of the major causes of death in the world. Age-adjusted mortality from pneumonia in the United Kingdom was three times higher than it was in France in 2004. The purpose of this article is to find the underlying determinants of pneumonia mortality differences between these two countries. The main research question is \"what are the determinants of pneumonia mortality in the UK and France?\" Reviewing the underlying determinants of health inequalities, we expected that behavioral factors, environmental factors, and the health care system would account for the differences, but they do not actually account for much of the differences in Pneumonia mortality between the UK and France. The main difference is due to data quality problems particularly relating to diagnosis and certification in both countries.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25223162","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.658592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.598141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.573737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Health equity","weight":0.572136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.458195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.383484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.351152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"France","weight":0.204275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Social determinants of health","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Certification","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Economic inequality","weight":0.0239857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Allopatric speciation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric_speciation"}]}
