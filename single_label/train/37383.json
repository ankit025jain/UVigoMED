{"id":37383,"title":"Palmoplantar keratoderma along with neuromuscular and metabolic phenotypes in Slurp1-deficient mice.","abstract":"Mutations in SLURP1 cause mal de Meleda, a rare palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK). SLURP1 is a secreted protein that is expressed highly in keratinocytes but has also been identified elsewhere (e.g., spinal cord neurons). Here, we examined Slurp1-deficient mice (Slurp1(-/-)) created by replacing exon 2 with ?-gal and neo cassettes. Slurp1(-/-) mice developed severe PPK characterized by increased keratinocyte proliferation, an accumulation of lipid droplets in the stratum corneum, and a water barrier defect. In addition, Slurp1(-/-) mice exhibited reduced adiposity, protection from obesity on a high-fat diet, low plasma lipid levels, and a neuromuscular abnormality (hind-limb clasping). Initially, it was unclear whether the metabolic and neuromuscular phenotypes were due to Slurp1 deficiency, because we found that the targeted Slurp1 mutation reduced the expression of several neighboring genes (e.g., Slurp2, Lypd2). We therefore created a new line of knockout mice (Slurp1X(-/-) mice) with a simple nonsense mutation in exon 2. The Slurp1X mutation did not reduce the expression of adjacent genes, but Slurp1X(-/-) mice exhibited all of the phenotypes observed in the original line of knockout mice. Thus, Slurp1 deficiency in mice elicits metabolic and neuromuscular abnormalities in addition to PPK.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499735","annotations":[{"name":"Stratum corneum","weight":0.896253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_corneum"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.824742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Keratinocyte","weight":0.802825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.320291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.301841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Nonsense mutation","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense_mutation"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"Palmoplantar keratoderma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmoplantar_keratoderma"},{"name":"Meleda disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meleda_disease"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Gallon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallon"},{"name":"Dam","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Keratoderma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoderma"},{"name":"Osteonectin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteonectin"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Nonsense","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
