{"id":73729,"title":"ATL-1, a synthetic analog of lipoxin, modulates endothelial permeability and interaction with tumor cells through a VEGF-dependent mechanism.","abstract":"Lipoxins (LX) and 15-epi-LX are lipids with a potent inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, in different models in vivo and in vitro. ATL-1, a synthetic analog of 15-epi-LXA4, inhibits various actions stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, LX actions on endothelial cells (EC) in tumor-related contexts are still unknown. Here, we investigated the modulation of EC by ATL-1, in a model that mimics tumor extravasation. We observed that the analog inhibited endothelial permeability induced by VEGF, through the stabilization of VE-cadherin/?-catenin-dependent adherens junctions. We tested the ability of MV3 cells, a highly metastatic melanoma cell line, to transmigrate across unchallenged EC monolayers for 18 h, as compared to NGM normal melanocytes. ATL-1 was able to inhibit only melanoma extravasation. MV3 cells secrete large amounts of VEGF and we observed that ATL-1 per se did not alter this ability. Melanoma cells skills to crossing endothelial monolayers were due to the steady accumulation of tumor-derived VEGF. When endothelial cells were challenged with exogenous VEGF, added at levels comparable to those secreted by MV3 cells over 18 h, and a short-term (4h) transendothelial migration assay was performed, both melanoma and melanocyte cells were able to extravasate, and ATL-1 was able to block the passage of both cells. These results indicate that ATL-1 has a potent inhibitory effect on the permeability induced by VEGF, and that this pharmacological effect could be used to block tumor extravasation across endothelial barriers, with a possible prospect of reducing the haematogenic spread of cancer cells.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24887589","annotations":[{"name":"Melanocyte","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.641133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Extravasation","weight":0.626518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravasation"},{"name":"Vascular permeability","weight":0.534796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_permeability"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.493416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.409057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.382159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.150375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Lipoxin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoxin"},{"name":"Chemotaxis assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis_assay"},{"name":"Leukocyte extravasation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocyte_extravasation"},{"name":"European Commission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Gap junction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_junction"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Monolayer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolayer"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Reincarnation","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation"}]}
