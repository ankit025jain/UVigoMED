{"id":92182,"title":"Pressure induced lung injury in a novel in vitro model of the alveolar interface: protective effect of dexamethasone.","abstract":"The lungs of infants born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia suffer from immaturity as well as the short and long term consequences of ventilator-induced lung injury, including chronic lung disease. Antenatal and postnatal steroids are among current strategies promoted to treat premature lungs and limit long term morbidity. Although studied in whole-animal models, insight into ventilator-induced injury at the alveolar-capillary interface as well as the benefits of steroids, remains limited. The present study utilizes a multi-fluidic in vitro model of the alveolar-interface to analyze membrane disruption from compressive aerodynamic forces in dexamethasone-treated cultures.Human alveolar epithelial cell lines, H441 and A549, were cultured in a custom-built chamber under constant aerodynamic shear followed by introduction of pressure stimuli with and without dexamethasone (0.1?M). On-chip bioelectrical measurements were noted to track changes to the cellular surface and live-dead assay to ascertain cellular viability.Pressure-exposed alveolar cultures demonstrated a significant drop in TEER that was less prominent with an underlying extracellular-matrix coating. Addition of dexamethasone resulted in increased alveolar layer integrity demonstrated by higher TEER values. Furthermore, dexamethasone-treated cells exhibited faster recovery, and the effects of pressure appeared to be mitigated in both cell types.Using a novel in vitro model of the alveolus, we demonstrate a dose-response relationship between pressure application and loss of alveolar layer integrity. This effect appears to be alleviated by dexamethasone and matrix sub-coating.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439582","annotations":[{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.779394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.691373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.501962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.463177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.44967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia","weight":0.392244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchopulmonary_dysplasia"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.331296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_diaphragmatic_hernia"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Shear stress","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Aerodynamics","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Diaphragmatic hernia","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_hernia"},{"name":"Bioelectromagnetism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectromagnetism"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
