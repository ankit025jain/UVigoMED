{"id":12610,"title":"Use of recombinant nucleocapsid proteins for serological diagnosis  offeline coronavirus infection by three immunochromatographic tests.","abstract":"Three types of immunochromatographic assays (ICAs) were designed to detect anti-feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibodies. Recombinant FCoV nucleocapsid protein (rNP) was used as a conjugate or test line in all 3 ICA kits (CJIgG/TNP, CJNP/TNP, and CJNP/TPA). All three ICA kits were capable of detecting anti-FCoV antibodies; however, non-specific positive reactions of anti-FCoV antibody-negative plasma samples with the test line were observed in 2 ICA kits (CJIgG/TNP and CJNP/TNP), in which rNP was used as the test line. On the other hand, the specific detection of anti-FCoV antibodies was possible in all plasma, serum, whole blood, and ascitic fluid samples using the ICA kit with protein A blotted as the test line (CJNP/TPA). In addition, the specificity and sensitivity of ICA (CJNP/TPA) were equivalent to those of the reference ELISA. The development of simple antibody test methods using the principle of ICA (CJNP/TPA) for other coronavirus and feline viral infections is expected in the future.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24516876","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.745705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Whole blood","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_blood"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.655358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Nucleocapsid","weight":0.607061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleocapsid"},{"name":"Coronavirus","weight":0.413038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.265311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.174482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.168212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Protein A","weight":0.164972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_A"},{"name":"Test method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_method"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
