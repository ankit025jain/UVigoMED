{"id":51540,"title":"Hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of oxymatrine in high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.","abstract":"Oxymatrine, a quinolizidine alkaloid, has been widely used for the treatment of hepatitis. In this study, we investigated the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects and new pharmacological activities of oxymatrine, in a high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The results demonstrated that oxymatrine could significantly decrease fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb), food and water intake, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (LDL-c), and increase serum insulin, liver and muscle glycogen, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and muscle glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) content in diabetic rats. The results of the histological examinations of the pancreas and liver show that oxymatrine protected the islet architecture and prevented disordered structure of the liver. This study displays that oxymatrine can alleviate hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia in a high-fat diet and STZ-induced diabetic rats might by improving insulin secretion and sensitivity.
