{"id":72388,"title":"RUNX1T1/MTG8/ETO gene expression status in human t(8;21)(q22;q22)-positive acute myeloid leukemia cells.","abstract":"The RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene, a product of the nonhomologous balanced translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22), is a complex genetic locus. We performed extensive bioinformatic analysis of transcription initiation as well as transcription termination sites in this locus and predicted a number of different RUNX1T1 transcripts. To confirm and quantify the RUNX1T1 gene expression, we analyzed samples from seven acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and from the Kasumi-1 cell line. We found variable activity of the four predicted RUNX1T1 promoters located downstream of the chromosome breakpoint. Nineteen alternative RUNX1T1 transcripts were identified by sequencing at least seventeen of which predictably can be translated into functional proteins. While the RUNX1T1 gene is not expressed in normal hematopoietic cells, it may participate in t(8;21)(q22;q22)-dependent leukemic transformation due to its multiple interactions in cell regulatory network particularly through synergistic or antagonistic effects in relation to activity of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene.
