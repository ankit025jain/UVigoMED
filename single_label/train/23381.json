{"id":23381,"title":"Mortality in a pediatric secondary-care hospital in post-conflict Liberia in 2009.","abstract":"To describe and analyze the causes of death in a pediatric secondary-care hospital (run by Médecins sans Frontières), in Monrovia, Liberia, 6 years post-civil war, to determine the quality of care and mortality in a setting with limited resources.Data were retrospectively collected from March 2009 to October 2009. Patient charts and laboratory records were reviewed to verify cause of death. Additionally, charts of patients aged over 1 month with an infectious cause of death were analyzed for decompensated septic shock, or fluid-refractory septic shock.Of 8,254 admitted pediatric patients, 531 died, with a mortality rate of 6.4%. Ninety percent of deaths occurred in children <5 years old. Most deaths occurred within 24 hours of admission. The main cause of death (76%) was infectious disease. Seventy-eight (23.6%) patients >1 month old with infectious disease met the criteria for septic shock, and 28 (8.6%) for decompensated or fluid-refractory septic shock.Since the end of Liberia's devastating civil war, Island Hospital has improved care and mortality outcomes, despite operating with limited resources. Based on the available data, mortality in Island Hospital appears to be lower than that of other Liberian and African institutions and similar to other hospitals run by Médecins sans Frontières across Africa. This can be explained by the financial and logistic support of Médecins sans Frontières. The highest mortality burden is related to infectious diseases and neonatal conditions. The mortality of sepsis varied among different infections. This suggests that further mortality reduction can be obtained by tackling sepsis management and improving neonatal care.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488377","annotations":[{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.811277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.619457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Septic shock","weight":0.574944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.507473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"War","weight":0.492032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"},{"name":"Liberia","weight":0.491585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.404822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Civil war","weight":0.307432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.141231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0425622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Monrovia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monrovia"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Neonatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatology"},{"name":"Mozambican Civil War","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambican_Civil_War"},{"name":"Civil and political rights","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
