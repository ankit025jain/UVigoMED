{"id":37471,"title":"Epigenetic regulation of epidermal differentiation.","abstract":"In a cell, the chromatin state is controlled by the highly regulated interplay of epigenetic mechanisms ranging from DNA methylation and incorporation of different histone variants to posttranslational modification of histones and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. These changes alter the structure of the chromatin to either facilitate or restrict the access of transcription machinery to DNA. These epigenetic modifications function to exquisitely orchestrate the expression of different genes, and together constitute the epigenome of a cell. In the skin, different epigenetic regulators form a regulatory network that operates to guarantee skin stem cell maintenance while controlling differentiation to multiple skin structures. In this review, we will discuss recent findings on epigenetic mechanisms of skin control and their relationship to skin pathologies.
