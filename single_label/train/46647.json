{"id":46647,"title":"Proteomic biomarker predicts therapeutical effects of oxaliplatin combining with fluoropyrimidine in metastatic gastric cancer patients by the SELDI-proteinchip platform.","abstract":"To evaluate potential protein markers for oxaliplatin-based first-line chemotherapy of metastatic gastric cancer (MGC), we have used proteomic analysis to compare the difference of serum proteomic spectra between responsive and non-responsive MGC patients.Serum samples were collected before chemotherapy.Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionisation time of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) proteinchip array technology was applied to compare the differences of serous protein spectra between the twenty responsive patients and another fourteen non responsive patients. Cross validation was applied to identify the proper markers for an accurate judgment of prognosis.Fifty proteins were picked out for significantly increased or decreased expression(p<0.05, Student t-test). Among them, sixteen protein masses with 1081, 1267, 2941, 2985, 3148, 3165,3199, 3219, 3249, 3281, 4182, 4390, 4482, 4509,4533 and 5001 m/z were chosen as components of the best proteomic biomarker pattern for judgment of chemotherapy prognosis in MGC patients, achieving a sensitivity of 95% (19/20) and a specificity of 78.6%(11/14), respectively.SELDI-TOF-MS screens out the specific protein markers that help oncologists with judging the prognosis of oxaliplatin in combination with fluoropyrimidine, thus orientating first-line palliative chemotherapy for MGC patients.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624447","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.901242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.794734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.707167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.579824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.321605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.209541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0860629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"}]}
