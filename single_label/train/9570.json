{"id":9570,"title":"Three-dimensional visualization of rat brain microvasculature following permanent focal ischaemia by synchrotron radiation.","abstract":"Identifying morphological changes that occur in microvessels under both normal and ischaemic conditions is crucial for understanding and treating stroke. However, conventional imaging techniques are not able to detect microvessels on a micron or sub-micron scale without angiography. In the present study, synchrotron radiation (SR)-based X-ray in-line phase contrast imaging (ILPCI) was used to acquire high-resolution and high-contrast images of rat brain tissues in both normal and ischaemic states.ILPCI was performed at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai, China, without the use of contrast agents. CT slices were reformatted and then converted into three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction images to analyse subtle details of the cerebral microvascular network.By using ILPCI, brain vessels up to 11.8 ?m in diameter were resolved. The number of cortical and penetrating arteries detected were found to undergo a remarkable decrease within the infarct area. 3 days after permanent ischaemia, vascular masses were also observed in the peripheral region of the infarcts.SR-based ILPCI-CT can serve as a powerful tool to accurately visualize brain microvasculature. The morphological parameters of blood vessels in both CT slices and 3D reconstructions were determined, and this approach has great potential for providing an effective diagnosis and evaluation for rehabilitation therapy for stroke.In the absence of contrast agent, the 3D morphologies of the brain microvasculature in normal and stroke rats were obtained using SR-based ILPCI. SR imaging is a sensitive and promising method which can be used to explore primary brain function.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Animal
