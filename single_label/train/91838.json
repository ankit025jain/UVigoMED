{"id":91838,"title":"Patients' point of view on informed consent: a prospective study in carpal tunnel surgery.","abstract":"Patients' perception of consent form (CF) is not well known and many patients tend to view the CF as an administrative act. As part of a prospective study, a questionnaire was sent to 188 consecutive patients within 1 month after carpal tunnel release. Questions focused on patients' recall about risks, benefits, alternative options, preferences about decisions process and global satisfaction with CF. Patient's understanding of the legal consequences of the CF was analysed. Risk's recall rate was 59%. CF reduced preoperative anxiety in 65% and the influence in patients' decision was relevant in 55% of cases. Patients have limited understanding of the legal consequences of the consensus and 29% of patients believed that primary function was to protect hospital. Ten percent believed that CF expunges patients' right to compensation in case of claims. Patient involvement in medical decision-making is a key aspect of patient centred care. A substantial uncertainty exists about legal implication of CF, leading to potential discord.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471151","annotations":[{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.835292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.659617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.341325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.316419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.218581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Uncertainty","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Recall election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election"},{"name":"Television advertisement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_advertisement"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Narrative mode","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_mode"},{"name":"Carpal tunnel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
