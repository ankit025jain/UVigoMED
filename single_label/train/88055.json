{"id":88055,"title":"Platelet factor 4 protects bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from acute radiation injury.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to find a new radiation protector, platelet factor 4 (PF4) and to identify its effect on haemopoietic microenvironment in vitro and in vivo.Radiation damage on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ex and in vitro was set up as models. Growth curve analysis, clonogenic survival assay, FACSCaliburâ„¢ (BD Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine immunofluorescence staining and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were employed to assess the characterization of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle and gene expression.A dose- and time-dependent enhancement of cell viability and survival was observed for PF4 treatment along with 500 cGy ?-radiation in vitro. The same phenomena were noted in vivo, including enhancement of adherence and proliferation ability while inhibition of cell apoptosis, which were associated with a short-term decrease in the G0/G1 ratio owing to S phase arrest. These were accompanied with enhanced Bcl-2 expression and p53/p21 loss.These results uncover that PF4 might be a novel therapeutic approach, which could reduce DNA damage and increase survival of BMSCs, in part, by inhibiting p53/p21 axis and facilitating DNA damage repair.This study explores the feasibility of a new radioprotector and hence may be clinically important.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Wounds and
