{"id":50905,"title":"Risk factors influencing the surgical outcome in 138 consecutive patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysm: experience at the Cluj-Napoca Cardiovascular Surgery Center.","abstract":"Abdominal aortic aneurysms represent a common pathologic condition, with an increasing incidence in the last decades. Unfortunately, the mortality rate in ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms has also increased. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the risk factors that could interfere with the surgical outcome of these patients, especially with the perioperative morbidity and mortality rates.In this study we included 138 consecutive patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysm, who underwent elective repair (for chronic aortic aneurysm) or emergency repair (for ruptured aortic aneurysm), in the Cluj-Napoca Cardiovascular Surgery Clinic between January 2003 and December 2011. We noted the most frequently associated diseases and perioperative complications among the studied population. Three types of interventions were performed:tubular graft interposition, aortobiiliac bypass and aortobifemoral bypass.The perioperative mortality in the elective repair group was 5.68% (5 - 88), while in the emergency repair group it was 46% (23 - 50).Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm continues to represent a condition associated with substantial risks and high mortality. Selective screening and elective repair are therefore necessary for the improvement of the survival rate for patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysm.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742415","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.804062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.799312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.726208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Perioperative mortality","weight":0.21466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative_mortality"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Cardiothoracic surgery","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiothoracic_surgery"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.117418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Abdominal aortic aneurysm","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Abdominal aorta","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aorta"}]}
