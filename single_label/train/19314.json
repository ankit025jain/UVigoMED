{"id":19314,"title":"High-throughput multiplex MIRU-VNTR typing of Mycobacterium bovis.","abstract":"Spoligotyping is the most widely used method for genotyping Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis). However, its discriminatory power varies widely between countries. MIRU-VNTR typing could be a promising alternative, although it generally requires the time consuming and laborious simplex PCR assays using standard agarose gel electrophoresis. The accuracy of this approach depends on good standardization and a certain degree of expertise. This study presents a version of MIRU-VNTR based on three triplex PCRs with automatic allelic assignation of the products analyzed in capillary electrophoresis. The technique was prospectively applied to 44 M. bovis and two Mycobacterium caprae (M. caprae) isolates, and 22 different MIRU-VNTRtypes were obtained; with spoligotyping, only 14 different types were obtained. The proposal makes it possible to shorten response times, automate procedures, and increase accuracy, thus minimizing errors in assigning genotypes. It would enable the switch from a standard limited method of genotyping M. bovis to a high-throughput discriminatory fingerprinting approach.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726022","annotations":[{"name":"Agarose gel electrophoresis","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agarose_gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.713286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.650644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.537356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Capillary electrophoresis","weight":0.507659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.361745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.205308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.185993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.134872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Fingerprint","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Mycobacterium bovis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_bovis"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Switch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch"},{"name":"Simplex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex"},{"name":"Response time (technology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_time_(technology)"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Automatic transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Typing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing"},{"name":"Duplex (building)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(building)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Multiplexing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.0113784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"}]}
