{"id":76053,"title":"[Effects of vitamins deficiency on the cytochrome P450 inducibility in rats].","abstract":"The purpose of the study was to determine multi-vitamin deficiency effects on the inducibility of main isoforms of cytochrome P450 in the rat liver. The study was carried out on 4 groups of Wistar rats. Rats of the 1st and 3rd group received semi-synthetic diets containing adequate (100% of recommended vitamin level) level of vitamins, the 2nd and 4th--the semi-synthetic diet containing vitamins in the amount of 20% from adequate level. The duration of the experiment was 4 weeks. During the last week indole-3-carbinol (I-3-C) in dose of 20 mg/kg body weight was added to the diet of the 3rd and 4th group of rats. Vitamin E content in liver and blood serum declined by 59 and 34%, respectively in rats which were fed vitamin-deficient diet (2nd group); vitamin A level decreased by 5 times in the liver, but was not changed in blood serum. Multi-vitamin deficiency in the diet led to the increase in the liver ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (EROD) activity of CYP1A1, methoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (MROD) activity of CYP1A2 and testosteron 6beta-hydroxylase (6beta-TG) activity of CYP3A by 11, 80 and 53%, respectively, and gene expression of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP3A and AhR by 8,5; 1,6; 2,4 and 3,6 fold. In rats fed diet with adequate levels of vitamins (3rd group) I-3-C increased activity of EROD and MROD by 4,4 and 5,5 fold, and the expression of CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and AhR genes by 148; 3 and 3,5 fold compared to the parameters of the 1st group (without I-3-C). Multi-vitamin deficiency increased I-3-C-related induction of EROD activity and expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes, but decreased I-3-C-related induction of the MROD activity. Thus, 5-fold reducing of vitamin content in rat diet lead to significant changes in activity and inducibility of cytochrome P450 of CYP1A and 3A family, which play a key role in the detoxification and metabolism of drugs.","date":"2014-10-10","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25300103","annotations":[{"name":"Multivitamin","weight":0.89675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivitamin"},{"name":"Indole","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indole"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.872543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.837718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Vitamin A","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.793414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.711684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Methanol","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol"},{"name":"Detoxification","weight":0.68384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.480921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.449404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Semisynthesis","weight":0.435869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semisynthesis"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.428011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Cytochrome","weight":0.274704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.241109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"CYP1A2","weight":0.194746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP1A2"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor","weight":0.0546422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450, family 1, member A1","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450,_family_1,_member_A1"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Wistar rat","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wistar_rat"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"}]}
