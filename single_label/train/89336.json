{"id":89336,"title":"Evaluation of in vitro macrophage response and in vivo host response to growth factors incorporated chitosan nanoparticle impregnated collagen-chitosan scaffold.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro macrophage compatibility, the inflammatory response and in vivo host response to a novel collagen-chitosan (COL-CS) scaffold containing growth factors incorporated Chitosan Nanoparticle (CNP). The scaffold was obtained by freezing a blend of COL-CS solution and growth factor incorporated CNP followed by lyophilization. High Resolution Transmission Electron Micrograph (HR-TEM) indicated that growth factors incorporated CNP were in the size range of 50-100 nm, while Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) analysis of the scaffold surface suggests that the pores of the scaffolds (COL-CS) were well interconnected, with a mean diameter of 75-150 microm. Macrophages grown on growth factors containing scaffold exhibited poor inflammatory response compared to scaffold without growth factors. In vivo biocompatibility and host response study of scaffold was performed by subcutaneous implantation and examination of the implanted material on day 3 and 15 post implant. The dual growth factors viz. EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) and FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) incorporated implant showed a distinct fibrous capsule boundary on the surface. Secondly, the immunofluoresence assay and zymography respectively for TNFalpha and MMP9 exhibited low expression of these inflammatory markers. These observations divulge that the growth factors when incorporated, can suppress the inflammatory properties of the scaffolds and thus such scaffolds could be used in tissue engineering for minimal host response and enhanced tissue-scaffold interaction.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Wounds and
