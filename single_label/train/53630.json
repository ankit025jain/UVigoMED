{"id":53630,"title":"An integrated framework for automatic Ki-67 scoring in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.","abstract":"The Ki-67 labeling index is a valid and important biomarker to gauge neuroendocrine tumor cell progression. Automatic Ki-67 assessment is very challenging due to complex variations of cell characteristics. In this paper, we propose an integrated learning-based framework for accurate Ki-67 scoring in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. The main contributions of our method are: a novel and robust cell detection algorithm is designed to localize both tumor and non-tumor cells; a repulsive deformable model is applied to correct touching cell segmentation; a two stage learning-based scheme combining cellular features and regional structure information is proposed to differentiate tumor from non-tumor cells (such as lymphocytes); an integrated automatic framework is developed to accurately assess the Ki-67 labeling index. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on 101 tissue microarray (TMA) whole discs, and the cell detection performance is comparable to manual annotations. The automatic Ki-67 score is very accurate compared with pathologists' estimation.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505696","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.719261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.69991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.583299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.485979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.420556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.371845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Tissue microarray","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_microarray"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.354764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.234985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.200993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.0453442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Annotation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotation"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Deformation (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Track gauge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge"},{"name":"Automatic transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"},{"name":"Multistage rocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket"},{"name":"Segmentation (image processing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(image_processing)"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
