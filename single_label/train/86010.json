{"id":86010,"title":"[Nasal surgery and upper airway radiofrequency ablation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome].","abstract":"To investigate the efficacy and related factors of nasal surgery combined with upper air way radiofrequency ablation(RFA) for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) with chronic nasal blockage.One hundred and three mild or moderate OSAHS patients with chronic nasal blockage were recruited, all cases had nasal surgery and upper airway RFA. All patients were evaluated by body mass index (BMI), Epworth sleep scale (ESS), snoring scale, and nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). Eighty-nine patients were reevaluated at least 6 months after surgery with the preoperative methods.After operation, the apnea and hypopnea index (AHI) decreased from (18.67 +/- 9.48)/h to (9.22 +/- 7.18)/h; the lowest artery oxygen saturation (LSaO2) increased from (0.83 +/- 0.08) to (0.92 +/- 0.06); the Epworth sleep scale(ESS) decreased from (8.74 +/- 5.67) to (5.12 +/- 3.74); the snoring scale decreased from (7.16 +/- 2.85) to (3.56 +/- 2.26), the percentage of time with oxyhemoglobin saturation below 0.90 (CT90) decreased from (18.64 +/- 12.98) to (10.73 +/- 8.29). All of the differences were obvious (P<0.01). Success was defined as a postoperative apnea-hypopnea in dex < 10 events per hour and at least 50% less than the preoperative value. The surgical success rate was 75.3% (67/89). No major perioperative complications occurred.Our findings suggest that nasal surgery combined with upper airway RFA can improve snoring and disease-specific quality of life in patients with anatomic na sal obstruction with mild or moderate OSAHS.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24826449","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Radiofrequency ablation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofrequency_ablation"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.690485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.665493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Snoring","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoring"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.484519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Hypopnea","weight":0.438889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopnea"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.420555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.409965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Nasal cavity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity"},{"name":"Apnea-hypopnea index","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea-hypopnea_index"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"}]}
