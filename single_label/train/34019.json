{"id":34019,"title":"Exome sequencing helped the fine diagnosis of two siblings afflicted with atypical Timothy syndrome (TS2).","abstract":"Long-QT syndrome (LQTS) causes a prolongation of the QT-interval in the ECG leading to life threatening tachyarrhythmia and ventricular fibrillation. One atypical form of LQTS, Timothy syndrome (TS), is associated with syndactyly, immune deficiency, cognitive and neurological abnormalities as well as distinct cranio-facial abnormalities.On a family with both children diagnosed with clinical LQTS, we performed whole exome sequencing to comprehensively screen for causative mutations after a targeted candidate gene panel screen for Long-QT syndrome target genes failed to identify any underlying genetic defect. Using exome sequencing, we identified in both affected children, a p.402G > S mutation in exon 8 of the CACNA1C gene, a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. The mutation was inherited from their father, a mosaic mutation carrier. Based on this molecular finding and further more careful clinical examination, we refined the diagnosis to be Timothy syndrome (TS2) and thereby were able to present new therapeutic approaches.Our study highlights the difficulties in accurate diagnosis of patients with rare diseases, especially those with atypical clinical manifestation. Such challenge could be addressed with the help of comprehensive and unbiased mutation screening, such as exome sequencing.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal
