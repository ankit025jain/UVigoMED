{"id":67714,"title":"Stigma and microaggressions experienced by older women with urinary incontinence: a literature review.","abstract":"This literature review investigated stigma and identified episodes of microaggressions experienced by women with urinary incontinence. Three significant themes were revealed: lack of disclosure from psychological distress, microaggressions resulting from stigma, and factors associated with the intersections of gender, race, and ethnicity. Nursing implications include earning and maintaining patient trust, and demonstrating sensitivity about urinary incontinence.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592523","annotations":[{"name":"Gender","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Social stigma","weight":0.541396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.45135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.391224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.328812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.212202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Trust (social sciences)","weight":0.146946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"},{"name":"Intersectionality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality"},{"name":"Health effects from noise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_from_noise"}]}
