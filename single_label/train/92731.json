{"id":92731,"title":"HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 abrogates up-regulation of RTKs by mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 and potentiates its antiproliferative activity in human breast cancer.","abstract":"mTOR inhibition led to activation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and AKT, which may attenuate the efficacy of mTOR kinase inhibitors. We sought to discover efficient drug combination with mTOR inhibitors by elucidating the survival feedback loops induced by mTOR inhibition in breast cancer. The feedback signaling upon treatment of mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 was determined and the combinatorial activity of AZD8055 and HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 in cell signaling and proliferation were detected. Treatment of breast cancer T47D cells with AZD8055 induced activation of AKT and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which was accompanied with increase in expression of multiple upstream proteins including EGFR, HER2, HER3 and IRS-1. Different RTKs were revealed to be responsible for the reactivation of AKT by AZD8055 in different breast cancer cell lines. Down-regulation of these proteins differentially enhanced the antiproliferative activity of AZD8055. AZD8055 and AUY922 displayed synergistic effect against a panel of human breast cancer cells irrespective their genotype, which was associated with enhanced cell cycle arrest and inhibition of DNA synthesis. AUY922 destabilized multiple tested tyrosine kinases and abrogated activation of AKT induced by AZD8055. AZD8055 also inhibited up-regulation of HSP70 and HSP27 upon AUY922 treatment. Cotreatment of these two drugs demonstrated synergistic activity against triple negative MDA-MB-468 xenograft without enhanced toxicity. The combination of AZD8055 and AUY922 demonstrated synergistic activity against various types of breast cancer and established a mechanistic rationale for a combination approach using catalytic mTOR kinase inhibitor and HSP90 inhibitor in the treatment of breast cancer.
