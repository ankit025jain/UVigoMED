{"id":79487,"title":"Evaluation of amifostine for protection against cisplatin-induced serious hearing loss in children treated for average-risk or high-risk medulloblastoma.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate amifostine for protection from cisplatin-induced serious hearing loss in patients with average-risk medulloblastoma by extending a previous analysis to a much larger sample size. In addition, this study aimed to assess amifostine with serious hearing loss in patients with high-risk medulloblastoma treated with cisplatin.Newly diagnosed medulloblastoma patients (n = 379; ages 3-21 years), enrolled on one of 2 sequential St. Jude clinical protocols that included 4 courses of 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin, were compared for hearing loss by whether or not they received 600 mg/m(2) of amifostine immediately before and 3 hours into each cisplatin infusion. Amifostine administration was not randomized. The last audiological evaluation between 5.5 and 24.5 months following protocol treatment initiation was graded using the Chang Ototoxicity Scale. A grade of ? 2b (loss requiring a hearing aid or deafness) was considered a serious event.Among average-risk patients (n = 263), amifostine was associated with protection from serious hearing loss (adjusted OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14-0.64). For high-risk patients (n = 116), however, there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that amifostine prevented serious hearing loss (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.31-2.54).Although patients in this study were not randomly assigned to amifostine treatment, we found evidence in favor of amifostine administration for protection against cisplatin-induced serious hearing loss in average-risk but not in high-risk, medulloblastoma patients.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24414535","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.567742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.376714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.340249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Amifostine","weight":0.207478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amifostine"},{"name":"Ototoxicity","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ototoxicity"},{"name":"Clinical trial protocol","weight":0.108778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial_protocol"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medulloblastoma","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulloblastoma"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Audiology","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"379","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/379"},{"name":"263","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/263"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Initiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation"},{"name":"Jude the Apostle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_the_Apostle"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Mambai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambai"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
