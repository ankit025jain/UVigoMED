{"id":47064,"title":"[Correlations between tumor infiltrating Th17 cells and clinicopathological parameters in patients with colorectal cancer].","abstract":"To observe the correlations between the percentage of tumor infiltrating Th17 cells and clinicopathological parameters in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).Tumor and normal mucosal tissues were collected from 28 CRC patients. The proportions of Th17 cells in lymphocytes were detected by flow cytometry. The supernatant levels of IL-17A in cultured normal and tumor tissues were measured by ELISA. The correlations between the proportions of tumor infiltrating Th17 cells as well as the tumor supernatant levels of IL-17A and clinicopathological parameters in CRC patients were further analyzed.There was no significant difference in the expression of Th17 cells between normal tissues (2.24 ± 0.24)% and tumor tissues (2.47 ± 0.34)% (P>0.05). Compared with normal tissues, the supernatant levels of IL-17A in tumor tissues were significantly up-regulated [(257.74±31.36) pg/mL vs (163.53±12.62)pg/mL, P<0.05]. The proportions of tumor infiltrating Th17 cells and the tumor supernatant levels of IL-17A had no associations with age, gender, tumor location, tumor size and growth characteristics (P>0.05), but they were correlated with tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (P<0.05). No associations between the proportions of infiltrating Th17 cells as well as the supernatant levels of IL-17A in the normal tissues and all clinicopathological parameters were found (P>0.05).Th17 cells may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of the development of CRC.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606752","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.858148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.747474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.74432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.625748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.619298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.512295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.323648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.105252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.079334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.0111043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"}]}
