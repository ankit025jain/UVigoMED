{"id":82751,"title":"A multidisciplinary approach for the rehabilitation of a patient with an excessively worn dentition: a clinical report.","abstract":"This clinical report describes a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and treatment of a patient with a severely worn dentition. The treatment included osteotomy and immediate implant placement and loading in the mandible. The definitive restorations were implant- and tooth-supported metal ceramic restorations. These restorations were fabricated with metal occlusal surfaces at an increased occlusal vertical dimension, which provided acceptable esthetics and function.
