{"id":90590,"title":"Tissue engineering scaffolds of mesoporous magnesium silicate and poly(?-caprolactone)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(?-caprolactone) composite.","abstract":"Mesoporous magnesium silicate (m-MS) and poly(?-caprolactone)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL-PEG-PCL) composite scaffolds were fabricated by solvent-casting and particulate leaching method. The results suggested that the incorporation of m-MS into PCL-PEG-PCL could significantly improve the water adsorption of the m-MS/PCL-PEG-PCL composite (m-MPC) scaffolds. The in vitro degradation behavior of m-MPC scaffolds were determined by testing weight loss of the scaffolds after soaking into phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and the result showed that the degradation of m-MPC scaffolds was obviously enhanced by addition of m-MS into PCL-PEG-PCL after soaking for 10 weeks. Proliferation of MG63 cells on m-MPC was significantly higher than MPC scaffolds at 4 and 7 days. ALP activity on the m-MPC was obviously higher than MPC scaffolds at 7 days, revealing that m-MPC could promote cell differentiation. Histological evaluation showed that the introduction of m-MS into PCL-PEG-PCL enhanced the efficiency of new bone formation when the m-MPC scaffolds implanted into bone defect of rabbits. The results suggested that the inorganic/organic composite of m-MS and PCL-PEG-PCL scaffolds exhibited good biocompatibility, degradability and osteogenesis.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595904","annotations":[{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.839721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Biocompatibility","weight":0.734955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocompatibility"},{"name":"Tissue engineering","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_engineering"},{"name":"Adsorption","weight":0.691293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption"},{"name":"Silicate","weight":0.682611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicate"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.587575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.490485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Talc","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talc"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.466738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.358068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.269221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.259055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.159241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Buffer solution","weight":0.0772076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mesoporous material","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoporous_material"},{"name":"Public Broadcasting Service","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service"},{"name":"Salinity","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity"},{"name":"Leaching (chemistry)","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaching_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Scaffolding","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"},{"name":"Semiconductor device fabrication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"}]}
