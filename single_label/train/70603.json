{"id":70603,"title":"Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance neurography for parapharyngeal schwannomas: preoperative determination of the originating nerves.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) for determining the originating nerve of parapharyngeal schwannomas preoperatively.Six patients who underwent DW-MRN preoperatively for a parapharyngeal schwannoma were studied. Prediction of the originating nerve was performed. With the conventional method, a tumor showing \"separation\" between the internal jugular vein and carotid artery was determined to originate from the vagus nerve, with \"no separation\" from the sympathetic chain. With DW-MRN, the relationships between the vagus nerve and sympathetic chain to the tumor were characterized as \"connected\" or \"dislocated.\" A nerve connected to the tumor was determined as the origin.Surgeries revealed that the origins included 1 vagus nerve and 5 sympathetic chains. Using a conventional method, all 6 cases were diagnosed correctly, whereas DW-MRN successfully predicted only 4 cases with a sympathetic chain origin.The DW-MRN is a feasible approach for determining an originating nerve.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25170536","annotations":[{"name":"Internal jugular vein","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_jugular_vein"},{"name":"Vagus nerve","weight":0.837805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.733991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.728147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.69413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.619067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Sympathetic trunk","weight":0.443799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_trunk"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.411583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Motor Racing Network","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Racing_Network"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance neurography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_neurography"},{"name":"Schwannoma","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwannoma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Christopher Columbus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Chain (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_(unit)"},{"name":"Drum Workshop","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_Workshop"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
