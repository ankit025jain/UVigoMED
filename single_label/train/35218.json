{"id":35218,"title":"Intermediate-term results of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support following congenital heart surgery.","abstract":"Although there are considerable data regarding in-hospital results of congenital heart surgery (CHS) patients requiring postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, there is limited information on intermediate-term outcomes.A single-institution retrospective review of 25 consecutive postoperative CHS patients who required ECMO and survived to hospital discharge between January 2003 and June 2008. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.At a median follow-up of 3.3 years (interquartile range: 1.2-5.9 years), there was one death which occurred at six months postsurgery. Kaplan-Meier-estimated survival at three years was 95% (95% confidence interval: 90%-100%). Indications for ECMO included extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (48%), systemic hypoxia (4%), postoperative low-cardiac output syndrome (28%), and intraoperative failure to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass (20%). Following ECMO support, 65% of patients had unplanned cardiac reinterventions (three requiring operative interventions, six requiring percutaneous interventions, and four requiring both), and 47% of patients required unplanned hospitalizations. In all, 29% of patients developed neurological deficits and 12% of patients developed chronic respiratory failure. No patients developed renal failure. Overall, systemic ventricular (SV) function normalized in 83% of patients, whereas 17% of patients had persistent mild-to-moderate SV dysfunction.Intermediate-term patient survival of ECMO following CHS is encouraging. However, neurological impairment and unplanned cardiac reinterventions remain significant concerns. Further delineation of risk factors to improve patient outcomes is warranted.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668971","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","weight":0.83444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenation"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.767865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.729617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Respiratory failure","weight":0.724891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.695305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.650959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.605816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.464781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.392857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.269299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.185579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Systemic circulation","weight":0.104516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Indication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Gross domestic product","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"},{"name":"Weaning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
