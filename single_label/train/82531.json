{"id":82531,"title":"Long and short term management of implant-supported mandibular overdentures.","abstract":"Common problems with the long term clinical use of implant-supported mandibular overdentures (ISMDs) include fractures of dentures, bars and clips, and reactivation of clips. Many general dental practitioners (GDPs) are reticent to be involved in the maintenance of ISMDs, especially if they have not had any further training or are unfamiliar with implant components and systems. This article highlights the need for the training of GDPs in maintenance and management of ISMDs as an increasing number of edentulous patients are being provided with ISMDs, resulting in an increasing need for the maintenance of the prosthesis in the primary care setting at a possible cost to the patient.Implant-supported overdentures are becoming a common treatment option for edentulous patients, however, they are not without their clinical challenges, many of which can be easily rectified in a primary care environment, such as general practice.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597027","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.764874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.287499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.25084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Gross domestic product","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.125451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Common (entertainer)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_(entertainer)"},{"name":"Bar (establishment)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(establishment)"},{"name":"Rectification (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectification_(geometry)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Modesty","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modesty"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
