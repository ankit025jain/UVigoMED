{"id":25983,"title":"Effect of peripheral vascular disease on mortality in cardiac transplant recipients (from the United Network of Organ Sharing Database).","abstract":"Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) portends increased morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. In those with advanced heart failure, heart transplantation (HT) is the only causative therapy to increase survival. However, little is known about the impact of symptomatic PVD on survival of HT recipients in large multicenter cohorts. The aim of this study was to investigate an association between recipient symptomatic PVD and survival after HT. We analyzed 20,297 patients from the United Network of Organ Sharing data set. Survival analysis using a control cohort established by propensity matching was performed. There was an increased prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in 711 patients with symptomatic PVD compared with 19,586 patients without PVD. Patients with pretransplant symptomatic PVD had increased post-transplant mortality compared with those without PVD (1-, 5- and 10-year survival rate 91.5% vs 94.9%, 74.8% vs 82.6%, 48.6% vs 54.7%, respectively, log-rank p<0.001). On multivariate analysis based on the propensity matching, factors associated with a lower survival rate were presence of PVD (hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidential interval 1.02 to 1.42, p=0.030), and female gender (hazard ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.47, p=0.034). In conclusion, patients with symptomatic PVD have a lower survival rate after HT. Symptomatic PVD should be considered an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in patients undergoing HT evaluation.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Cardiovascular
