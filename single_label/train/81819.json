{"id":81819,"title":"Modified visor approach applied to total or subtotal glossectomy and reconstruction: avoidance of lip splitting and mandibulotomy and cutting off mental nerve.","abstract":"A lower lip-splitting incision has traditionally been performed with different types of mandibulotomy approaches for obtaining wide access to total or subtotal glossectomy. However, lip splitting can be associated with unfavorable aesthetic and function results. We describe our new modification of a traditional visor approach without lip splitting, mandibulotomy, and reserve mental nerve to avoid these morbidities and to compare aesthetic, functional, and patient subjective outcomes between the two access procedures.Of the patients undergoing total or subtotal glossectomy and reconstruction with flaps, 99 were grouped according to a surgical access procedure performed (lip split and mandibulotomy [LSM] or modified visor approach [MVA]). Data on surgical morbidity and outcomes were compared. All the tumors were safely removed by means of our modified visor approach through the combined intraoral and transcervical routes with adequate resection margins. There were no troublesome difficulties in reconstruction of the surgical defects with various flaps. Recurrence rates, swallowing, chewing, and speech were similar for both groups. Rates of postoperative fistulae were 9.3 % (LSM) vs 0 % (MVA). There were significant differences between the two groups in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) signs (p?=?0.000) and for appearance domains (p?=?0.01). Avoiding lip splitting and mandibulotomy reduces patient morbidity and hospital stay and gets excellent aesthetic consequences; reserve mental nerve can avoid lower lip numbness after surgery. In our experience, the lower lip-splitting and mandibulotomy procedure for surgical exposure is unnecessary for both oncologic resection and reconstruction of tongue cancers.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819171","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Paresthesia","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.604126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.593882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Glossectomy","weight":0.57818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossectomy"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.565566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.354078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.291534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.273383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.190254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.190117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.151096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Swallowing","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Mental nerve","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_nerve"},{"name":"Domain (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(biology)"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Visor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visor"},{"name":"Volt-ampere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt-ampere"},{"name":"Lower lip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_lip"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Rates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rates"},{"name":"Landing Ship Medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Ship_Medium"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
