{"id":89274,"title":"The outcome of modified extended trochanteric osteotomy in revision THA for Vancouver B2/B3 periprosthetic fractures of the femur.","abstract":"We hypothesised that a modified ETO in patients undergoing revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) for treatment of Vancouver B2/B3 peri-prosthetic fractures would be associated with good clinical outcomes. A retrospective review was conducted of 34 patients (mean age 73 years). At mean follow-up of 57 months, the ETO had healed in all patients. Two patients had subsidence of the femoral stem at two and three years postoperatively requiring revision, and one patient had a dislocation 3 months after surgery. The mean Harris Hip Score at the time of the final follow-up was 76.9 (range, 46-95); 23/34 patients had an excellent result, 7/34 a good result, and 4/34 a poor result. We conclude that satisfactory outcomes can be obtained using this technique.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736292","annotations":[{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.798359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.676455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.665051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.660086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.499321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.34962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.267469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Subsidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidence"},{"name":"Business-to-business","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business"},{"name":"Vancouver","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"734","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/734"},{"name":"24th century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24th_century_BC"},{"name":"Editing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing"},{"name":"European Theater of Operations United States Army","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Theater_of_Operations_United_States_Army"},{"name":"Second baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"}]}
