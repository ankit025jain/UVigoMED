{"id":53701,"title":"Study on erythrocyte aggregation using computerized image analysis methods.","abstract":"To study the relationship between erythrocyte aggregation and physical parameters: temperature and pH.Aggregation was evaluated using computerized image analysis by Aggregate Shape Parameter (ASP), defined as the ratio of the aggregate projected area to its square perimeter, and erythrocyte aggregation index (EAI). EAI was measured and compared at different temperatures (4 degreeC, 20 degreeC, 37 degreeC) and different pH values (3, 5, 7 and 9).The results show that the increase in temperature induces EAI increase and a decrease in Ph, a decrease of erythrocyte aggregation. It was found that, at pH=3 and 5, erythrocytes are destroyed and, at pH=9 RBC clusters are formed.RBC aggregate shape reflects intercellular interaction and its quantification may thus be another characteristic of RBC aggregation. Increased RBC aggregation was observed in various pathological states, such as diabetes and myocardial infarction, or following trauma.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502054","annotations":[{"name":"PH","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.665744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.642141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.501005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.419784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.355612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.13498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.133996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Shape","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape"},{"name":"Perimeter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter"},{"name":"Square (geometry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(geometry)"},{"name":"Image analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_analysis"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Active Server Pages","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages"},{"name":"Enterprise application integration","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_application_integration"},{"name":"Projected area","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projected_area"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"}]}
