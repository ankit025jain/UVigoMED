{"id":49919,"title":"Development of molecular targeted drugs for advanced thyroid cancer in Japan.","abstract":"Up until now there have been no promising drugs for the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer, but the development of novel therapeutic agents is now anticipated as a result of the advent of molecular targeted drugs that inhibit tumor growth signals or angiogenesis. Against a background in which the development of numerous molecular targeted drugs for advanced thyroid cancer is being pursued worldwide, the development of sorafenib, vandetanib, and lenvatinib is currently also under way in Japan. All three of these compounds are undergoing phase 3 trials or have been approved abroad, and because they are in the final stage of development in Japan, they are expected to be introduced in clinical settings in the near future. After they have been introduced, it will be necessary to understand the differences between these compounds and to administer them to patients appropriately.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24849385","annotations":[{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.608697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.593318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.575048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.461754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.449365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Sorafenib","weight":0.417124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorafenib"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.414275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Vandetanib","weight":0.381855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandetanib"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.287222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
