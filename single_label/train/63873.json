{"id":63873,"title":"Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the elderly complicated by the onset of acute myeloid leukemia.","abstract":"We herein describe the case of a 62-year-old woman who presented with anemia and an 8-month history of weight loss. Bone marrow aspiration showed increased myeloblasts. The histopathology findings of biopsy specimens of the right cervical lymph node and intestinal mass indicated B-lymphoproliferative disorder (B-LPD) with Hodgkin lymphoma-like morphologic features and polymorphous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), respectively. In addition, both types of lymphoma cells were positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNA-1. The patient was diagnosed with EBV-associated B-LPD and simultaneous acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This is the first case of a patient diagnosed with simultaneous EBV-positive DLBCL of the elderly and AML.
