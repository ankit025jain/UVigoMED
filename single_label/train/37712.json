{"id":37712,"title":"A novel ATP7B gene mutation in a liver failure patient with normal ceruloplasmin and low serum alkaline phosphatase.","abstract":"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare disorder of copper metabolism resulting in accumulation of copper in liver and other organs. We present a liver failure patient, who was misdiagnosed for two years, with normal ceruloplasmin and low serum alkaline phosphatase. Molecular testing revealed a novel p.Ala982Thr mutation within ATP7B gene. The pathology of liver sample showed a large amount of copper deposition in the hepatocytes and confirmed the diagnosis of WD. Our data highlighted the importance of molecular testing in the early diagnosis of atypical WD.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476933","annotations":[{"name":"Wilson's disease","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson's_disease"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.758721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Ceruloplasmin","weight":0.734825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceruloplasmin"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.710647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.699676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.632463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.578734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.541009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.392493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Threonine","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Wilson disease protein","weight":0.0586762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_disease_protein"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
