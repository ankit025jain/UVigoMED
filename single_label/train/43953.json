{"id":43953,"title":"[Effect of Actinidia chinensis planch polysaccharide on the growth and apoptosis, and p-p38 expression in human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells].","abstract":"To investigate the effect of Actinidia chinensis Planch polysaccharide (ACPS) on the growth and apoptosis of human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells, and to explore the effect of SGC-7901 cells on p-p38 expression.The inhibition rates at different concentrations of ACPS on SGC-7901 cells at 24, 48, and 72 h were detected using CCK-8 method. Apoptosis ratios in SGC-7901 were determined by flow cytometry after 48-h treatment of different concentrations of ACPS. The expression of pro-caspase-9, PARP, and p-p38 in SGC-7901 cells after treated by different concentrations of ACPS was detected using Western blot. The expression of pro-caspase-9, PARP, and p-p38 was detected after SGC-7901 cells were pre-treated by p38 specific inhibitor.Compared with the control group, the optical density of SGC-7901 cells decreased after treated by 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/mL ACPS (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the longer the acting time, the lower the optic density (P < 0.01). IC50 was 7.43 mg/mL at 24 h; 3.88 mg/mL at 48 h, and 1.32 mg/mL at 72 h respectively. ACPS suppressed the protein expression of pro-caspase-9 (P < 0.01) and up-regulated the expression of PARP (89KD) (both P < 0.01). Further study showed that the protein expression of p-p38 was up-regulated in SGC-7901 cells treated by ACPS of different concentrations at 24 h (P < 0.05). The expression of phosphorylation p38 and the ACPS induced apoptosis of SGC-7901 cells could be inhibited after treated by specific inhibitor for 2 h.ACPS could inhibit the growth of SGC-7901 cells and induce apoptosis. The underlying mechanism of inducing apoptosis was partially due to activating the p38MAPK path and further activating Caspase9 and PARP, finally leading to cell death.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758086","annotations":[{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.913129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.779665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.707167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.703719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.41817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.35184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.279746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.218501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.125893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.112555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Cholecystokinin","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystokinin"},{"name":"Absorbance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance"},{"name":"P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","weight":0.0203168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.018968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
