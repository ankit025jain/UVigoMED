{"id":4977,"title":"[Treatment of Seinsheimer type V subtrochanteric femoral fractures with inversive LISS plate combined with steel wire].","abstract":"To study clinical effects of inversive LISS (less invasive stabilization system, LISS) plate combined with steel wire for the treatment of Seinsheimer type V subtrochanteric femoral fractures. METHODS : From January 2009 to Janurary 2012, 11 patients with Seinsheimer type V subtrochanteric femoral fractures were treated with inversive LISS plate combined with steel wire, including 8 males and 3 females, ranging in age from 35 to 61 years old (averaged, 51 years old). Causes of injury: 8 patients caused by accident and 3 patients caused by falling down. According to X-ray examination, all the patients were type V subtrochanteric femoral fractures and were treated with LISS plate combined with steel wire. Merle d'Aubigne scores were used to evaluate therapeutic effects on hip.The mean period of follow-up was 16 months (ranged, 12 to 28 months). All the patients obtained bone union for average 3.8 months (ranged from 3 to 4.3 months). There were no complications such as deep infection,deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and bone nonunion. According to Merle d'Aubigne scores, 7 patients got an excellent result and 4 good.Inversive LISS plate combined with steel wire for the treatment of Seinsheimer type V subtrochanteric femoral fractures is satisfactory, Which can provide stable fixation for fracture end and provide an ideal internal fixation method for treatment of this kind of fractures in the future.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464600","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.786795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.569549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.512277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.445466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.176375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0504415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Steel","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Deep vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
