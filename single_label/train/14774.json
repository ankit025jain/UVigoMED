{"id":14774,"title":"Macrophages mediate a switch between canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways in canine mammary tumors.","abstract":"According to the current hypothesis, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are \"corrupted\" by cancer cells and subsequently facilitate, rather than inhibit, tumor metastasis. Because the molecular mechanisms of cancer cell-TAM interactions are complicated and controversial we aimed to better define this phenomenon.Using microRNA microarrays, Real-time qPCR and Western blot we showed that co-culture of canine mammary tumor cells with TAMs or treatment with macrophage-conditioned medium inhibited the canonical Wnt pathway and activated the non-canonical Wnt pathway in tumor cells. We also showed that co-culture of TAMs with tumor cells increased expression of canonical Wnt inhibitors in TAMs. Subsequently, we demonstrated macrophage-induced invasive growth patterns and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of tumor cells. Validation of these results in canine mammary carcinoma tissues (n?=?50) and xenograft tumors indicated the activation of non-canonical and canonical Wnt pathways in metastatic tumors and non-metastatic malignancies, respectively. Activation of non-canonical Wnt pathway correlated with number of TAMs.We demonstrated that TAMs mediate a \"switch\" between canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways in canine mammary tumors, leading to increased tumor invasion and metastasis. Interestingly, similar changes in neoplastic cells were observed in the presence of macrophage-conditioned medium or live macrophages. These observations indicate that rather than being \"corrupted\" by cancer cells, TAMs constitutively secrete canonical Wnt inhibitors that decrease tumor proliferation and development, but as a side effect, they induce the non-canonical Wnt pathway, which leads to tumor metastasis. These data challenge the conventional understanding of TAM-cancer cell interactions.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24404146","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.818951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Wnt signaling pathway","weight":0.797842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.614581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.601962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.536671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.450172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.372072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.340173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.152402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Secretory pathway","weight":0.036011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretory_pathway"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Mammary tumor","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_tumor"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"}]}
