{"id":80333,"title":"Interferon-mediated innate immune responses against malaria parasite liver stages.","abstract":"Mosquito-transmitted malaria parasites infect hepatocytes and asymptomatically replicate as liver stages. Using RNA sequencing, we show that a rodent malaria liver-stage infection stimulates a robust innate immune response including type I interferon (IFN) and IFN? pathways. Liver-stage infection is suppressed by these infection-engendered innate responses. This suppression was abrogated in mice deficient in IFN?, the type I IFN ?/? receptor (IFNAR), and interferon regulatory factor 3. Natural killer and CD49b(+)CD3(+) natural killer T (NKT) cells increased in the liver after a primary infection, and CD1d-restricted NKT cells, which secrete IFN?, were critical in reducing liver-stage burden of a secondary infection. Lack of IFNAR signaling abrogated the increase in NKT cell numbers in the liver, showing a link between type I IFN signaling, cell recruitment, and subsequent parasite elimination. Our findings demonstrate innate immune sensing of malaria parasite liver-stage infection and that the ensuing innate responses can eliminate the parasite.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703850","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Natural Killer T cell","weight":0.841951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Killer_T_cell"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.783482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.751881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.728732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Interferon type I","weight":0.594412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_I"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.492811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.439931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.42529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.313345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0625596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Secondary infection","weight":0.0540804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_infection"},{"name":"CD1","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD1"},{"name":"Interferon regulatory factors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_regulatory_factors"},{"name":"Interferon-alpha/beta receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon-alpha/beta_receptor"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0263704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"}]}
