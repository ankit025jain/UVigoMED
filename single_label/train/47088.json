{"id":47088,"title":"Excessive immunosuppression as a potential cause of poor survival in simultaneous liver/kidney transplantation for hepatitis C.","abstract":"Appropriate recipient selection of simultaneous liver/kidney transplantation (SLKT) remains controversial. In particular, data on liver graft survival in hepatitis C virus-infected (HCV+) SLKT recipients are lacking. We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of HCV+ SLKT recipients (N = 25) in comparison with HCV- SLKT (N = 26) and HCV+ liver transplantation alone (LTA, N = 296). Despite backgrounds of HCV+ and HCV- SLKT being similar, HCV+ SLKT demonstrated significantly impaired 5-year liver graft survival of 35% (HCV- SLKT, 79%, P = 0.004). Compared with HCV+ LTA, induction immunosuppression was more frequently used in HCV+ SLKT. Five-year liver graft survival rate for HCV+ SLKT was significantly lower than that for LTA (35% vs. 74%, respectively, P < 0.001). Adjusted hazard ratio of liver graft loss in HCV+ SLKT was 4.9 (95% confidence interval 2.0-12.1, P = 0.001). HCV+ SLKT recipients were more likely to succumb to recurrent HCV and sepsis compared with LTA (32% vs. 8.8%, P < 0.001 and 24% vs. 8.8%, P = 0.030, respectively). Ten HCV+ SLKT recipients underwent anti-HCV therapy for recurrent HCV; only 1 achieved sustained virological response. HCV+ SLKT is associated with significantly decreased long-term prognosis compared with HCV- SLKT and HCV+ LTA.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606223","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.789102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.711368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.701005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.592341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.479993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.153777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"}]}
