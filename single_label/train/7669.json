{"id":7669,"title":"Analysis of the genetic diversity of ovine herpesvirus 2 in samples from livestock with malignant catarrhal fever.","abstract":"In order to define better virus isolates from animals with malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), segments of three genes of ovine herpesvirus-2 were amplified from diagnostic samples representing MCF cases with a range of clinical presentations in cattle, including head and eye, alimentary and neurological. The variation within each gene segment was estimated by DNA sequencing, which confirmed that the newly-annotated Ov9.5 gene was significantly more polymorphic than either of the other loci tested (segments of ORF50 and ORF75), with alleles that differed at over 60% of nucleotide positions. Despite this, the nine Ov9.5 alleles characterised had identical predicted splicing patterns and could be translated into Ov9.5 polypeptides with at least 49% amino acid identity. This multi-locus approach has potential for use in epidemiological studies and in charactering chains of infection. However there was no association between specific variants of OvHV-2 and the clinical/pathological presentation of MCF in the cattle analysed.
