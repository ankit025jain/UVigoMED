{"id":47535,"title":"Therapeutic potential of morin against liver fibrosis in rats: modulation of oxidative stress, cytokine production and nuclear factor kappa B.","abstract":"Therapeutic potential of morin, a member of flavonoid family, against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis in rats was investigated and compared with that of silymarin. Results show that treatment with morin (30 mg/kg/day) revealed attenuation in liver index and serum biomarkers of liver function that were enhanced by chronic CCl4 intoxication. Further, morin inhibited the elevated levels of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide and restored hepatic reduced glutathione to its normal level. The increased production of hepatic hydroxyproline content by CCl4 was markedly decreased by administration of morin. In addition, treatment with morin significantly attenuated the inflammatory responses caused by CCl4 as evident by the decreased hepatic tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?) level, immunohistochemical expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase and nuclear factor kappa B. Collectively, this study indicates that morin possesses antifibrotic effect in the CCl4 model of fibrosis via reducing oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and fibrogenic markers.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583409","annotations":[{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.939184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Silibinin","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silibinin"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Carbon tetrachloride","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Hydroxyproline","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyproline"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.711665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.657284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.584048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.417779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.392248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.378008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Substance intoxication","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"}]}
