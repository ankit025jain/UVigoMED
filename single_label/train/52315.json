{"id":52315,"title":"Antinociceptive effect of chlorogenic acid in rats with painful diabetic neuropathy.","abstract":"The present study aimed to evaluate possible antinociceptive effects of chlorogenic acid in streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathic pain in rats. Chlorogenic acid (100 mg/kg) was administered daily for 14 days. Our study showed for the first time that both single and chronic chlorogenic acid treatments produced significant antinociceptive effects in diabetic rats. In contrast, single dose of chlorogenic acid showed no signs of an antinociceptive effect, but chronic treatment exerted antinociceptive potential in nondiabetic rats. Additionally, chronic treatment effectively reduced hyperglycemia that induced by diabetes. In conclusion, chlorogenic acid has beneficial effects for the management of diabetic neuropathic pain.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611441","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Diabetic neuropathy","weight":0.74838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.692815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"Neuropathic pain","weight":0.687362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathic_pain"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.43324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.344178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.196653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chlorogenic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorogenic_acid"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
