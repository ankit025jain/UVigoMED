{"id":11927,"title":"Sesquiterpene lactones from Mikania micrantha and Mikania cordifolia and their cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory evaluation.","abstract":"The guaianolide 8-epi-mikanokryptin (1) and the melampolide 11H?-11,13-dihydromicrantholide (2) along with known sesquiterpene lactones (3-13) and other constituents were isolated from the aerial parts of different populations of Mikania micrantha and Mikania cordifolia collected in several states of Mexico. The relative and absolute configurations of 1 were determined by X-ray diffraction and CD analysis, respectively. Considering the (1)H and (13)C NMR chemical shift similarities and the H-H coupling constant values, a [(1)D(14), (15)D5] conformation was established for micrantholides (2, 8-13). We tested nearly all the sesquiterpene lactones for antiproliferative activity in human cancer cell lines, and they exhibited moderate activity. Additionally, in a mouse ear model of edema induced by TPA, the anti-inflammatory activities were marginal.
