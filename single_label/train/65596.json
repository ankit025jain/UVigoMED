{"id":65596,"title":"High b value (2,000 s/mm2) diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer at 3 Tesla: comparison with 1,000 s/mm2 for tumor conspicuity and discrimination of aggressiveness.","abstract":"The objective of our study was to investigate tumor conspicuity and the discrimination potential for tumor aggressiveness on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) with high b value at 3-T.The institutional review board approved this study and waived the requirement for informed consent. A total of 50 patients with prostate cancer (69 cancer foci; 48 in the PZ, 20 in the TZ, and one in whole prostate) who underwent multiparametric prostate MRI including DW-MRI (b values: 0, 1000 s/mm2 and 0, 2000 s/mm2) on a 3-T system were included. Lesion conspicuity score (LCS) using visual assessment (1?=?invisible for surrounding normal site; 2?=?slightly high intensity; 3?=?moderately high; and 4?=?very high) and tumor-normal signal intensity ratio (TNR) were assessed, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC, Ã—10-3 mm2/s) of the tumor regions and normal regions were measured.Mean LCS and TNR at 0, 2000 s/mm2 was significantly higher than those at 0, 1000 s/mm2 (p<0.001 for both). In addition, ADC at both 0, 1000 and 0, 2000 s/mm2 was found to distinguish intermediate or high risk cancer with Gleason score ?7 from low risk cancer with Gleason score ?6 (p<0.001 for both). Furthermore, ADC of tumor regions correlated with Gleason score at both 0, 1000 s/mm2 (??=?-0.602; p<0.001) and 0, 2000 s/mm2 (??=?-0.645; p<0.001).For tumor conspicuity and characterization of prostate cancer on DW-MRI of 3-T MRI, b?=?0, 2000 s/mm2 is more useful than b?=?0, 1000 s/mm2.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Male Urogenital
