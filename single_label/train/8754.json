{"id":8754,"title":"The effect of New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) on average daily gain and mortality in 4 Danish pig herds.","abstract":"The study evaluated the effect of New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) on average daily gain (ADG) and mortality and described the clinical manifestations in four herds suffering from the syndrome. NNPDS is a diarrhoeic syndrome affecting piglets within the first week of life, which is not caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) type A/C, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), rotavirus A, coronavirus, Cystoisospora suis, Strongyloides ransomi, Giardia spp or Cryptosporidium spp.Piglets were estimated to have a negative ADG of 9 and 14 g when diarrhoeic for 1 day and >1 day respectively. However, if only diarrhoeic on the day of birth, no negative effect on ADG was seen. Piglets originating from severely affected litters were estimated to have a reduced ADG of 38 g. The study did not show an overall effect of diarrhoea on mortality, but herd of origin, sow parity, birth weight, and gender were significantly associated with mortality. In one of the herds, approximately 25% of the diarrhoeic piglets vs. 6% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets died, and 74% of necropsied piglets were diagnosed with enteritis. These findings indicate that the high mortality seen in this herd was due to diarrhoea.NNPDS negatively affected ADG in piglets, and even piglets that were diarrhoeic for one day only experienced a reduction in ADG. However, the study showed that diarrhoea restricted to the day of birth did not affect ADG and suggested this phenomenon to be unrelated to the syndrome. Since the diarrhoeal status of the litter had important effects on ADG, future research on NNPDS probably ought to focus on piglets from severely affected litters.The study showed important dissimilarities in the course of diarrhoea between the herds, and one herd was considerably more affected than the others. Within this herd, NNPDS seemed to be associated with a higher mortality, whereas in general the study did not show lethal effects of NNPDS.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755093","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Cryptosporidiosis","weight":0.822248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptosporidiosis"},{"name":"Rotavirus","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.747034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Clostridium perfringens","weight":0.723129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_perfringens"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.608604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.588483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Giardia","weight":0.588142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giardia"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.461139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Enterotoxin","weight":0.356854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterotoxin"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.250769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterotoxigenic_Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.179976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Enteritis","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteritis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.13476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Coronavirus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Litter (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_(animal)"},{"name":"Strongyloides stercoralis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongyloides_stercoralis"}]}
