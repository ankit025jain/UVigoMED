{"id":14931,"title":"Influence of in-house composting of reused litter on litter quality, ammonia volatilisation and incidence of broiler foot pad dermatitis.","abstract":"1. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the residual effects of two windrow composting methods for reused litter on its quality (pH, moisture, ammonia), ammonia (NH3) volatilisation and the prevalence (scores 0-4) of foot pad dermatitis (FPD) and hock burn (HB) on d 1, 7, 14 and 21 of age in broilers. Litter was allowed to compost for 8 d within a 14-d interval between flocks. 2. The composting methods studied were with or without a PVC plastic sheet. The same procedures were applied for three consecutive flocks, with litter initially having been used for 12 flocks. Data were analysed with a mixed model of repeated measures of day, with main effects and interactions of day, composting method, litter age (block) and house nested within method. 3. At d 1, litter NH3 and NH3 volatilisation were higher in the covered litter method. Litter moisture increased to 45.3% as broilers aged. The incidence of FPD also increased with age. No signs of HB were found in any bird throughout the trials. 4. There was no effect of litter composting methods on the prevalence of FPD or body weight at any age. 5. Litter moisture should be controlled to avoid NH3 volatilisation reaching critical levels. Windrow composting of litter with a PVC plastic sheet may not be required when considering the broiler housing environment.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397504","annotations":[{"name":"Ammonia","weight":0.842449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Compost","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost"},{"name":"Polyvinyl chloride","weight":0.543602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Windrow composting","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windrow_composting"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Moisture","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisture"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.110833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Volatilisation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatilisation"},{"name":"Grilling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grilling"},{"name":"Windrow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windrow"},{"name":"Mixed model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model"},{"name":"Hock (anatomy)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hock_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Litter","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"New Hampshire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Broiler","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broiler"},{"name":"Concrete masonry unit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_masonry_unit"},{"name":"Repeated measures design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Recycling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling"},{"name":"National Highway 3 (India)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_3_(India)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"List of Kamen Rider W characters","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kamen_Rider_W_characters"},{"name":"House","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"}]}
