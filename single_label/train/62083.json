{"id":62083,"title":"Case for diagnosis. Cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease.","abstract":"Cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare, lymphoproliferative disease. It is benign and self-limited, only involves skin and subcutaneous tissue and typically occurs as histiocyte-rich inflammatory infiltrates, manifesting as erythematous to brown papules, plaques, or nodules, without predilection for site. The authors describe a case of cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease in a 72-year-old man who presented erythematous and scaled plaque on the right neck for three months without systemic symptoms. Owing to local involvement, the patient received a surgery to exsect the lesion completely and remained asymptomatic with no signs of recurrence at the 9-month follow up.
