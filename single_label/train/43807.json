{"id":43807,"title":"Ileocolic intussusception due to lipomatosis of the ileum: a common complication of a rare clinical entity.","abstract":"We report a case of intestinal ileal lipomatosis in a 56-year-old Caucasian male complicated with small bowel obstruction due to ileocolic intussusception with a lipoma serving as lead point. This rare disease is often only discovered incidentally as a consequence of mechanical complications and not well reported in the international literature, compared to intussusception due to an isolated lipoma. Computed tomography is the imaging modality of choice to depict complications of this distinct clinicopathological entity. Density measurements can confirm the fatty content and homogeneity analysis of the lesions can guide the radiologist in the differential diagnosis.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24765771","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.795347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.773685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Lipoma","weight":0.707304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoma"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.65757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.533736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.473639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.358783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.2563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Intussusception (medical disorder)","weight":0.0998947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intussusception_(medical_disorder)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Lipomatosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipomatosis"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Ileocolic artery","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileocolic_artery"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
