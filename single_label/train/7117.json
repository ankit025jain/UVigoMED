{"id":7117,"title":"Cutting edge: Dexamethasone potentiates the responses of both regulatory T cells and B-1 cells to antigen immunization in the ApoE(-/-) mouse model of atherosclerosis.","abstract":"The immunosuppressant dexamethasone was shown to preferentially deplete CD4+ effector T cells while sparing regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vivo. In the current study, we show that it also preferentially depletes B-2 cells while sparing B-1 cells. In the ApoE(-/-) mouse model of atherosclerosis, in which both Tregs and B-1 cells are thought to play an atheroprotective role, we show that HSP60-targeted immunization in the presence of dexamethasone raises Ag-reactive Tregs and B-1 cells concomitantly and reduces the severity of atherosclerosis. These results indicate that dexamethasone is an adjuvant that potentiates both the Treg and B-1 responses to immunogens. This study shows that B-1 cells with a specificity for a disease-relevant Ag can be raised in vivo by immunization.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24899497","annotations":[{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.89825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.892817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.815278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Immunosuppressant","weight":0.802289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressant"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.743732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.622752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.547471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.477028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.36926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein E","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"HSP60","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSP60"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Silver","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver"}]}
