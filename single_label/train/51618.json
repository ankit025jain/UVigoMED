{"id":51618,"title":"Cytotoxic reaction mediators: granzymes A and B in women with ovarian cancer.","abstract":"The purpose of this work was the assessment of cytotoxic reaction mediators - granzymes A and B in the serum of women with ovarian tumors. The study included 120 women with proven ovarian tumors. The control group consisted of 60 healthy women in whom no pathological changes within the reproductive system were detected. Concentrations of granzymes A and B were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay. The highest concentrations of the studied parameters were observed in serum of women with ovarian cancer. Moreover, the concentrations of granzymes A and B in patients with ovarian cancer were substantially increased in comparison to concentrations in patients with ovarian cystadenomas (P?<?0.0001) or ovarian teratomas (P?<?0.0001).","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673566","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.745269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Reproductive system","weight":0.726178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_system"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.709945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.5964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.466214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.148965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Granzyme","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granzyme"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"}]}
