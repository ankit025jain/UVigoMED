{"id":39679,"title":"[Contact lithotripsy in treatment of choledocholithiasis].","abstract":"It was suggested to use contact ultrasonic lithotripsy in lumen of common bile duct during laparoscopic surgery in order to preserve the sphincter apparatus of major duodenal papilla. Waveguide with original structure was used for lithotripsy performing. Waveguide's total length is 400 mm. It has a radially curved 40 degrees broken part with diameter of 6 mm cone rolling in working portion with diameter of 4 mm and length of 60 mm for introduction in common bile duct. There is concave lens on waveguide working portion end with diameter of 1 mm. A lens permits concentrating the waves beam in longitudinal direction avoiding its scattering and minimizing the impact on surrounding tissues. Lithotripsy efficiency was proved in the in vitro (n=68) and in vivo (n=20) experiments. Such structure of waveguide permits to penetrate in lumen of common bile duct through dilated cystic duct or choledochendysis for calculi fragmentation.
