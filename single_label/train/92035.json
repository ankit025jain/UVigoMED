{"id":92035,"title":"Preliminary efficacy of an attention and memory intervention post-childhood brain injury.","abstract":"Impairments in attention and memory are common consequences following paediatric acquired brain injury (ABI). Despite this, there is a scarcity of evidence-based interventions for these difficulties. The current study aimed to pilot the feasibility and efficacy of the English version of the Amsterdam Memory and Attention Test for Children (Amat-c) and to identify ecologically valid measures sensitive to post-evaluation improvements. It was expected that children with attention and memory difficulties post-TBI would show improved performance post-intervention on traditional cognitive measures and on measures of everyday performance.Three children (case study design) with an acquired brain injury (near drowning, birth delivery complications, fall from a horse) and currently between the ages of 8-13 were identified through audits of presentations to a metropolitan paediatric hospital. Each child underwent screening, pre-intervention and post-intervention assessments (immediate and 6 months).Results indicated improved performance in the areas of attention and memory from pre- to post-intervention, with gains maintained at 6 months post-intervention.Findings demonstrate initial support for efficacy of the Amat-c and its use with survivors of child ABI to alleviate common cognitive and functional consequences. A larger study is needed to further confirm these findings.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456062","annotations":[{"name":"Brain","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.480921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Amsterdam","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.397409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Drowning","weight":0.316152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.311544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.304167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.236233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.122601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Horse","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"813","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/813"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"List of horse accidents","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_horse_accidents"},{"name":"Ecological validity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_validity"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Children's hospital","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_hospital"},{"name":"Application binary interface","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface"},{"name":"Metropolitan area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area"},{"name":"Scarcity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity"}]}
