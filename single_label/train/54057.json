{"id":54057,"title":"Are zinc transporter type 8 antibodies a marker of autoimmune thyroiditis in non-obese adults with new-onset diabetes?","abstract":"The diagnosis of autoimmune diabetes in non-obese adults is based on the detection of glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA), islet cell antibodies (ICA) and antibodies to tyrosine phosphatase (IA-2A). Zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) has been identified as a new autoantigen in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The coincidence of autoimmune thyroiditis (AITD) with diabetes is common; therefore, screening of TSH and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (ATPO) is recommended during the diagnosis of diabetes. In this study, we determined whether the occurrence of islet autoantibodies is associated with a positive titre of ATPO in newly diagnosed adult-onset autoimmune diabetic patients.THE STUDY INVOLVED 80 NON-OBESE ADULTS AGED 44 (INTERQUARTILE RANGE (IQR): 37-51) years with a BMI of 24.0 (IQR: 22.2-26.0) kg/m(2) and new-onset diabetes. The markers of autoimmune diabetes (GADA, ICA, IA-2A and ZnT8A), TSH and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (ATPO) were evaluated.IN THE STUDY POPULATION, 70% (N=56) OF THE SUBJECTS WERE POSITIVE FOR AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOUR ASSESSED MARKERS OF AUTOIMMUNE DIABETES (83.9% GADA, 62.5% ICA, 42.8% IA-2A AND 33% ZNT8A) AND 37.5% OF THE SUBJECTS WERE POSITIVE FOR ATPO. THE ZNT8A-POSITIVE SUBJECTS HAD HIGHER ATPO TITRES THAN THE ZNT8A-NEGATIVE SUBJECTS (172.7 (IQR: 0.36-410.4) vs 92.4 (IQR: 0-23.7) IU/ml, P=0.001). Based on the assessed islet autoantibodies, the occurrence of positive ZnT8A and GADA was found to be related to a positive titre of ATPO using logistic regression (OR=5.48, 95% CI: 1.65-18.14, P=0.006 and OR=3.42, 95% CI: 1.09-10.71, P=0.03 respectively).In non-obese adults with new-onset diabetes, the presence of GADA and especially ZnT8 autoantibodies increases the risk of AITD.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480135","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroid peroxidase","weight":0.895948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_peroxidase"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.84024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.778082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Glutamate decarboxylase","weight":0.76913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_decarboxylase"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.748916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.744717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Thyroiditis","weight":0.632987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroiditis"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.559376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Autoimmune thyroiditis","weight":0.358136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_thyroiditis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.179976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Protein tyrosine phosphatase","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_tyrosine_phosphatase"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Ataxia telangiectasia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia_telangiectasia"},{"name":"Indiana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Carboxy-lyases","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxy-lyases"}]}
