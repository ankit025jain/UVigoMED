{"id":71248,"title":"Current status and future directions of molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapies for melanoma.","abstract":"Key molecular and immunological insights over the past decade have radically changed the face of therapy in melanoma. Whereas 5 years ago, treatment for advanced melanoma was restricted to the alkylating agent dacarbazine and the immunostimulants interleukin-2 and interferon-?-2b, today the therapeutic menu includes precise therapies that target key determinants in oncogenic pathways and immune checkpoints. In this chapter, we will review the current status and future directions of targeted therapies for melanoma directed at mitogen-activated pathways and immune checkpoints.
