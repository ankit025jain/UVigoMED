{"id":33537,"title":"[From tic disorders to Tourette syndrome: current data, comorbidities, and therapeutic approach in children].","abstract":"Motor tics are frequently observed in children during development. Usually transient and benign, they can become chronic over time, join various morbid disorders (vocal tics, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorders) and move toward genuine Tourette syndrome. In this case, it will be necessary to prevent impacts - mainly in terms of quality of life and emotional and relational problems - using a global therapeutic strategy combining psychoeducational approaches with appropriate medication.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815597","annotations":[{"name":"Tourette syndrome","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourette_syndrome"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tic","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.464546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.420291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"ADHD predominantly inattentive","weight":0.333724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD_predominantly_inattentive"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.0855396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Tic disorder","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic_disorder"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"},{"name":"Psychoeducational","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoeducational"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"}]}
