{"id":45168,"title":"Functional analysis of miR-101-3p and Rap1b involved in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis.","abstract":"MicroRNA-101(miR-101) has been shown to be down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major risk factor in the development and progression of HCC. However, the correlation between HBV and miR-101 has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we reported that HBV could repress miR-101-3p by inhibiting its promoter activity and identified the potential effects of miR-101-3p on some important biological properties of HCC cells by targeting Rap1b. Dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that HBV down-regulated miR-101-3p by inhibiting its promoter activity. Down-regulation of miR-101-3p promoted cell proliferation, migration, and reduced apoptosis, and resulted in up-regulation of Rap1b, while overexpression of miR-101-3p inhibited these processes. Moreover, overexpression of Rap1b was able to reverse the suppressed cell proliferation and migration mediated by miR-101-3p. Our data showed that HBV down-regulated miR-101-3p expression by inhibiting its promoter activity, which resulted in up-regulation of Rap1b, and down-regulation of miR-101-3p or up-regulation of Rap1b promoted proliferation and migration of HCC cells. This provides a new understanding of the mechanism of HBV-related HCC pathogenesis and the potential application of miR-101-3p in cancer therapy.
