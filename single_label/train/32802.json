{"id":32802,"title":"Anesthetic management of Costello syndrome: a case report.","abstract":"Costello syndrome is a rare genetic disorder with an estimated 300 medical cases worldwide. Typical features that characterize this syndrome include short stature, macrocephaly, developmental delay, loose skin folds, distinctive coarse facial features, and multiorgan system anomalies. The following case report discusses the anesthetic management for a 3-year-old boy undergoing general anesthesia for a scheduled dental restoration, hydrocelectomy, inguinal hernia repair, and bilateral myringotomy with placement of pressure equalization tubes. A scarcity of literature for the anesthetic management of Costello syndrome (also known as faciocutaneoskeletal syndrome) exists. Utilizing an overview of the pertinent literature, clinical practice recommendations are suggested for the anesthetic implications of managing a pediatric patient with this rare syndrome.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902452","annotations":[{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.769822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.736259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Developmental disability","weight":0.720775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.629062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Macrocephaly","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrocephaly"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.435257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Myringotomy","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myringotomy"},{"name":"Inguinal hernia","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_hernia"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.361956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.148691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Short stature","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_stature"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.067811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0177991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Skin fold","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_fold"}]}
