{"id":82007,"title":"Dento-skeletal effects of mixed palatal expansion evaluated by postero-anterior cephalometric analysis.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the dento-skeletal effects of mixed palatal expansion (MPE) on growing patients with a uni- or bilateral posterior crossbite and mild-to-moderate crowding as compared to untreated growing individuals using postero- anterior (PA) cephalometric analysis.A group of 24 patients (18 girls and 6 boys) treated with a Hyrax- type device was compared to an untreated matched control group at T0 (8.6 yrs ± 2.01) and T1 (10 yrs ± 2.00) using PA cephalograms. The cephalometric analysis included eight bilateral skeletal and dental landmarks. The groups were compared using independent sample t-test to estimate dento-skeletal effects on PA cephalograms.The treated group showed significant changes for the maxillary width (P<0.001) and upper molar width (P<0.001) when compared to those of the control group.MPE may effectively increase transverse dimensions and correct posterior crossbites.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745595","annotations":[{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.6648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.599935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.399442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.201457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.0300231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Cephalometric analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometric_analysis"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.0279886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Transverse plane","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_plane"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Kolmogorov space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_space"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"HP Multi-Programming Executive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Multi-Programming_Executive"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Cephalometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometry"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Hyrax","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrax"},{"name":"Landmark","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark"}]}
