{"id":45243,"title":"Clinical results of preoperative CDDP/5-FU chemotherapy followed by surgery for patients with clinical stage II/III thoracic esophageal cancer.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to clarify the outcomes of preoperative CDDP/5-FU chemotherapy (FP therapy) followed by surgery for patients with clinical Stage II/III thoracic esophageal cancer.Seventeen patients with clinical Stage II/III thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent FP therapy followed by esophagectomy were investigated with regard to the perioperative clinical results and postoperative outcomes.Grade 3 or 4 adverse effects associated with FP therapy were recognized in 2 of the 17 (11.8%) cases, and 16 patients completed 2 cycles of FP therapy (94.1%). Complications after surgery occurred in 7 cases (41.2%). There were 7 patients with postoperative recurrences (41.2%), 6 of whom had clinical Stage III disease. Similarly, 4 out of the 5 patients who died of cancer had clinical Stage III disease. All recurrences and cancer-related deaths were recognized in histological effectiveness of Grade 0/1 cases.Preoperative FP therapy was found to be safe for patients with clinical Stage II/III thoracic esophageal cancer. However, the treatment seemed to be less beneficial for Stage III patients than for Stage II patients, thus suggesting that a more powerful preoperative treatment may be necessary for clinical Stage III patients.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693680","annotations":[{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.479877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.467122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Esophagectomy","weight":0.428186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagectomy"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.331047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Professional wrestling throws","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_throws"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Graded stakes race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race"},{"name":"Saturn V","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V"}]}
