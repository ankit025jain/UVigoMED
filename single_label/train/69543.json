{"id":69543,"title":"[Erectile dysfunction and obesity].","abstract":"The review considers the relationship between obesity and erectile dysfunction (ED). Obesity is associated with the high prevalence of ED; however, the pathophysiological link between these conditions has yet to be adequately investigated. Visceral obesity leads to the enhanced activity of inflammatory responses and, thus, endothelial dysfunction and decreased plasma testosterone levels, which favors the development of hypogonadism and increases the risk of vascular diseases. Endothelial dysfunction and androgen deficiency in turn give rise to ED.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437225","annotations":[{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.856556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.832852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.642497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.590721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.388159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Endothelial dysfunction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelial_dysfunction"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"}]}
