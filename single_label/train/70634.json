{"id":70634,"title":"[Possibility of the natural product extracted from Calophyllum Brasiliense].","abstract":"During our search for cancer chemopreventing compounds derived from plant sources, we discovered that the natural product GUT-70, isolated from the stem bark of Calophyllum Brasiliense collected in Brazil, significantly inhibited the growth of leukemic cells via the induction of caspase-mediated and p53-independent apoptosis. Furthermore, we synthesized BNS-22 as a derivative of GUT-70, which showed more antiproliferative activity against human cancer cells than GUT-70. GUT-70 and BNS-22 commonly inhibited ubiquilin-1, suggesting that a GUT-70 derivative might become a First in Class agent. In addition, GUT-70 and BNS-22 inhibited HSP90 and topoisomerase II, respectively. Recently, we also found that GUT-70 inhibited HIV replication. These findings indicated that GUT-70 could serve as a lead compound to develop novel therapeutic agents against cancer and HIV-1 infection.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163331","annotations":[{"name":"Hsp90","weight":0.922164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsp90"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.853353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.803683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.735753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Topoisomerase","weight":0.72699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topoisomerase"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.722715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Type II topoisomerase","weight":0.711757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_topoisomerase"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.642546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.327906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Bark","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Lead compound","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_compound"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"}]}
