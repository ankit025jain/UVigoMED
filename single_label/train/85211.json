{"id":85211,"title":"[Experience of application of modern means of disinfection of air for preventive medications for respiratory diseases in troops].","abstract":"Among factors of acute respiratory diseases morbidity in military personnel one of most important is frequent interfuisions, of military personnel and long-term occupancy in barracks in conditions of overcrowding. These factors conduce accumulation and communication of causative agents. Prophylaxis focused on prevention ofaerogenous transmission of infection. It is very important if ventilation in barracks is ineffective. Principally new possibilities of air sanitation in barracks are aerosol generators. Application of these generators unlike standard disinfection method provides massive exposure of fine aerosol to rooms. Authors highlight successful experience ofaerosol generators type Raster ULV that helped to reduce acute respiratory diseases morbidity in military personnel.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25046931","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.712667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.644358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Aerosol","weight":0.577663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.575271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.516807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.470166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.349269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.314337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.154507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Overpopulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overpopulation"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Electric generator","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Raster graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Barracks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barracks"},{"name":"Occupancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupancy"},{"name":"Ultra-low-voltage processor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-low-voltage_processor"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Soldier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"}]}
