{"id":73339,"title":"Clinical application of adoptive T cell therapy in solid tumors.","abstract":"As an emerging therapeutic approach, adoptive T cell therapy shown promise in advanced solid malignancies. The results obtained in patients with metastatic melanoma and kidney cancer are encouraging because of the visible clinical benefits and limited adverse effects. Recently, the genetically-modified T cells expressing specific T cell receptors or chimeric antigen receptors are just now entering the clinical arena and show great potential for high avidity to tumor-associated antigens and long-lasting anti-tumor responses. However, continued investigations are necessary to improve the cell product quality so as to decrease adverse effects and clinical costs, and make adoptive T cell therapy a tool of choice for solid malignancies.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24912947","annotations":[{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.862887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.834977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.816036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.673624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cell therapy","weight":0.0429084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Avidity","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidity"}]}
