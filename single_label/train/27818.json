{"id":27818,"title":"Carbon monoxide poisoning in a Nigerian home: case reports.","abstract":"Casualties following inhalation of carbon monoxide in fumes produced/rom incomplete oxidation of hydrocarbon in gasoline-powered engines such as generator is common especially in developing countries. These are two case reports managed at University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH)and their outcomes.The first patient was a 17 year old female with 12 hour history of breathlessness, restlessness and unconsciousness following inhalation of fumes produced by an electric generator that was put in a confined area. She also presented with convulsion, sphincteric incontinence and foaming in the mouth.Pulse oximetery showed desaturation. She was placed on mechanical ventilation,mannitol, phenytoin infusion and intravenous vitamin C. She was weaned off the ventilator on the fourth day in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and discharged from ICU on the 6th day.The second patient was a 78 year old man with 18 hour history of unconsciousness and breathlessness following carbon monoxide poisoning. Pulse oximetry showed desaturation. He was placed on mechanical ventilation but died one hour and 30 minutes later probably due to advanced age and delayed presentation at the hospital.The cases reported highlight the risk of prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide and protracted delay in instituting oxygen therapy. Early referral of victims of carbon monoxide poisoning to a hospital with adequate intensive care facilities may improve survival. There should be regular public education on safe use of electric generating sets.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced
