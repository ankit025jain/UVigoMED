{"id":77525,"title":"[The economics of preventing psycho-social risks].","abstract":"The aim of the essay is to show the SHIELD methodology for helping the firm management to improve the risks prevention policy. It has been tested in the field with positive results. SHIELD is a cost-benefit analysis application to compare prevention and non-prevention costs, which arise from non-market risks. In the economic perspective safety risks (which include psycho-social risks) are non-market ones as they cause injures to workers during the job. SHIELD (Social Health Indicators for Economic Labour Decisions), is the original method proposed by the author. It is a cost benefits analysis application, which compares safety prevention and non-prevention costs. The comparison allow stop management to evaluate the efficiency of the current safety prevention policy as it helps top management to answer to the policy question: how much to invest in prevention costs? The costs comparison is obtained through the reclassification of safety costs between prevention and non-prevention costs (which are composed by claim damages and penalty sanction costs).SHIELD has been tested empirically in four companies operating in the agribusiness sector during a research financed by the Assessorato all'Agricoltura and INAI Regionale of Emilia Romagna Region. Results are postive: it has been found that the increase of prevention costs causes the cut of non-prevention costs in all companies looked into, as assumed by the high reliability organization theory. SHIELD can be applied to all companies which must have an accounting system by law, no matter of the industry they act. Its application has limited costs as SHIELD doesn't need changes in the accounting system. Safety costs sustained by the company are simply reclassified in prevention and non-prevention costs. The comparison of these two costs categories has been appreciated by top management of companies investigated as a useful support to decide the risks prevention policy for the company. The SHIELD original feature compared with others cost benefit analysis application is to compute registered costs in the company accounting system.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24665628","annotations":[{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Organizational studies","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_studies"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.729716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.721754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.560158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.535535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Investment","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.481939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.428122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Labour Party (UK)","weight":0.421179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)"},{"name":"Agribusiness","weight":0.417485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agribusiness"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.326731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.228493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Social psychology","weight":0.20868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology"},{"name":"Essay","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Sanctions (law)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_(law)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Perspective (cognitive)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)"},{"name":"Sentence (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
