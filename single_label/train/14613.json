{"id":14613,"title":"Prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. in asymptomatic food workers.","abstract":"Cryptosporidium spp. is obligatory intracellular parasite and causes intestinal infection. In intestine infections in the form of sporadic and epidemics, food and accordingly workers in food sector may play a role as the source of infection. In this study, it is aimed to reveal the existence of asymptomatic cryptosporidiosis.In the study, stool samples of 393 workers -employed at various branches of food sector in the region of Van- are used. In order to detect Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts, Modified Ziehl Neelsen (MZN) Staining was used.In this study, asymptomatic cryptosporidiosis has been detected in 5 (1.27%) of 393 workers.Epidemiological findings indicate that food workers can be source of cryptosporidiosis outbreak. Thus, searching for the existence of asymptomatic cryptosporidiosis food workers -which epidemiologically has potential significance- and taking the required measures in case of its determination are significant in respect of public health.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412862","annotations":[{"name":"Cryptosporidiosis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptosporidiosis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.738002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.727772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.713328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Apicomplexa lifecycle stages","weight":0.457728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Intracellular parasite","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular_parasite"},{"name":"Intestinal parasite","weight":0.0224886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_parasite"},{"name":"393","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/393"},{"name":"Van, Turkey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van,_Turkey"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Scott Ziehl","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Ziehl"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Play (activity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)"}]}
