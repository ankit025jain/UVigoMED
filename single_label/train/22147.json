{"id":22147,"title":"Role of IL-23 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis: a novel potential therapeutic target?","abstract":"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder determined by the activation of several immune cells and resident tissue cells. Various cytokines mediate inflammatory signals, including IL-23, which is an important factor involved in the differentiation of T helper (Th17) cells.Increasing evidence suggests that IL-23 is a central cytokine to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. An overview on both experimental and human data will be reported in order to support the hypothesis of a key pathogenic role of IL-23/Th17 axis.Targeting IL-23 might be a more selective, valid and effective therapeutic approach, which, potentially, may show important advantages in terms of long-term efficacy and safety in the treatment of psoriasis.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568095","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.320291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.307256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.201148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.111259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
