{"id":89430,"title":"Lean business model and implementation of a geriatric fracture center.","abstract":"Geriatric hip fracture is a common event associated with high costs of care and often with suboptimal outcomes for the patients. Ideally, a new care model to manage geriatric hip fractures would address both quality and safety of patient care as well as the need for reduced costs of care. The geriatric fracture center model of care is one such model reported to improve both outcomes and quality of care. It is a lean business model applied to medicine. This article describes basic lean business concepts applied to geriatric fracture care and information needed to successfully implement a geriatric fracture center. It is written to assist physicians and surgeons in their efforts to implement an improved care model for their patients.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721360","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.584805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.56626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.399514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.302906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Business","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.149145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.103777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.053154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Business model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model"},{"name":"Lean manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
