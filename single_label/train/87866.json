{"id":87866,"title":"[Acutrak headless compression screw fixation for the treatment of scaphoid non-union].","abstract":"To evaluate the early clinical and radiographic outcome of scaphoid non-unions treated with Acutrak headless compression screw.From January 2008 to July 2011,21 patients with scaphoid non-union were treated in our department. There were 18 males and 3 females with a mean age of (23.6 +/- 4.6) years; 12 cases were on right hand and 9 were on left. According to Herbert-Fisher classification, there were 10 cases with type D1, 7 cases with type D2, 3 cases with type D3, and 1 case with type D4. The mean time from injury to operation was (12.4 +/- 2.7) months. All patients were treated with Acutrak headless compression screw fixation (6 cases received 2 screws fixation, 15 cases received 1 screw fixation, and Matti-Russe bone grafting was applied in 7 cases). The carpal height, the scaphoid index and changes of the scapholunate angle were assessed before and after the operation. Range of motion and grip strength were recorded and the wrist function was assessed according to the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE).Average duration of follow-up was (21.3 +/- 3.6) months. All the patients attained radiological union in a mean time of (13.3 +/- 2.4) weeks following the operation. No obvious complications were recorded. The surgical treatment allowed the preoperative mean scaphoid index of 0.61 +/- 0.13 and the preoperative mean scapholunate angle of (59.4 +/- 6.8) degree to be improved to 0.69 +/- 0.10 and (44.3 +/- 8.2)degree postoperatively, respectively. There was a substantial improvement in grip strength and pain amelioration after surgery. The preoperative mean PRWE score of 45.2 +/- 4.7 was improved to 76.1 +/- 5.2 postoperatively. All patients returned back to the original work,the average time from surgery to work was (6.0 +/- 1.1) months.For scaphoid non-unions, Acutrak headless compression screw fixation can provide anatomical reduction, provide satisfactory results with a high union rate, well return of function and minimal complications in the early stage.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974416","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.676964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.561903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.489076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.355411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.114828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.0524874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Scaphoid bone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaphoid_bone"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Friction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Decapitation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapitation"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Land improvement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_improvement"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Grip strength","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_strength"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"D-type asteroid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-type_asteroid"}]}
