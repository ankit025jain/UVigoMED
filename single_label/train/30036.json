{"id":30036,"title":"Trends and changes in prescription opioid analgesic dispensing in Canada 2005-2012: an update with a focus on recent interventions.","abstract":"Prescription opioid analgesic (POA) utilization has steeply increased globally, yet is far higher in established market economies than elsewhere. Canada features the world's second-highest POA consumption rates. Following increases in POA-related harm, several POA control interventions have been implemented since 2010.We examined trends and patterns in POA dispensing in Canada by province for 2005-2012, including a focus on the potential effects of interventions. Data on annual dispensing of individual POA formulations--categorized into 'weak opioids' and 'strong opioids'--from a representative sub-sample of 5,700 retail pharmacies across Canada (from IMS Brogan's Compuscript) were converted into Defined Daily Doses (DDD), and examined intra- and inter-provincially as well as for Canada (total).Total POA dispensing--driven by strong opioids--increased across Canada until 2011; four provinces indicated decreases in strong opioid dispensing; seven provinces indicated decreases specifically in oxycodone dispensing, 2011-2012. The dispensing ratio weak/strong opioids decreased substantively. Major inter-provincial differences in POA dispensing levels and qualitative patterns of POA formulations dispensed persisted. Previous increasing trends in POA dispensing were reversed in select provinces 2011-2012, coinciding with POA-related interventions.Further examinations regarding the sustained nature, drivers and consequences of the recent trend changes in POA dispensing--including possible 'substitution effects' for oxycodone reductions--are needed.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24572005","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.383063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.369885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.244756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Market economy","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.133635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Oxycodone","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Religious conversion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Emergency medical technician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Provinces of Costa Rica","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Costa_Rica"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Prison Officers Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Officers_Association"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Trends (short story)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trends_(short_story)"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Oil consumption","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_consumption"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Substitute good","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_good"},{"name":"Substantive due process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantive_due_process"},{"name":"Defined (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defined_(album)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Retail","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail"}]}
