{"id":79124,"title":"Z-plasty of the alar subunit to correct nasal vestibular stenosis.","abstract":"Nasal vestibular stenosis can result in a challenging cosmetic deformity, for which a variety of techniques have been described, including scar excision and replacement with local flaps, composite or cartilage grafts, with or without stents. We describe the Z-plasty technique to widen the alar base and assess patient satisfaction from the surgery. A retrospective review of patients who underwent Z-plasty to the alar subunit for nasal vestibular stenosis over a 4-year period was conducted. Demographic data and patient satisfaction were evaluated using pre- and postoperative visual analog scores and Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation questionnaires. Eight patients underwent the procedure, and all confirmed significant improvement in their esthetic outcome. We describe our Z-plasty technique to the alar base and review patient satisfaction.
