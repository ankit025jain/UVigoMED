{"id":30592,"title":"CANABIC: CANnabis and Adolescents: effect of a Brief Intervention on their Consumption--study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"Cannabis is the most consumed illegal substance in France. General practitioners (GPs) are the health professionals who are most consulted by adolescents. Brief intervention (BI) is a promising care initiative for the consumption of cannabis, and could be a tool for GPs in caring for adolescents who consume cannabis. The aim of the CANABIC study is to measure the impact of a BI carried out by a GP on the consumption of cannabis by adolescents of 15 to 25 years of age.A randomized clustered controlled trial, stratified over three areas (Auvergne, Languedoc-Roussillon, and Rhône - Alpes), comparing an intervention group, which carries out the BI in consultation, and a control group, which ensures routine medical care. The main assessment criterion is the consumption of cannabis by amount of joints per month, at 12 months. The amount necessary to highlight a significant difference between the two groups of 30% of consumption at 12 months is 250 patients (50 GPs, 5 patients per GP; risk ??=?5%; power?=?90%; intra-cluster correlation coefficient ??=?0.2; Hawthorne effect?=?15%; lost to follow-up rates for GPs?=?10% and for patients?=?20%). This plan is replicated for the three areas, and therefore a total of 750 patients are expected.The secondary criteria for judgment are the associated consumption of tobacco and alcohol, the perception of the consequences of consumption, and the driving of a vehicle following consumption.Research about BI for young cannabis users is underway. The aim of the CANABIC study is to validate a BI suited to adolescents who consume cannabis, which may be performed in the general practice. This would provide a tool for their treatment by a GP, which could be widely distributed during initial or further medical training.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479702","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.888229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"France","weight":0.777234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.72288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.644547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.633153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.614946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.548184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.530327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.516493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Controlled substance","weight":0.30993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.222908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Initiative","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Hawthorne effect","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Treaty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty"},{"name":"Driving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Cannabis smoking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_smoking"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Judgement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"}]}
