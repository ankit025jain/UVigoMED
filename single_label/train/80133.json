{"id":80133,"title":"Th17 cells are associated with the Th1/Th2?cell balance during Echinococcus multilocularis infection.","abstract":"The present study investigated the immunopathological effect of Echinococcus multilocularis (Em) using cytokine detection. Expression of the T?helper (Th) 17?cytokine, interleukin 17 (IL?17), was observed using immunohistochemical staining, and levels of cytokines, including IL?17, transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF??1), IL?6, interferon ? (IFN??) and IL?4, were assessed using ELISA at different stages of infection. IL?17 expression occurred in hepatic cells at 1 month post?infection, reached a maximum at 3 months post?infection and then decreased gradually. Compared with the uninfected control, levels of the cytokines IL?17, TGF??1, IL?6, IFN?? and IL?4 exhibited different dynamic patterns when infected with Em. In the immune response during the whole infection period, Th17 cells play an important role by secreting IL?17, which may be involved in the Th1/Th2?cell balance during the immune response. Th17 cells are associated with immunopathology in Em infection.
