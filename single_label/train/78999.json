{"id":78999,"title":"Lack of correlation between HRM metrics and symptoms during the manometric protocol.","abstract":"Although esophageal motor disorders are associated with chest pain and dysphagia, minimal data support a direct relationship between abnormal motor function and symptoms. This study investigated whether high-resolution manometry (HRM) metrics correlate with symptoms.Consecutive HRM patients without previous surgery were enrolled. HRM studies included 10 supine liquid, 5 upright liquid, 2 upright viscous, and 2 upright solid swallows. All patients evaluated their esophageal symptom for each upright swallow. Symptoms were graded on a 4-point likert score (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe). The individual liquid, viscous or solid upright swallow with the maximal symptom score was selected for analysis in each patient. HRM metrics were compared between groups with and without symptoms during the upright liquid protocol and the provocative protocols separately.A total of 269 patients recorded symptoms during the upright liquid swallows and 72 patients had a swallow symptom score of 1 or greater. Of the 269 patients, 116 recorded symptoms during viscous or solid swallows. HRM metrics were similar between swallows with and without associated symptoms in the upright, viscous, and solid swallows. No correlation was noted between HRM metrics and symptom scores among swallow types.Esophageal symptoms are not related to abnormal motor function defined by HRM during liquid, viscous or solid bolus swallows in the upright position. Other factors beyond circular muscle contraction patterns should be explored as possible causes of symptom generation.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513804","annotations":[{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.850827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Viscosity","weight":0.617732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity"},{"name":"Chest pain","weight":0.615107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.609835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.409082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.393529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Supine position","weight":0.10298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position"},{"name":"Pressure measurement","weight":0.0952762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_measurement"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.0550013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0524933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Manometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manometry"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Electric motor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Direct relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_relationship"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Swallow","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
