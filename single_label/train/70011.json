{"id":70011,"title":"[Optimization of approaches to the surgical treatment of patients with benign breast gland tumors].","abstract":"The results of 95 patients treatment with benign brest gland tumours (BBGT) were studied. For improve the results of treatment the introduction of surgical techniques that reduce the invasiveness of operations were applied. The performance of preoperative ultrasound (US) marking BB GT, cosmetically non-traumatic incisions, US dissector, combined cosmetic suture applay for the glandular tissue after sectoral resection of brest gland contribute to improving the results of surgical treatment, which is confirmed by the auspicious course of the early postoperative period.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252558","annotations":[{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.726578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.667881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.645467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.398039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Base on balls","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls"},{"name":"Fresco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Economic sector","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sector"}]}
