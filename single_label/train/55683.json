{"id":55683,"title":"Primary orbital plasmacytoma mimicking lacrimal gland tumor.","abstract":"Extramedullary plasmacytoma is a rare plasma cell malignancy, comprising 3% of the whole group. The involvement of orbit is even rarer since 80% of extramedullary plasmacytoma have been reported from upper respiratory tract, followed by gastrointestinal tract. The disease is thrice more common in males than females and is more common in 6th to 7th decade of life, but we are reporting a case of extramedullary plasmacytoma presenting as lacrimal gland tumor in a 59-year-old female. The correct diagnosis is essential since the disease is highly radiosensitive and responds well to radiotherapy unlike other malignancy in this region. A high index of suspicion with imaging and careful use of fine needle aspiration cytology helps in diagnosis and prompt treatment.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24832726","annotations":[{"name":"Lacrimal gland","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_gland"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.832852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Plasmacytoma","weight":0.815617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmacytoma"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.813197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.80241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.582245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Upper respiratory tract","weight":0.20453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.161245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0958748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"}]}
