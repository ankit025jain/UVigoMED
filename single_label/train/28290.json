{"id":28290,"title":"[Advance in studies on dopamine system related genetic polymorphisms associated with nicotine dependence].","abstract":"Nicotine is the main component for smoking addiction. It is widely believed that nicotine dependence is heritable. Many studies are committed to study the effects of specific gene polymorphisms connect with nicotine dependence. Release of dopamine has been considered the most important channel for nicotine dependence. This paper provides a review for recent advance in studies on dopamine system related genetic polymorphisms associated with nicotine dependence.
