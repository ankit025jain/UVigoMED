{"id":68442,"title":"Sustained high protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B activity in the sperm of obese males impairs the sperm acrosome reaction.","abstract":"Evidence of a causal link between male obesity and subfertility or infertility has been demonstrated previously. However, the mechanism underlying this link is incompletely understood. Here, we report that sustained high protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) activity in sperm of obese donors plays an essential role in coupling male obesity and subfertility or infertility. First, PTP1B level and activity were significantly higher in sperm from ob/ob mice than in wild-type littermates. High PTP1B level and activity in sperm was also observed in obese patients compared with non-obese donors. The enhanced sperm PTP1B level and activity in ob/ob mice and obese patients correlated with a defect of the sperm acrosome reaction (AR). Second, treating sperm from male ob/ob mice or obese men with a specific PTP1B inhibitor largely restored the sperm AR. Finally, blockade of sperm AR by enhanced PTP1B activity in male ob/ob mice or obese men was due to prolonged dephosphorylation of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor by PTP1B, leading to the inability to reassemble the trans-SNARE complexes, which is a critical step in sperm acrosomal exocytosis. In summary, our study demonstrates for the first time that a sustained high PTP1B level or activity in the sperm of obese donors causes a defect of sperm AR and that PTP1B is a novel potential therapeutic target for male infertility treatment.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519936","annotations":[{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.643183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Male infertility","weight":0.624073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_infertility"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.450483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Acrosome","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrosome"},{"name":"Acrosome reaction","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrosome_reaction"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.110757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.0542089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Exocytosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocytosis"},{"name":"PTPN1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPN1"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Subfertility","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfertility"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"First baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"PTP (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTP_(band)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Blockade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Scotland B national football team","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_B_national_football_team"}]}
