{"id":38021,"title":"Transient neonatal zinc deficiency due to a new autosomal dominant mutation in gene SLC30A2 (ZnT-2).","abstract":"Transient neonatal zinc deficiency (TNZD) has a clinical presentation similar to that of acrodermatitis enteropathica but is caused by a low zinc concentration in maternal breast milk. TNZD becomes clinically evident during breastfeeding and is resolved by weaning and the introduction of complementary nutrition. We present a 4-month-old girl with TNZD due to a new autosomal dominant mutation (663delC) in the maternal SLC30A2 gene not previously described in the literature.
