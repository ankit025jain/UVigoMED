{"id":13372,"title":"Tenascin-C causes neuronal apoptosis after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats.","abstract":"The role of tenascin-C (TNC), a matricellular protein, in brain injury is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine if TNC causes neuronal apoptosis after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a deadly cerebrovascular disorder, using imatinib mesylate (a selective inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR] that is reported to suppress TNC induction) and recombinant TNC. SAH by endovascular perforation caused caspase-dependent neuronal apoptosis in the cerebral cortex irrespective of cerebral vasospasm development at 24 and 72 h post-SAH, associated with PDGFR activation, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation, and TNC induction in rats. PDGFR inactivation by an intraperitoneal injection of imatinib mesylate prevented neuronal apoptosis, as well as MAPKs activation and TNC induction in the cerebral cortex at 24 h. A cisternal injection of recombinant TNC reactivated MAPKs and abolished anti-apoptotic effects of imatinib mesylate. The TNC injection also induced TNC itself in SAH brain, which may internally augment neuronal apoptosis after SAH. These findings suggest that TNC upregulation by PDGFR activation causes neuronal apoptosis via MAPK activation, and that the positive feedback mechanisms may exist to augment neuronal apoptosis after SAH. TNC-induced neuronal apoptosis would be a new target to improve outcome after SAH.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481545","annotations":[{"name":"Subarachnoid hemorrhage","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.872586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.75702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Vasospasm","weight":0.703373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasospasm"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Platelet-derived growth factor receptor","weight":0.468667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet-derived_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Positive feedback","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.379295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.377784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Subarachnoid space","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_space"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.15266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0509955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.0239124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Tenascin C","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenascin_C"}]}
