{"id":46350,"title":"Defining the role of adjuvant therapy: ampullary and duodenal adenocarcinoma.","abstract":"Adenocarcinomas of the ampulla of Vater and duodenum are more rare than pancreatic cancer and have a better prognosis. However, studies conducted on the management of these cancers, such as adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy, are limited by small sample sizes and series that are retrospective. This review evaluates ampullary and duodenal adenocarcinomas with regard to incidence, anatomy, prognostic features, patterns of failure, and the available literature studying adjuvant therapy.
