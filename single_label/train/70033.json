{"id":70033,"title":"[Suppression of tumor antigen-specific T cell immune responses by regulatory T cells].","abstract":"CD4? CD25? FOXP3? regulatory T cells(Tregs)play important roles in maintaining self-tolerance in vivo by suppressing self antigen- reactive T cells. In the tumor microenvironment, tumor cells produce several chemokines and attract Tregs, resulting in suppression of tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8? T cell activation. Controlling the suppressive function of Tregs to recover anti-tumor immune responses in the tumor microenvironment is critical to improve the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy. Many immune-checkpoint blockade reagents, including antibodies against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA- 4), programmed cell death (PD)-1, and PD-L1, have been tested in the clinic and elicit clinical responses in several types of cancers. Importantly, clinical responses in melanoma patients treated with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody were associated with a reduced number of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, in addition to activating or expanding antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, modulating the number and/or function of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment is the next important challenge in the field of cancer immunotherapy.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25248887","annotations":[{"name":"CD25","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.817574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Cancer immunotherapy","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_immunotherapy"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.701752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.44099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.136828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"}]}
