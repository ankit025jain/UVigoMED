{"id":55151,"title":"Topical cyclosporine a 0.05% eyedrops in the treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis - randomized placebo-controlled trial.","abstract":"Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a chronic, bilateral inflammation of the conjunctiva that mostly affects children and young adult males. Management of VKC is primarily aimed at reducing symptoms and preventing serious vision threatening sequelae.To assess the efficacy of topical cyclosporine A (CsA) 0.05% on the signs and symtomps in the management of VKC.This is a placebo-controlled, randomized prospective study. Sixty-two patients with VKC were included in this study. Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to treatment with topical 0.05% CsA eyedrops or a placebo (artificial tears) for a period of 4 weeks, 4 times daily. Ocular signs and symptoms were in all patients scored at entry and at the end of 4 weeks.When pre-treatment mean signs and symptoms scores were compared in both groups, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05). However, mean post-treatment scores as regards signs and symptoms were found to be lower in cyclosporine group than those in placebo group (p < 0.001). No side effects of the treatment with CsA 0.05% eyedrops were observed.It was found that topical CsA 0.05% eyedrops were safe and effective in the treatment of patients with VKC.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24979519","annotations":[{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.774952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.466442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.286275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Vernal keratoconjunctivitis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernal_keratoconjunctivitis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Artificial tears","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_tears"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Vernal, Utah","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernal,_Utah"}]}
