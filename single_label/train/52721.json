{"id":52721,"title":"Unique features and insights from mucinous tumors of ovary in childhood: clinicopathological study of 15 cases including four premenarchal cases.","abstract":"Mucinous tumors of ovary are primarily diagnosed in middle-aged and elder woman. They are very infrequent in the first two decades of life and exceedingly rare in premenarchal girls. We reviewed the past 20Â years of our institutional pathology files and studied the clinicopathological features of the childhood ovarian mucinous tumor cases. The study concluded that ovarian mucinous tumor cases in childhood, including premenarchal cases, may not be as rare as people previously estimated and discovered some unique features of the tumors in this age group that are beneficial for better prognosis prediction and clinical management, as well as better understanding of pathogenesis of ovarian epithelial tumors.
