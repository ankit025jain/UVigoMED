{"id":55623,"title":"Preliminary investigation of corneal wavefront aberration following femtosecond laser clear corneal incision for cataract surgery.","abstract":"To investigate the early changes of the anterior corneal wavefront aberration (WA) following femtosecond laser clear corneal incision (FS-CCI) for cataract surgery.Twenty consecutive patients (20 eyes) with cataract underwent phacoemulsification and were divided into 2 groups: the study group received a 2.75-mm FS-CCI using an iFS Intralase; the control group received a 2.75-mm manual CCI using disposable knives. High-order corneal WA was analyzed over 3.5- and 6.0-mm pupils and corneal astigmatism was evaluated using vector analysis preoperatively, 1 week postoperatively, and 1 month postoperatively.At 1 month postoperatively, the mean surgically induced astigmatism (D) of the anterior cornea was 1.22 ± 0.60 at 144° and 1.04 D ± 0.64 at 90° in the study and control groups (p&lt;0.05), respectively. Over 3.5-mm pupil, there were no changes of corneal high-order aberrations (p&gt;0.05) following FS-CCI. Trefoil increased significantly (p&lt;0.01) following manual CCI at 1 week postoperatively. Over 6.0-mm pupil, FS-CCI did not induce any statistically significant change in corneal WA during follow-up. One week after manual CCI, total root mean square-high order aberrations (p&lt;0.01), spherical aberration (p&lt;0.05), and trefoil (p&lt;0.001) were statistically significantly higher than preoperatively.The CCI method was shown to influence changes in corneal WA during the first month postoperatively. The different changes of corneal high-order WA between the study and control groups may depend on the different CCI geometry. These preliminary data are valuable to improve understanding of FS-CCI design.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24846626","annotations":[{"name":"Spherical aberration","weight":0.893535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.819666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Wavefront","weight":0.649337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.642039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.437771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.423377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.379879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Euclidean vector","weight":0.249696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.181044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.102441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Vector calculus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus"},{"name":"Trefoil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Knife","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"TRS connector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_connector"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"List of The Muppet Show episodes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Muppet_Show_episodes"},{"name":"75 mm Gun M2/M3/M6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75_mm_Gun_M2/M3/M6"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Washington (state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)"},{"name":"Malagasy language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malagasy_language"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Disposable","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
