{"id":79216,"title":"The interpolation nasolabial flap: the advantageous solution for nasal tip reconstruction in elderly and polymorbid patients.","abstract":"Nasal tip is one of the most frequent areas affected by basocellular carcinoma. The treatment must avoid any postsurgical deformity, as the nasal tip is the main part of the facial triangle. Most of these patients are elderly and polymorbid. The surgeon must find a compromise between the cosmetic effect and an acceptable stress for the patient.There were five methods of nasal tip reconstruction used on a group of fifty elderly patients with various medical comorbidities: skin graft, bilobed flap, dorsal nasal flap, forehead flap and interpolation nasolabial flap. The resulting cosmetic effect was objectivized by a standardized questionnaire and the advantages and disadvantages of each method were discussed.According to the characteristics that were considered (good vascular supply, matching skin color and texture, sufficient amount of material, possibility to cover exposed cartilage or to combine it with cartilaginous graft; scars of minimal visibility, perfect aesthetic outcome, use of local anesthesia, short surgical time, and technical simplicity) was the interpolation nasolabial flap found as the most appropriate.Interpolation nasolabial flap is an easy and effective method for treatment of smaller and middle-sized defects of the nasal tip with minimal stress for the patient.Level III.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
