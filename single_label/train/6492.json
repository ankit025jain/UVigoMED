{"id":6492,"title":"Fluid therapy in calves.","abstract":"Early and aggressive fluid therapy is critical in correcting the metabolic complications associated with calf diarrhea. Oral electrolyte therapy can be used with success in calves, but careful consideration should be given to the type of oral electrolyte used. Electrolyte solutions with high osmolalities can significantly slow abomasal emptying and can be a risk factor for abomasal bloat in calves. Milk should not be withheld from calves with diarrhea for more than 12 to 24 hours. Hypertonic saline and hypertonic sodium bicarbonate can be used effectively for intravenous fluid therapy on farms when intravenous catheterization is not possible.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24980729","annotations":[{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Sodium bicarbonate","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate"},{"name":"Electrolyte","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Intravenous fluid","weight":0.79017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_fluid"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bicarbonate","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.704294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.680583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tonicity","weight":0.646783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.585085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.353006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.328262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Fluid replacement","weight":0.214447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_replacement"},{"name":"Bloat","weight":0.127267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloat"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
