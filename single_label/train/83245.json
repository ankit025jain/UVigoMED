{"id":83245,"title":"Stability against brushing abrasion and the erosion-protective effect of different fluoride compounds.","abstract":"This study aimed to analyse the impact of brushing on the protective effect of different fluoride solutions on enamel and dentin erosion. Bovine enamel and dentin specimens were rinsed once with TiF4, AmF, SnF2 (0.5 M F, 2 min) or water (control). Specimens were either left unbrushed or brushed with 10, 20, 50, 100 or 500 brushing strokes in an automatic brushing machine (2 N, non-fluoridated toothpaste slurry). Ten specimens per group were eroded with hydrochloric acid (HCl) (pH 2.3) for 60 s, and calcium release into the acid was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Additionally, enamel and dentin surfaces were analysed by X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (n = 6/group) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (n = 2/group) before brushing and after 500 brushing strokes. Statistical analysis (p < 0.05) was performed by three- and one-way ANOVA (calcium release) or repeated measures ANOVA (EDS). TiF4, AmF and SnF2 reduced the erosive calcium loss in unbrushed specimens to 58-67% (enamel) and 23-31% (dentin) of control. Calcium release increased with increasing brushing strokes prior to erosion and amounted to 70-88% (enamel) and 45-78% (dentin) of control after 500 brushing strokes. Brushing reduced the surface concentration of fluoride (AmF), tin (SnF2) and titanium (TiF4). SEM revealed that surface precipitates were affected by long-term brushing. Brushing reduced the protective potential of TiF4, AmF and SnF2 solutions. However, considering a small number of brushing strokes, the protective effect of fluoride solutions is only slightly affected by brushing abrasion.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401733","annotations":[{"name":"Hydrochloric acid","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid"},{"name":"Hydrogen chloride","weight":0.872586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_chloride"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.845791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Tin","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.785426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.714499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.704066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Atomic absorption spectroscopy","weight":0.691396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_absorption_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Precipitation (chemistry)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.647429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.618007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.496945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.487637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.456138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Vitreous enamel","weight":0.424369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel"},{"name":"Absorption spectroscopy","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Slurry","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurry"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.203192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0824005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy","weight":0.0392089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy-dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Tin(II) fluoride","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_fluoride"},{"name":"Tooth brushing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_brushing"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"}]}
