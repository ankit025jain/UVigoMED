{"id":79620,"title":"[The comparative characteristic of methods of laboratory diagnostic of opisthorchiasis].","abstract":"The analysis of samples of blood serums and copromaterial from patients was carried out to evaluate effectiveness of diagnostic of opisthorchiasis invasion. The Kato-Miura technique of thick film under cellophane layer and sedimentation technique of acetic etheric precipitation were applied for parasitologic diagnostic. The technique of immunoenzymometric analysis was applied for serological diagnostic. The analysis of detection rate of eggs of opistorchis in copromaterial and level of anti-opistorchis antibodies in samples of blood serum of patients demonstrated the presence of strong direct correlation relationship between these indicators. It is demonstrated that for laboratory diagnostic of opisthorchiasis it is impossible to limit oneself to some single technique. It is established that on the territories with middle and low level of population infection rate of opistorchis it is appropriate to apply complex of methods including analysis of blood serum for presence of specific immunoglobulins to antigens of opistorchis and twice or thrice analysis of feces with copro-ovoscopic methods.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080800","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.740334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.721734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.661557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.46559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.270177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.176462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Sedimentation","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation"},{"name":"Precipitation (meteorology)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Cellophane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellophane"},{"name":"Opisthorchis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opisthorchis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Wafer (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafer_(electronics)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Territory (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
