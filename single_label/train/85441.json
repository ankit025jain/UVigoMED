{"id":85441,"title":"Anesthetic management of hysterosalpingooophorectomy in a case with severe idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.","abstract":"Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is a primary myocardial disease with unknown aetiology. This disease follows a prospective course that is characterized by ventricular dilation and impaired myocardial dilation. Congestive heart failure and malignant arrhythmias are the most widespread complications. The incidence of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in the general population is 5-8/100.000. Because of the increased risks of perioperative complications, anesthetic management of this disease requires the application of a specific technique. This case report demonstrates the application of successful regional anesthetic management (thoracic epidural anesthesia) in a patient who had been diagnosed with severe idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24937943","annotations":[{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.728281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.664956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.643183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dilated cardiomyopathy","weight":0.191245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilated_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Regional anaesthesia","weight":0.112555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
