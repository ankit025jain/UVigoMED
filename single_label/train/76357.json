{"id":76357,"title":"[The conformation of apoB-100 in phylogenetically and functionally different lipoproteins of low and very low density: algorithm of formation of phenotypes of hyper lipoproteinimia (a lecture)].","abstract":"The cells' malabsorption of three classes of lipoproteins--chylomicrons and lipoproteins of low and very low density,--form under electrophoresis six phenotypes of hyperlipoproteinemia. In phylogenesis, cells absorb lipoproteins in a consecutive way by apoE/B-48, apoB-100 and apoE/B-100 receptor endocytosis. The domain-ligand in lipoproteins of very low density is forming when apoB-100 takes active conformation \"deformed bilayer apoprotein-lipid\" in association with domain apoE apoE/B-100 ligand is formed. Another active conformation apoB-100 in domain is globule with lipids in \"pocket\" forming apoB-100 ligand In blood 9 subclasses are formed: pre-ligand and post-ligand chylomicrons, lipoproteins with low density and lipoproteins with very low density. The ligand lipoproteins bind receptors of membrane and absorb cells. Both pre-chylomicrons, pre-lipoproteins with low density, pre-lipoproteins with very low density and post-chylomicrons, post-lipoproteins with low density, post-lipoproteins with very low density remain in blood. The sub-classes of lipoproteins form at electrophoregram 6 phenotypes of hyperlipoproteinemia: phenotype I-pre-chylomicrons + pre-lipoproteins with very low density; phenotype IIa--post-lipoproteins with low density; phenotype IIb--pre-lipoproteins with very low density; phenotype III--post-chylomicrons + pre-lipoproteins with very low density; phenotype IV--pre-lipoproteins with very low density; phenotype V--pre-chylomicrons + post-chylomicrons + pre-lipoproteins with very low density + post-lipoproteins with very low density. The formation under electrophoresis of primary phenotypes and secondary types of hyperlipoproteinemia occurs according single algorithm. In aphysiological sense, the major mass of palmitic and oleic lipoproteins with very low density absorb cells without transformation into lipoproteins with low density. Only linoleic and linolenic lipoproteins with very low density which are formed after binding of apoB-100 of triglycerides the same name and which are not much in blood acquire density of lipoproteins with low density physiologically. Under high content of triglycerides in blood main mass of lipoproteins with low density consists of aphysiologic palmitic lipoproteins with very low density with hydrated density lipoproteins with low density, the cause of hyperlipoproteinemia of phenotype III is genotype e21e2 apoE; hyperlipoproteinemia of phenotype V--genotype e4/e4 and probably toxic inhibition of activity (synthesis) phylogenetically late stearil-KoA-desaturase-2.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069220","annotations":[{"name":"Endocytosis","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis"},{"name":"Lipid bilayer","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_bilayer"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.747207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.743269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.739962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.703731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Malabsorption","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malabsorption"},{"name":"Chylomicron","weight":0.583062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chylomicron"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.547229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.487498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Very low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.42987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein B","weight":0.345962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_B"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.319367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.311544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Linoleic acid","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein E","weight":0.26721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.243501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Oleic acid","weight":0.232227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleic_acid"},{"name":"Palmitic acid","weight":0.157091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitic_acid"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.136552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0730188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Hydrate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrate"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"}]}
