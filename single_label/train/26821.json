{"id":26821,"title":"[The association of risk of development of cardiomyopathies with polymorphic variants of genes of angiotensin converting enzyme, glutathione-S-transferase, interleukins 8 and 10].","abstract":"The article presents the results of study of association of risk of development and clinical course of cardiomyopathies with polymorphic variants of genes ACE, GSTM1, IL8 and IL10. The purpose of research was to find out molecular genetic markers of risk of development and clinical course of various types of cardiomyopathies. The analysis used the DNA samples extracted from lymphocytes of peripheral venous blood of patients with cardiomyopathies (N = 89) and control group (N = 426). The standard analysis techniques of polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism were applied to detect polymorphic loci of genes candidates. It is established that genotype of DD-polymorphic locus of I/DgeneACE is a marker of development of ischemic cardiomyopathy. The allele D is a marker of development of increased rate of manifestation of extra-systoles, growth of inter-ventricular septum and reduction of fraction of discharge in patients with cardiomyopathies.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080784","annotations":[{"name":"Restriction fragment length
