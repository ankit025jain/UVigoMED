{"id":92324,"title":"Plantar pressure characteristics in hallux valgus feet.","abstract":"Due to the pathoanatomical changes in hallux valgus feet, the plantar flexion moment of the first metatarsophalangeal joint is reduced. Therefore, load bearing of the hallux is decreased during push-off. We assessed loading parameters in hallux valgus feet. Based on dorsal-plantar weight bearing radiographs of 61 feet, the intermetatarsal-, hallux valgus-, distal metatarsal articulation-angle, and sesamoid position were evaluated. Plantar pressure assessment was performed with the emedÂ® system during level walking. We found negative correlations between hallux valgus angle and peak pressure in the great toe (r=-0.301, p<0.023), the maximum force of the hallux (r=-0.481, p<0.001), and contact time of the great toe (r=-0.448, p<0.001), and positive correlations for force time integral (r=0.348, p<0.001), contact area (r=0.307, p<0.020), maximum force (r=0.430, p<0.001), and peak pressure (r=0.361, p<0.006) of the fifth metatarsal head. A positive correlation between the sesamoid and the metatarsal subluxation regarding maximum force (r=0.294, p<0.034), and a negative correlation between the contact area of the hallux (r=-0.232, p<0.020) was shown. Depending on the severity, hallux valgus angle, and sesamoid subluxation, load shows significant lateral transmission in hallux valgus feet.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25130961","annotations":[{"name":"Hallux","weight":0.907207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallux"},{"name":"Metatarsophalangeal articulations","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsophalangeal_articulations"},{"name":"Metatarsus","weight":0.865084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsus"},{"name":"Bunion","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunion"},{"name":"Plantarflexion","weight":0.794585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantarflexion"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Sesamoid bone","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesamoid_bone"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.738423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Plantar","weight":0.737959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Intermetatarsal articulations","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermetatarsal_articulations"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.461266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Fifth metatarsal bone","weight":0.355861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_metatarsal_bone"},{"name":"Valgus deformity","weight":0.339185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgus_deformity"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.233016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Pedobarography","weight":0.0555992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedobarography"},{"name":"Subluxation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subluxation"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"361","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/361"},{"name":"448","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/448"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Foot (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Load-bearing wall","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load-bearing_wall"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
