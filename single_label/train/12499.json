{"id":12499,"title":"A recombinant Hendra virus G glycoprotein subunit vaccine protects nonhuman primates against Hendra virus challenge.","abstract":"Hendra virus (HeV) is a zoonotic emerging virus belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae. HeV causes severe and often fatal respiratory and/or neurologic disease in both animals and humans. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or antiviral drugs approved for human use. A number of animal models have been developed for studying HeV infection, with the African green monkey (AGM) appearing to most faithfully reproduce the human disease. Here, we assessed the utility of a newly developed recombinant subunit vaccine based on the HeV attachment (G) glycoprotein in the AGM model. Four AGMs were vaccinated with two doses of the HeV vaccine (sGHeV) containing Alhydrogel, four AGMs received the sGHeV with Alhydrogel and CpG, and four control animals did not receive the sGHeV vaccine. Animals were challenged with a high dose of infectious HeV 21 days after the boost vaccination. None of the eight specifically vaccinated animals showed any evidence of clinical illness and survived the challenge. All four controls became severely ill with symptoms consistent with HeV infection, and three of the four animals succumbed 8 days after exposure. Success of the recombinant subunit vaccine in AGMs provides pivotal data in supporting its further preclinical development for potential human use.A Hendra virus attachment (G) glycoprotein subunit vaccine was tested in nonhuman primates to assess its ability to protect them from a lethal infection with Hendra virus. It was found that all vaccinated African green monkeys were completely protected against subsequent Hendra virus infection and disease. The success of this new subunit vaccine in nonhuman primates provides critical data in support of its further development for future human use.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522928","annotations":[{"name":"Henipavirus","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus"},{"name":"Paramyxovirus","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramyxovirus"},{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.731134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Chlorocebus","weight":0.669784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorocebus"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.647186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.644593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.629021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.355173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Monkey","weight":0.315301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.241771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Attachment theory","weight":0.232661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.187384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.128658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
