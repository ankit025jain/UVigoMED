{"id":55602,"title":"Periocular hemangiomas and lymphangiomas.","abstract":"Infantile hemangiomas are the most common benign tumor of childhood. Lymphangiomas are benign hamartomatous vascular tumors. Both lesions can be problematic when located in the periocular region. Pediatricians must be familiar with the characteristics of each which would necessitate referral to an ophthalmologist or other subspecialist for evaluation, including obstruction of the visual axis which can lead to amblyopia of the affected eye. Additional potential complications include proptosis, ocular motility limitation, optic nerve injury, and poor eyelid closure with or without corneal surface disease. All children with periocular hemangiomas or lymphangiomas should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation.
