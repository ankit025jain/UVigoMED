{"id":65892,"title":"Comparison of clinical outcomes between \"ideal\" and \"nonideal\" transobturator male sling patients for treatment of postprostatectomy incontinence.","abstract":"To review the clinical outcomes of \"ideal\" vs \"nonideal\" postprostatectomy stress urinary incontinence (PPI) patients who underwent male sling placement.The medical records of 95 consecutive patients with PPI who underwent male sling insertion (AdVance male sling, American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, MN) were reviewed. Patients were divided into \"ideal\" vs \"nonideal\" cohorts. The ideal group consisted of patients with mild to moderate incontinence (<4 pads/day or <300 g daily pad weight), ability to volitionally contract the external urinary sphincter, no history of pelvic radiation or cryotherapy, no history of previous anti-incontinence surgical procedures, the ability to generate a volitional detrusor contraction when voiding, and a postvoid residual urine volume <100 mL. Patients in the nonideal group did not satisfy all these criteria.Significant reductions in daily pad usage and weight were noted in both cohorts. In the ideal patient group, 66 of 72 patients (92%) would undergo the procedure again. Conversely, only 7 of 23 nonideal men (30%) would undergo the procedure again.Preoperative patient selection can influence favorable outcomes after the treatment of PPI with AdVance male slings. Attention to ideal vs nonideal patient characteristics should be used when counseling men considering male sling surgery.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767526","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.819453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Cryotherapy","weight":0.741261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.707668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.544856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.425309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.379345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Detrusor urinae muscle","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detrusor_urinae_muscle"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Minnetonka, Minnesota","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnetonka,_Minnesota"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Minnesota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Sling (weapon)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_(weapon)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Breast reduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reduction"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Free will","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"}]}
