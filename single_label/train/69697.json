{"id":69697,"title":"Acetylation of snail modulates the cytokinome of cancer cells to enhance the recruitment of macrophages.","abstract":"Snail is primarily known as a transcriptional repressor that induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition by suppressing adherent proteins. Emerging evidence suggests that Snail can act as an activator; however, the mechanism and biological significance are unclear. Here, we found that CREB-binding protein (CBP) is the critical factor in Snail-mediated target gene transactivation. CBP interacts with Snail and acetylates SnailÂ at lysine 146 and lysine 187, which prevents the repressor complex formation. We further identified several Snail-activated targets, including TNF-?, which is also the upstream signal for Snail acetylation, and CCL2 and CCL5, which promote the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages. Here, we present our results on the mechanism by which Snail induces target gene transactivation to remodel the tumor microenvironment.
