{"id":53158,"title":"Utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT in follow-up of patients with low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary.","abstract":"Ovarian low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) is a rare and indolent tumor. The utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT in monitoring patients with LGSC has not been established. We assessed the accuracy and clinical impact of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with ovarian LGSC after initial treatment.A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with ovarian LGSC who had undergone 18F-FDG PET/CT scans during follow-up after primary treatment. The impact of 18F-FDG PET/CT on the management plan was assessed. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT findings in the detection of recurrence were calculated. Total lesion glycolysis (TLG) was determined to assess metabolic activity of tumors. Potential prognostic factors for disease-free and overall survival after recurrence were assessed.Forty-eight patients were included in the analysis, 39 with recurrent disease and 9 without recurrence. A total of 91 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were performed, and 30% of these (27/91) had an impact on the management plan. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in the detection of LGSC recurrence were 94%, 100%, and 97%, respectively, for 18F-FDG PET/CT; 89%, 95%, and 93%,respectively, for CT; and 68%, 89%, and 73%, respectively, for serum CA-125. There was no significant difference in sensitivity between PET/CT and CT. Survival after recurrence was poorer in patients with a TLG value greater than 67.7g.18F-FDG PET/CT may provide useful information during the follow-up of patients with LGSC after initial treatment. TLG may be a predictor of survival after recurrence.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534359","annotations":[{"name":"Glycolysis","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.801965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.799994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.719904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.709945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"CA-125","weight":0.475974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-125"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.341876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.331104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.232612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Serous carcinoma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
