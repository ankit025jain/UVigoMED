{"id":73930,"title":"Molecular classification of breast cancer.","abstract":"Breast cancer is a complex, multifaceted disease encompassing a great variety of entities that show considerable variation in clinical, morphological and molecular attributes. Traditional classifications including histological assessment and clinical staging are used to guide patient management. In recent years, there has been exponential progress in molecular analysis with profound implications for our understanding of breast cancer biology and, hence, classification. There are now genome-based frameworks for the molecular categorisation of breast cancer including the development of prognostic and predictive signatures that potentially allow individualisation of treatment. Here we review the current state of the molecular classifications of in situ and invasive breast cancer including special subtypes. Future perspectives are also provided.
