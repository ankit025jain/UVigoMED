{"id":51667,"title":"Exploratory trial of intranasal administration of glucagon-like peptide-1 in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of our newly developed nasal glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) compound and injector.Twenty-six patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this double-blind placebo-controlled study. The nasal compound containing 1.2 mg of human GLP-1 (7-36) amide or placebo was administered immediately before every meal for 2 weeks.The plasma peak concentration of active GLP-1 was 47.2 pmol/L, and its Tmax was 8.1 min. The early phase of insulin and glucagon secretion were recovered and suppressed, respectively, in the GLP-1 group. Glycoalbumin levels became significantly lower and 1,5-anhydroglucitol levels significantly higher after GLP-1 administration. No marked adverse events were observed after using nasal GLP-1.The newly developed nasal GLP-1 compound may be a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes. The long-term application of the drug should be evaluated in future trials.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667460","annotations":[{"name":"Glucagon","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Amide","weight":0.805736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.640172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.612882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.145948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"736","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/736"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Nasal cavity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Injector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injector"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Meal","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal"}]}
