{"id":84882,"title":"Supernumerary (B) chromosomes in populations of Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. from Western Rhodopes (Bulgaria).","abstract":"Investigations on B chromosomes found for the first time for Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. have been conducted. Seeds of Picea abies from two populations of Western Rhodopes (Bulgaria) located at the southern border of species range, and protected according to Bern Convention and EC Habitat Directive were collected for this study. Mixoploidy was detected in some germinating seeds of Picea abies. It was found that metaphase cells of germinating seeds contain 0-4 B chromosomes of both metacentric and submetacentric types. The variability of B chromosomes number and their occurrence was observed. Along with B chromosomes, some chromosome aberrations such as fragments and ring chromosomes were revealed in metaphase cells of Picea abies from studied populations. The possible adaptive role of B chromosomes presence for Picea spp. is discussed.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016826","annotations":[{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Bulgaria","weight":0.692368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria"},{"name":"Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats","weight":0.619889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Conservation_of_European_Wildlife_and_Natural_Habitats"},{"name":"Picea abies","weight":0.611663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picea_abies"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.505488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Rhodope Mountains","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodope_Mountains"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.174226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Spruce","weight":0.118921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce"},{"name":"Fir","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir"},{"name":"Centromere","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere"},{"name":"Karst","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karst"},{"name":"Habitat","weight":0.0824005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat"},{"name":"Germination","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germination"},{"name":"Border","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"},{"name":"Bern","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bern"},{"name":"Metaphase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphase"},{"name":"Ring chromosome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_chromosome"},{"name":"B chromosome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_chromosome"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"European Commission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"},{"name":"Directive (European Union)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Annulus (mycology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_(mycology)"},{"name":"International Labour Organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Species distribution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_distribution"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Supernumerary","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernumerary"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"}]}
