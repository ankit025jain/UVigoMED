{"id":86616,"title":"Seasonal influenza vaccine uptake in HSE-funded hospitals and nursing homes during the 2011/2012 influenza season.","abstract":"Annual seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for all health care workers (HCWs) in Ireland. For the 2011/2012 influenza season, information was collected on influenza vaccination uptake among HCWs employed in Health Service Executive (HSE)-funded hospitals (primarily acute) and of nursing homes (NHs) and also among NH long-term and short-term respite care residents. Forty-five hospitals (80%) and 120 NHs (75%) provided uptake data. Nationally, influenza vaccine uptake among hospital employed HCWs was estimated to be 18% and 14% among HCWs in NHs; in NHs vaccine uptake among long-term care residents was estimated to 88%. These findings highlight the continued low uptake among HCWs of all categories and demonstrate the need for sustained measures to improve uptake rates.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24757889","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.821006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Ireland","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.626557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Health Service Executive","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Service_Executive"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.24466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Influenza vaccine","weight":0.202918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Executive (government)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"},{"name":"New Hampshire","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire"},{"name":"Respite care","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respite_care"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Flu season","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season"}]}
