{"id":35838,"title":"Progenitor cells of the distal lung and their potential role in neonatal lung disease.","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common adverse outcome in extreme preterm neonates (born before 28 weeks gestation). BPD is characterized by interrupted lung growth and may predispose to early-onset emphysema and poor lung function in later life. At present, there is no treatment for BPD. Recent advances in stem/progenitor cell biology have enabled the exploration of endogenous lung progenitor populations in health and disease. In parallel, exogenous stem/progenitor cell administration has shown promise in protecting the lung from injury in the experimental setting. This review will provide an outline of the progenitor populations that have currently been identified in all tissue compartments of the distal lung and how they may be affected in BPD. A thorough understanding of the lung's endogenous progenitor populations during normal development, injury and repair may one day allow us to harness their regenerative capacity.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619857","annotations":[{"name":"Emphysema","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphysema"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.575314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.487211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.425721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.409281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.331511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.177382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.150375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchopulmonary_dysplasia"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.0813771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"}]}
