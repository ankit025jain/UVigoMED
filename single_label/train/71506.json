{"id":71506,"title":"Comparison of patient reported quality of life and impact of treatment side effects experienced with a taxane-containing regimen and standard anthracycline based chemotherapy for early breast cancer: 6 year results from the UK TACT trial (CRUK/01/001).","abstract":"The TACT trial (CRUK/01/001) compared adjuvant sequential FEC-docetaxel (FEC-D) chemotherapy with standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy of similar duration in women with early breast cancer. Results at a median of 5 years suggested no improvement in disease-free survival with FEC-D. Given differing toxicity profiles of the regimens, the impact on quality of life (QL) was explored.Patients from 44 centres completed standardised QL questionnaires before chemotherapy, after cycles 4 and 8, at 9, 12, 18 and 24 months and at 6 years follow-up. Patient diaries assessed frequency, associated distress and impact on daily activity of 15 treatment related side effects.830 patients (415 FEC-D; 415 controls) contributed assessments during 0-24 months; 362 of whom participated again at 6 years. During chemotherapy, FEC-D impaired global health/QL and depression rates and significantly more QL domains than standard regimens. Novel diary card ratings highlighted significantly more distress and interference with daily activities due to FEC-D side effects compared with standard treatment. In both groups, most QL parameters returned to baseline levels by 2 years and were unchanged at 6 years.Within expected negative effects of chemotherapy on wide ranging QL domains FEC-D patients reported greater toxicity, disruption and distress during treatment with no improvement in disease outcome at 5 years than patients receiving standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Findings should inform future patients of relative costs and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065293","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.717489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.709922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.548467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.410941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.368379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.338934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.227283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.203387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cancer Research UK","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Research_UK"},{"name":"Anthracycline","weight":0.108635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthracycline"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Sinclair QL","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL"},{"name":"830","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/830"},{"name":"362","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/362"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Nielsen ratings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Card (sports)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)"},{"name":"Diary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"}]}
