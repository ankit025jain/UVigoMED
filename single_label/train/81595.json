{"id":81595,"title":"Effect of irrigation with Tetraclean on bacterial leakage of obturated root canals.","abstract":"The purpose of the study presented here was to evaluate the effect of Tetraclean, Hypoclean, Chlor-XTRA, 2% chlorhexidine and 6% sodium hypochlorite/17% EDTA as a final irrigant on bacterial leakage of the root canal. One hundred and fifty-five extracted human maxillary central incisors were randomly divided into five experimental groups of 25 teeth each and two control groups of 15 teeth each. The root canals in each group were irrigated with 2 ml of the relevant irrigant between each filing. The root canals in group 5 were irrigated with 5 ml of 17% EDTA at the end of root canal preparation. The teeth in each group were obturated with gutta-percha and AH-26 sealer. Positive control teeth were obturated with a single gutta-percha cone without sealer, and negative controls were obturated in the same way as experimental groups. The coronal portion of each root was placed in contact with inoculum of Enterococcus faecalis in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) culture media. Findings showed that the mean number of days for bacterial penetration in the Tetraclean group was greater than for other experimental groups. On the other hand, the Chlor-XTRA Vista group showed the fewest mean number of days for bacterial leakage.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24933773","annotations":[{"name":"Chlorhexidine","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Root canal","weight":0.674784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_canal"},{"name":"Sodium hypochlorite","weight":0.376707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hypochlorite"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid"},{"name":"Gutta-percha","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutta-percha"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Endodontic therapy","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontic_therapy"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Enterococcus faecalis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus_faecalis"},{"name":"Pan-Philippine Highway","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Philippine_Highway"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Islamic calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Cone (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry)"},{"name":"Box Hill Institute of TAFE","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Hill_Institute_of_TAFE"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Seal hunting","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_hunting"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0151736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Group 5 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_5_element"},{"name":"Windows Vista","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista"},{"name":"Maxillary central incisor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_central_incisor"},{"name":"Hypochlorite","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochlorite"}]}
