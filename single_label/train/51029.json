{"id":51029,"title":"Glycemic control mentored implementation: creating a national network of shared information.","abstract":"The Society of Hospital Medicine's (SHM's) Glycemic Control Mentored Implementation (GCMI) program, which, like all MI programs, is conducted as an improvement collaborative, is intended to help hospitals improve inpatient glycemic control in diabetic and nondiabetic patients by educating and mentoring quality teams.Hospital quality improvement (QI) teams applied for participation in GCMI from 2009 through 2012. Accepted sites were assigned either a hospitalist or endocrinologist mentor to work through the life cycle of a QI project. SHM's Implementation Guide, online resources, measurement strategies, Web-based Glycemic Control Data Center for Performance Tracking, webinars, interactive list-serve, and other tools help mentors guide these teams through the program. Mentors in GCMI bring expertise in both inpatient glycemic control and QI.One hundred fourteen hospital QI teams were enrolled into the GCMI program in the course of 2.5 years. Of these 114 sites, 90 completed the program, with 63 of them uploading data to the Data Center. Feedback from the sites was consistently positive, with the listserve, Data Center, and mentorship reported as the top three most effective components of the program. Ninety-five percent of respondents stated that they would recommend participation in an SHM-mentored implementation program to a colleague. Participants reported improved leadership skills and increased institutional support for glycemic control.Hospital quality teams participating in the GCMI program gained support to overcome barriers, focus on improving glycemic control, network with peers and expert mentor physicians, collect and analyze data, and build quality leaders. The features and structure of this program can be used in other multisite QI goals and projects.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24730206","annotations":[{"name":"Information","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Leadership","weight":0.521073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.319056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.312277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.302615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Quality management","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.149696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Mentorship","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0337886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Electronic mailing list","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Hospital medicine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_medicine"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Mentor","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentor"},{"name":"Data center","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Michigan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"},{"name":"Peer-to-peer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Uploading and downloading","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uploading_and_downloading"},{"name":"Business cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cycle"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Web conferencing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_conferencing"},{"name":"Accepted","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accepted"},{"name":"Control Data Corporation","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Data_Corporation"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Interactivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactivity"},{"name":"Rail transport in New Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_New_Zealand"}]}
