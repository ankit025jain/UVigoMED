{"id":7773,"title":"Preclinical antitumor activity of S-222611, an oral reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2.","abstract":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are validated molecular targets in cancer therapy. Dual blockade has been explored and one such agent, lapatinib, is in clinical practice but with modest activity. Through chemical screening, we discovered a novel EGFR and HER2 inhibitor, S-222611, that selectively inhibited both kinases with IC50 s below 10 nmol/L. S-222611 also inhibited intracellular kinase activity and the growth of EGFR-expressing and HER2-expressing cancer cells. In addition, S-222611 showed potent antitumor activity over lapatinib in a variety of xenograft models. In evaluations with two patient-oriented models, the intrafemoral implantation model and the intracranial implantation model, S-222611 exhibited excellent activity and could be effective against bone and brain metastasis. Compared to neratinib and afatinib, irreversible EGFR/HER2 inhibitors, S-222611 showed equivalent or slightly weaker antitumor activity but a safer profile. These results indicated that S-222611 is a potent EGFR and HER2 inhibitor with substantially better antitumor activity than lapatinib at clinically relevant doses. Considering the safer profile than for irreversible inhibitors, S-222611 could be an important option in future cancer therapy.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837299","annotations":[{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Lapatinib","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapatinib"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.87818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.858625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.760924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.674907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.580921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.555014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.547641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.522637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Brain metastasis","weight":0.313722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_metastasis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.10801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Afatinib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afatinib"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
