{"id":29510,"title":"Impact of new UK paracetamol overdose guidelines on patients presenting to the emergency department.","abstract":"Paracetamol is involved in a large proportion of overdoses that present to the Emergency Department (ED), either as lone or mixed overdoses. Non-treatment of toxic levels can lead to fulminant liver failure. This study is to determine the impact the new UK treatment guidelines will have on patients presenting with paracetamol overdose. A retrospective review was performed on all patients who had paracetamol levels done in the ED between September 2011 and August 2012. A total of 523 patients were identified, 95 (18%) of whom had detectable paracetamol levels. 74 patients from the 95 were evaluated. 18 (24%) patients were treated with N-acetylcysteine as per the then paracetamol overdose guidelines. Using the new guidelines would have resulted in 3 more patients being admitted. Our study shows that most patients who present following paracetamol overdose do not require treatment with N-acetylcysteine and suggests that the introduction of the new UK treatment guidelines is likely to result in only a small increase in the number of patients requiring treatment.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654483","annotations":[{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.608502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.598635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.548361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.520196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.280424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.248784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Fulminant","weight":0.206839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant"},{"name":"Acute liver failure","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0989837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"523","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/523"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"The Emergency (Ireland)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Treatment Guidelines from The Medical Letter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_Guidelines_from_The_Medical_Letter"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Paracetamol toxicity","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol_toxicity"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"}]}
