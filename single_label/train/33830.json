{"id":33830,"title":"Three-dimensional morphology and bony range of movement in hip joints in patients with hip dysplasia.","abstract":"To confirm whether developmental dysplasia of the hip has a risk of hip impingement, we analysed maximum ranges of movement to the point of bony impingement, and impingement location using three-dimensional (3D) surface models of the pelvis and femur in combination with 3D morphology of the hip joint using computer-assisted methods. Results of computed tomography were examined for 52 hip joints with DDH and 73 normal healthy hip joints. DDH shows larger maximum extension (p = 0.001) and internal rotation at 90Â° flexion (p < 0.001). Similar maximum flexion (p = 0.835) and external rotation (p = 0.713) were observed between groups, while high rates of extra-articular impingement were noticed in these directions in DDH (p < 0.001). Smaller cranial acetabular anteversion (p = 0.048), centre-edge angles (p < 0.001), a circumferentially shallower acetabulum, larger femoral neck anteversion (p < 0.001), and larger alpha angle were identified in DDH. Risk of anterior impingement in retroverted DDH hips is similar to that in retroverted normal hips in excessive adduction but minimal in less adduction. These findings might be borne in mind when considering the possibility of extra-articular posterior impingement in DDH being a source of pain, particularly for patients with a highly anteverted femoral neck.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788490","annotations":[{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.832051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (canine)","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(canine)"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.810453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.802204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Adduction","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduction"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.794933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (human)","weight":0.784845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(human)"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.784808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.769557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Hip joint","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_joint"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"External rotation","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_rotation"},{"name":"Internal rotation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rotation"},{"name":"Femur neck","weight":0.71219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.67333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.607163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.597426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.575507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.479743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Anteversion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anteversion"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"}]}
