{"id":87368,"title":"[Guiding role of three-column theory in manipulative reduction, small splint fixation and early rehabilitative exercises for Colles fracture].","abstract":"To explore guiding role of three-column theory in manipulative reduction, small splint fixation and early rehabilitative exercises of Colles fracture.From August 2011 to February 2012,47 patients with Colles fractures were treated by manipulative reduction small splinting fixation and early rehabilitative exercises under the guidance of three-column theory, including 21 males and 26 females aged from 40 to 76 years old with an average of (65.5 +/- 2.3). According to AO fracture classification, 27 patients were type A (including 18 cases with type A2 and 9 cases with type A3) and 20 patients were type C (including 10 cases with type C1, 6 cases with type C2 and 4 cases with type C3). Pain and recovery time of swelling, postoperative complications were observed and recorded, Gartland-Werley scoring system were applied for evaluate functional recovery and biomechanical analysis of wrist joint at 12 weeks after operation.All patients were followed up for 3 to 9 months with average of 5 months. Pain relief time ranged from 5 to 15 d with average of (7.6 +/- 2.2) d,recovery time of swelling of opisthenar was for 6 to 13 d with an average of (8.9 +/- 1.9) d. Two patients occurred tension vesicle within 3 days after operation, but no other complications occurred. According to Gartland-Werley scoring system, 25 cases got excellent results, 18 cases good and 4 cases moderate at 12 weeks after operation.Under the guidance of three-column theory, treating Colles fracture by manipulative reduction, small splinting fixation and early rehabilitative exercises can reduce pain and swelling time, promote union of fracture, effectively rehabilitate wrist function, improve clinical efficacy, and fit for concept of biomechanics.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Wounds and
