{"id":62768,"title":"Failure patterns relative to radiation treatment fields for stage II-IV thymoma.","abstract":"The optimal radiation therapy (RT) field design for thymomas remains unclear. Here we report the failure patterns in stage II-IV thymoma after RT at two tertiary referral centers, classified according to the new International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group definitions.We reviewed 156 stage II-IV patients with thymoma treated with definitive (n=24) or adjuvant (n=132) RT. All RT was delivered without elective nodal irradiation (median dose 5040 cGy). Intrathoracic failures were classified as (1) in-field failures (within 100% isodose line [IDL]), (2) marginal recurrences (<100% and ?50% IDL), and (3) out-of-field failures (outside the 50% IDL).The median follow-up was 61 months. Surgical margins were positive in 39%. The median tumor size was 9 cm. The 5-year cumulative incidence of all intrathoracic failures was 24% (n=34). Failures occurred within the RT field (n=5), marginally (n=1), out-of-field (n=22), and synchronously in- and out-of-field (n=6). The 5-year cumulative incidence of in-field failures was 7%. These were associated with Masaoka stage and tumor size. Macroscopically positive margins were associated with more local failures. Intrathoracic failures occurred most commonly in the pleural space (n=29) and lymph nodes (n=9). Patients with more advanced stage, and those treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy had more intrathoracic failures. RT dose and chemotherapy did not impact failure patterns.Although there were few in-field failures in patients who received RT for stage II-IV thymomas, a high rate of out-of-field intrathoracic failures still occurred. Further study is necessary to identify treatment approaches that prevent pleural recurrences.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518091","annotations":[{"name":"Thymoma","weight":0.897587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymoma"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.623615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.601579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.475452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.457838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.356946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Thoracic cavity","weight":0.270796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Synchronization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Infield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield"},{"name":"Failure (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_(band)"},{"name":"RT (TV network)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Autism therapies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_therapies"}]}
