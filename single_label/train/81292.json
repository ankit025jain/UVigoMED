{"id":81292,"title":"Effect of cariogenic challenge on bond strength of adhesive systems to sound and demineralized primary and permanent enamel.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of cariogenic challenge on the bond strength of adhesive systems to sound and artificially demineralized enamel of primary and permanent teeth.Eighty molars (40 primary, 40 permanent) were randomly assigned to 16 groups (n = 5) according to the type of tooth (primary [PRIM] or permanent [PERM]), enamel condition (sound [S] or demineralized [DEM]), treatment after the restorative procedure (control [C] or cariogenic challenge [pH]), and adhesive system (Adper Single Bond [SB] or Clearfil SE Bond [SE]). Teeth from the DEM group were subjected to cariogenic challenge by pH cycling prior to restorative procedures and pH group specimens were subjected to cariogenic challenge before the microshear test. One of two adhesive systems was applied to the flat enamel surfaces and composite cylinders (0.45 mm2) were built. The microshear bond test was performed. The data (MPa) were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey's test (? = 0.05).No statistically significant differences were detected between the adhesive systems. The S groups exhibited higher bond strength values than the DEM groups, as did C groups compared to pH groups. PERM groups also had higher bond strength values than PRIM groups, excluding PRIM S and PERM S, which had similar values.The bond strength to demineralized enamel of primary teeth was lower than to the demineralized enamel of permanent teeth. Cariogenic challenge negatively influenced enamel bond strength, regardless of the type of tooth and adhesive system.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25191666","annotations":[{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.707998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.694475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Pascal (unit)","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.398387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.35112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.254546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.1416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.0668393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.0381412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Shane Bond","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Bond"},{"name":"Deciduous teeth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_teeth"},{"name":"Permanent teeth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_teeth"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Cycling","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Deutsche Mark","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Mark"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Flat racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_racing"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Bond strength","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_strength"}]}
