{"id":83174,"title":"Analysis of 27 cases of large vascular lesions in 161 cases of Behcet's disease: clinical manifestations and treatment outcome.","abstract":"Very little is known about the features of Behcet's disease (BD) with vascular lesions, especially in Chinese population. This study reports the incidence, pattern, and clinical features of vascular lesions in BD patients in China. A total of 161 patients with BD were screened, and 27 patients with vessel involvement were identified. The clinical and laboratory data of the 27 BD patients with vessel involvements were retrospectively analyzed. Of 161 enrolled patients with BD, 27 had large blood vessel damage (16.77 %), with 24 males and 3 females, indicating clear prevalence in males. The average age of onset was 26.2 years old. Seven patients involved arteries only, 15 had vein damage, and 5 showed damage to both arteries and veins. Although vein lesions were more prevalent, arterial lesions were not rare (44.4 % of the vessel-affected BD patients) and could be life-threatening. All 27 patients received various treatments such as steroids, immunosuppressants, anticoagulants, and surgery, and most responded well as evidenced by resumed blood circulation and complete resolution. In conclusion, this study shows features of vessel that involved BD similar to those reported in literatures. Comprehensive treatments lead to significant improvement in BD patients.
