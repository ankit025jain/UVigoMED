{"id":17190,"title":"Primary drug resistance among pulmonary treatment-na誰ve tuberculosis patients in Amazonas State, Brazil.","abstract":"Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is the main indicator of previous treatment in tuberculosis (TB) patients. MDR-TB among treatment-na誰ve patients indicates infection with drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, and such cases are considered primary drug-resistant cases.To estimate the prevalence of drug resistance in pulmonary TB (PTB) treatment-na誰ve patients and to identify the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the resistant population.A total of 205 treatment-na誰ve PTB patients from Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil, were enrolled. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed on all positive mycobacterial cultures using the 1% proportion method.Positive M. tuberculosis cultures were obtained from only 175 patients for DST. The prevalence of primary MDR-TB was 1.7% (3/175); 14.3% (25/175) of the cultures presented resistance to at least one of the drugs. Resistance to streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol was respectively 8.6%, 6.9%, 3.4% and 2.3%. An association between TB patients with resistance to more than one drug and known previous household contact with a TB patient was observed (P= 0.008, OR 6.7, 95%CI 1.2-67.3).Although the prevalence of primary MDR-TB currently is relatively low, it may become a major public health problem if tailored treatment is not provided, as resistance to more than one drug is significantly associated with household contact.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903793","annotations":[{"name":"Isoniazid","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid"},{"name":"Rifampicin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Streptomycin","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomycin"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.709057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.705498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.614952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.596316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Ethambutol","weight":0.527951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethambutol"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.497669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.270446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Manaus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Amazonas (Brazilian state)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazonas_(Brazilian_state)"}]}
