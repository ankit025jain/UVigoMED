{"id":47411,"title":"[Short-term therapeutic effect of Endostar combined with chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis].","abstract":"To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Endostar combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of end-stage colorectal cancer.s The relevant randomized controlled trials were retrieved from the electronic databases of Cochrane library, PubMed, EMbase, CNKI, CBM, VIP and Chinese Medical Association. The retrieval time limit was from the database construction to January 2013. The data were extracted from eligible studies assessed for methodological quality according to Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews and analyzed using RevMan 5.2 software.Five randomized controlled trials involving 220 cases were included for meta-analysis. The results showed that Endostar combined with chemotherapy had an overall advantage over chemotherapy alone in terms of complete response rate (10.91% vs 2.73% RR=4.08, 95% CI: 1.19-13.95, P=0.02), partial response rate (48.18% vs 30.91% RR=2.18, 95% CI: 1.23-3.87, P=0.007), progressive disease (15.45% vs 41.82% RR=0.25, 95% CI: 0.13-0.47, P<0.0001), and the response rate (60.00% vs 33.64% RR=3.23, 95% CI: 1.79-5.81, P<0.0001). Clinical benefit response(82.73% vs 55.45% RR=4.30,95% CI:1.19-13.95, P<0.0001). The main adverse reactions included nausea, vomiting, constipation, palpitation, and electrocardiogram changes.Endostar combined with chemotherapy is effective for advanced colorectal cancer and can be used as a routine treatment.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589611","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Palpitation","weight":0.861023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpitation"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.726259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.651478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.628461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.606444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.596761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.420478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"China","weight":0.418232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.417759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.289455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.214706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
