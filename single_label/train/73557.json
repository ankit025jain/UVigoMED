{"id":73557,"title":"Diagnostic accuracy of integrated (18)F-FDG PET/CT for restaging patients with malignant germ cell tumours.","abstract":"Evaluation of utility of fluorine-18 fludeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) for restaging patients with primary malignant germ cell tumours (GCTs).Data of 92 patients (age, 31.94 Â± 10.1 years; male/female, 86/6) with histopathologically confirmed malignant GCTs (gonadal, 88; mediastinal, 4; seminomatous, 47 and non-seminomatous, 45) who underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT for restaging (suspected recurrence/post-therapy evaluation) were retrospectively analysed. Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians reviewed the PET/CT images in consensus, qualitatively and semi-quantitatively [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax)]. Histopathology (if available) and clinical/imaging/biochemical follow-up (minimum of 6 months) were employed as the reference standard.(18)F-FDG PET/CT was interpreted as positive in 59 and negative in 33 patients. Local disease was seen in 5, nodal disease in 50 and distant metastasis in 22 patients. PET/CT was true positive in 49, false positive in 10, true negative in 30 and false negative in 3 patients. (18)F-FDG PET/CT showed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 94.2%, 75.0%, 83.0%, 90.9% and 85.8% overall; 90.0%, 74.0%, 72.0%, 90.9% and 80.8% in seminomatous GCT; and 96.8%, 76.9%, 91.1%, 90.9% and 91.1% in non-seminomatous GCT, respectively. Difference in PET/CT accuracy for seminomatous and non-seminomatous GCTs was not significant (p = 0.263). PET/CT demonstrated disease in 13 patients with negative/equivocal conventional imaging findings and in 9 patients with normal tumour markers. No site- or histology-based difference was seen in SUVmax.(18)F-FDG PET/CT demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy for restaging patients with malignant GCTs. It has comparable diagnostic performance in both seminomatous and non-seminomatous malignant GCTs.The present article demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for restaging both seminomatous and non-seminomatous malignant GCTs in a large patient population.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896199","annotations":[{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Nuclear medicine","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.812614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.806677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.78463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Germ cell","weight":0.734118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"False positive","weight":0.706151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive"},{"name":"False negative","weight":0.706151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_negative"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Gonad","weight":0.581855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonad"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Fluorine","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.324922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.281082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Germinoma","weight":0.218582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germinoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Nuclear medicine physician","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine_physician"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
