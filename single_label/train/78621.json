According to their hearing level, they were divided into two groups. 14 children were in group of moderate hearing loss (41-60 dB HL). 15 children were in group of severe hearing loss (61-80 dB HL). The categories of auditory performance (CAP) and speech intelligibility rating (SIR) were used to evaluate their auditory performance and speech intelligibility. The evaluation was performed before hearing aid fitting and 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after fitting.There was significant difference in mean score of CAP between group of moderate hearing loss and severe hearing loss before hearing aid fitting (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed between these two groups at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after fitting (P > 0.05). There was also significant difference in mean score of SIR between group of moderate hearing loss and severe hearing loss before hearing aid fitting (P < 0.05). How ever, no significant differences were also observed between these two groups at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after fitting (P > 0.05). The mean scores of CAP for group of moderate hearing loss at 6, 9, 12 months after fitting were significantly superior in comparison with the score before hearing aid fitting (P < 0.05). The mean scores of SIR for group of moderate hearing loss at 6, 9, 12 months after fitting were significantly superior in comparison with the score before hearing aid fitting (P < 0.05); the mean score at 12 months after fitting was also significantly superior in comparison with the score at 1 month after fitting (P < 0.05). The mean scores of CAP for group of severe hearing loss at 3, 6, 9, 12 months after fitting were significantly superior in comparison with the score before hearing aid fitting (P < 0.05); the mean scores at 9,12 months after fitting were significantly superior in comparison with the score at 1 month after fitting (P < 0.05). The mean scores of SIR for group of severe hearing loss at 3, 6, 9, 12 months after fitting were significantly superior in comparison with the score before hearing aid fitting (P < 0.05); the mean scores at 6, 9, 12 months after fitting were also significantly superior in comparison with the score at 1 month after fitting (P < 0.05).Auditory performance and speech intelligibility in children with moderate or severe hearing loss improved significantly within the first year after hearing aid fitting. The development followed different trajectory.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616979","annotations":[{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.584424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.154468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.128014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.0617798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.0585202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Habilitation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"House of Lords","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Trajectory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
