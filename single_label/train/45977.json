{"id":45977,"title":"Novel self-assembled micelles based on palmitoyl-trimethyl-chitosan for efficient delivery of harmine to liver cancer.","abstract":"Polymeric micelles is a safe and effective delivery system, which belong to the targeted delivery system (TDS). An anticancer drug, harmine(HM) is a hydrophobic drug with much adverse effects when used for treatment of liver cancer. Chitosan (CS) is a polysaccharide and can be modified to be an amphiphilic polmer which could self-assemble into micelles and be applied for delivery of hydrophobic drugs.To synthesize three kinds of novel biodegradable polymers, designated as palmitoyl-trimethyl-CS (TPCS)1, TPCS2 and Lac-TPCS2, and investigate their efficiency and mechanism of delivery HM to liver tumors in vitro and in viro.The self-assembled micelles presented satisfactory particle size (? 200 nm) and drug release characteristics in vitro. It's proved that Lac-TPCS2/HM may enter HepG2 cell through endocytosis. Antitumor experiments in vivo revealed that Lac-TPCS2/HM could significantly inhibit tumor growth and extend the lifetime of mice bearing H22 tumors after intravenous administration. Subsequently in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging results demonstrated a satisfactory liver tumor-targeting effect of Lac-TPCS2/HM.Three novel polymers hold great potential in the development of nanomedicine for treatment of liver tumors, in particular Lac-TPCS2 exhibits the greatest antitumor potential through active target effect.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655139","annotations":[{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Amphiphile","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiphile"},{"name":"Endocytosis","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis"},{"name":"Nanomedicine","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomedicine"},{"name":"Hydrophobe","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biodegradation","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.731112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.713497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.611136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.550097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.44856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.424104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.372176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Micelle","weight":0.358667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micelle"},{"name":"Chitosan","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitosan"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.189281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Targeted drug delivery","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_drug_delivery"},{"name":"Harmine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmine"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Presidency of George W.
