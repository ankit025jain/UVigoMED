{"id":82057,"title":"Relationship between appearance of tongue carcinoma on intraoral ultrasonography and histopathologic findings.","abstract":"To clarify whether intraoral ultrasonography (I-US) is effective for predicting metastasis of tongue cancer to the cervical lymph nodes.Participants comprised 29 patients with tongue carcinoma classified as T1-T4 using the TNM staging system. All patients underwent I-US preoperatively. Postoperatively, resected specimens were evaluated histopathologically.I-US found that cases with invasive depth ?3 mm had higher potential for cervical lymph node metastasis than those with invasive depth <3 mm (P < .05). No other significant relationships were identified between observations on I-US and cervical lymph node metastasis. Cases with histopathologic blood vessel infiltration or lymph duct infiltration had a significant difference in risk of cervical lymph node metastasis.I-US is useful for preoperatively assessing the invasive depth of tongue carcinoma. Furthermore, observations from I-US and invasive depth of the tumor allowed presumptive diagnosis with regard to cervical lymph node metastasis.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725990","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.817098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.783461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cervical lymph nodes","weight":0.747833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.738828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.702375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.558606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.213079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0893031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"}]}
