{"id":62309,"title":"Thalidomide regulation of NF-?B proteins limits Tregs activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","abstract":"Thalidomide may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Since the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) causes not only malignant transformation and tumor progression, but also allows tumor cells to evade immune surveillance, NF-?B signaling components might constitute a potential target for future therapy in CLL.The current study is an attempt to characterize proteins regulated by thalidomide. Thalidomide's influence on NF-?B proteins and on regulatory T cells (Treg) in CLL was investigated.A total of 15 patients with CLL were treated with a combined thalidomide/fludarabine regimen. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. To evaluate glucocorticoid induced tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-related protein (GITR) expression in regulatory T cells, cells incubated with anti-CD3, ani-CD4 and anti-CD25 were permeabilized and then stained with anti-FOXP3 and analyzed using flow cytometry. Human TNF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels in the serum. To evaluate NF-?B activity, chemiluminescent oligonucleotide-based ELISA was performed.It was found that thalidomide regulates NF-?B activity differentially, and the activity of certain NF-?B components correlated with TNF levels and T regulatory cell (CD4 + CD25 high GITR + ).These results might indicate that thalidomide not only regulates TNF but also directly interferes with NF-?B components.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
