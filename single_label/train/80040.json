{"id":80040,"title":"[Investigation and treatment of newly discovered advanced schistosomiasis cases in Hunan Province in 2011].","abstract":"To understand the epidemiological characteristics and current status of newly confirmed advanced schistosomiasis patients in Hunan Province in 2011.The cases previously diagnosed or suspected as advanced schistosomiasis in Hunan Province were the subjects of this investigation. Questionnairing (demographical information, disease history, etc.), clinical examination (ascites syndrome, abdominal palpation), laboratory examination, and abdominal ultrasonography were used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment was given to the patients.In 2011, there were 620 newly discovered advanced schistosomiasis patients in Hunan Province, mainly distributed in Yueyang (300 cases, 48.4%), Changde (193 cases, 31.1%) and Yiyang (123 cases, 19.8%). The male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1. The average age of the patients was 60.4 +/- 12.4. 69.7% (432/620) of the patients were illiterate or with primary school education. 90.3% (560/620) of them were farmers. 162 (26.1%) cases were labour incapacity and 442 cases (71.3%) were with a weak labor ability before receiving medical treatment. The average time from discovery of schistosome infection to diagnosis of advanced schistosomiasis was (24.9 +/- 14.3) years. Among the 620 patients, 418 cases were with ascites (67.4%), 201 cases with splenomegaly (32.4%), and 1 case with multiple granuloma in the colon (0.2%). 172 cases (27.7%) were with visible abdominal vein, 144 cases (23.2%) with a hard liver texture, and 3.4% (21/620) cases with a hard spleen texture. Abdominal ultrasonography showed that 59.4% (368/620) of the patients were with grade III hepatic fibrosis. 577 cases (93.1%) received medical treatments and 43 cases (6.9%) received surgical treatment. After the treatment, the clinical symptoms and signs of 410 cases (66.1%) were improved and 210 cases (33.9%) needed further treatment.Newly confirmed advanced schistosomiasis patients in Hunan Province are mostly distributed in historically endemic areas, mainly middle-aged and older farmers, and generally in poor health when diagnosed.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818385","annotations":[{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Splenomegaly","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.706275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.608558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.596675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.351621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.348835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.271491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.232234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.182633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"History","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Hunan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan"},{"name":"Literacy","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Capacity (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_(law)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"}]}
