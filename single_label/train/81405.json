{"id":81405,"title":"Treatment of oral ulcers in dogs using adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells.","abstract":"Adipose tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stem cells (ADMSCs) represent a promising toolfor new clinical concepts in supporting cellular therapy. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of ADMSCs transplantation on oral ulcer healing in dogs.Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from adipose tissues of dogs obtained by suction-assisted lipectomy (liposuction), by dish adherence and were expanded in culture. Oral ulcers were induced by topical application of formocresol in the oral cavity of 18 dogs. The dogs were classified into 3 groups. Either autologous ADMSCs, Corticosteriod (Dexamethasone) or vehicle (saline) was injected. The healing process of the ulcer was monitored histopathologically. Gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelets derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and collagen was assessed in biopsies obtained from all ulcers \"as healing markers'\", by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).ADMSCs group showed significantly accelerated oral ulcer healing compared with the Dexamethasone and control groups. There was increased expression of VEGF PDGF EGF and collagen genes in ADMSCs-treated ulcers compared with Dexamethasone and controls.ADMSCs transplantation may help accelerate oral ulcer healing, possibly through the induction of angiogenesis by VEGF and PDGF as well as epithelial and connective tissue proliferation as evidenced by increased EGF and collagen gene expression.","date":"2014-08-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25095315","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain
