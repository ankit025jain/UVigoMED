{"id":80083,"title":"PCR and microscopic identification of isolated Leishmania tropica from clinical samples of cutaneous leishmaniasis in human population of Kohat region in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.","abstract":"Leishmania tropica was isolated from the clinical patients of cutaneous leishmaniasis in rural community of Kohat district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and was identified through PCR, microscopy, and culture techniques. A total of 113 samples from the clinical patients were examined through PCR, microscopy, and culture which showed 87.61% (99/113), 53.98% (61/113), and 46.90% (53/113) prevalence. During the study, 186?bp Leishmania tropica was identified through PCR. Thus the sensitivity of PCR is very high as compared to the conventional techniques.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804255","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.65199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.299762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.146135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"World population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Leishmania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania"},{"name":"Kohat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohat"},{"name":"Cutaneous leishmaniasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Leishmania tropica","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania_tropica"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Sampling bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Envelope detector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_detector"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Community (Armenia)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(Armenia)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"}]}
