{"id":83397,"title":"Ubiquitination in disease pathogenesis and treatment.","abstract":"Ubiquitination is crucial for a plethora of physiological processes, including cell survival and differentiation and innate and adaptive immunity. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of the molecular action of ubiquitin in signaling pathways and how alterations in the ubiquitin system lead to the development of distinct human diseases. Here we describe the role of ubiquitination in the onset and progression of cancer, metabolic syndromes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmunity, inflammatory disorders, infection and muscle dystrophies. Moreover, we indicate how current knowledge could be exploited for the development of new clinical therapies.
