{"id":26360,"title":"Mitochondrial depolarization and electrophysiological changes during ischemia in the rabbit and human heart.","abstract":"Instability of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (??m) has been implicated in electrical dysfunction, including arrhythmogenesis during ischemia-reperfusion. Monitoring ??m has led to conflicting results, where depolarization has been reported as sporadic and as a propagating wave. The present study was designed to resolve the aforementioned difference and determine the unknown relationship between ??m and electrophysiology. We developed a novel imaging modality for simultaneous optical mapping of ??m and transmembrane potential (Vm). Optical mapping was performed using potentiometric dyes on preparations from 4 mouse hearts, 14 rabbit hearts, and 7 human hearts. Our data showed that during ischemia, ??m depolarization is sporadic and changes asynchronously with electrophysiological changes. Spatially, ??m depolarization was associated with action potential duration shortening but not conduction slowing. Analysis of focal activity indicated that ??m is not different within the myocardium where the focus originates compared with normal ventricular tissue. Overall, our data suggest that during ischemia, mitochondria maintain their function at the expense of sarcolemmal electrophysiology, but ??m depolarization does not have a direct association to ischemia-induced arrhythmias.
