{"id":63922,"title":"Diagnostic yield of fine needle aspiration biopsy in HIV-infected adults with suspected mycobacterial lymphadenitis.","abstract":"Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) has been shown to be the diagnostic procedure of choice for superficial lymphadenitis in tuberculosis endemic regions.We conducted a retrospective laboratory-based study to determine the bacteriological yield of clinically suspected mycobacterial tuberculous lymphadenitis following FNAB in adults, and specifically HIV-positive patients, to determine the need for the introduction of automated nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) such as the Xpert MTB/RIF assay as the initial diagnostic modality. RESULTS. A diagnostic yield of 80% was achieved, significantly higher in HIV-positive v. HIV-negative patients (84% v. 52%, respectively; p<0.001).The results justify using automated NAATs such as the Xpert MTB/RIF assay as the initial diagnostic modality to expedite management in HIV-infected patients.","date":"2014-01-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24388082","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Nucleic acid","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.563904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Bacteriology","weight":0.276462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriology"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.273935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.226923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.107094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"}]}
