{"id":19538,"title":"Same day sputum smear microscopy approach with modified ZN staining for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in a microscopy centre at Rajahmundry.","abstract":"Sputum smear microscopy is the main-stay in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in many developing countries. To overcome the drop outs, same day diagnosis is ideal.In the current study, two spot sputum samples (SS 2 approach) are collected within a gap of one hour (same day sputum smear microscopy) in addition to the standard spot morning (SM) approach. The smears were stained with standard Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) and modified ZN staining techniques.Out of 1537 patients, sputum smear positivity (SSP) was 9.43% (146 patients) in SM approach with standard ZN staining. Smear positivity was increased to 9.8% (151 patients) with modified ZN staining. For SS 2 approach, SSP was 9.37% (144 patients) and 9.8% (151 patients) with standard and modified ZN staining procedures, respectively.Diagnosis of lung tuberculosis is possible with two spot sputum samples with modified ZN staining.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713901","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.726325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.570335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.445403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.428167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.262612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Rajahmundry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajahmundry"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Schutzstaffel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1537","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1537"},{"name":"Shark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark"},{"name":"Smear campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign"},{"name":"Out (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Scott Ziehl","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Ziehl"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Master of Science","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Dropping out","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropping_out"},{"name":"Sputum culture","weight":0.0107573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum_culture"}]}
