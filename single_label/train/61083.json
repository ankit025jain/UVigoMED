{"id":61083,"title":"Mantle cell lymphoma epidemiology: a population-based study in France.","abstract":"Only limited population-based data are available on mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a relatively rare and aggressive mature B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) entity. We conducted an epidemiological study based on the three French registries devoted to haematological malignancies over the period 2002-2006. Main clinical features and management characteristics were collected. Incidence and survival rates were estimated, and independent prognostic factors were analysed. MCL was diagnosed in 135 patients between 2002 and 2006. Seventy-four percent of patients were men. Age-standardised incidence rate of MCL (per 100,000) was 1.1 in men and 0.26 in women. Median age at diagnosis was 72 years (range 30-92). Advanced-stage (III or IV) disease was diagnosed in 81.5 % of patients, and 55 % of them were identified as high risk according to MCL International Prognostic Index (MIPI). Median net survival time was 41 months (95 % confidence interval (CI), 38-62). Main independent prognostic factors were age at diagnosis, performance status and use of rituximab in first-line treatment. Median overall survival was 36 months (95 % CI, 27-40) for high MIPI and 60 months (95 % CI, 35-74) for low/intermediate MIPI patients (p = 0.02). This study confirms that MCL remains an aggressive NHL with a median overall survival less than 4 years and demonstrates that the use of rituximab has modified overall survival duration.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763513","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"France","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.737674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.731313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.725719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.716628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.567823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.547152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.533829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.453863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.373667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.355227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"National Hockey League","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League"},{"name":"Mantle cell lymphoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
