{"id":46603,"title":"KLF5 regulates the integrity and oncogenicity of intestinal stem cells.","abstract":"The intestinal epithelium maintains homeostasis by a self-renewal process involving resident stem cells, including Lgr5(+) crypt-base columnar cells, but core mechanisms and their contributions to intestinal cancer are not fully defined. In this study, we examined a hypothesized role for KLF5, a zinc-finger transcription factor that is critical to maintain the integrity of embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, in intestinal stem-cell integrity and cancer in the mouse. Klf5 was indispensable for the integrity and oncogenic transformation of intestinal stem cells. In mice, inducible deletion of Klf5 in Lgr5(+) stem cells suppressed their proliferation and survival in a manner associated with nuclear localization of ?-catenin (Catnb), generating abnormal apoptotic cells in intestinal crypts. Moreover, production of lethal adenomas and carcinomas by specific expression of an oncogenic mutant of ?-catenin in Lgr5(+) stem cells was suppressed completely by Klf5 deletion in the same cells. Given that activation of the Wnt/?-catenin pathway is the most frequently altered pathway in human colorectal cancer, our results argue that KLF5 acts as a fundamental core regulator of intestinal oncogenesis at the stem-cell level, and they suggest KLF5 targeting as a rational strategy to eradicate stem-like cells in colorectal cancer.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626089","annotations":[{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Pluripotent","weight":0.79421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluripotent"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Induced pluripotent stem cell","weight":0.74952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.70252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.675831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.636922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.632094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.605583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.601573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.503836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.485739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.382926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.260167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0949986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Nuclear localization signal","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_localization_signal"},{"name":"Intestinal epithelium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_epithelium"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Columnar epithelial cell","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnar_epithelial_cell"}]}
