{"id":10264,"title":"Accumulation of oligomer-prone ?-synuclein exacerbates synaptic and neuronal degeneration in vivo.","abstract":"In Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, ?-synuclein aggregates to form oligomers and fibrils; however, the precise nature of the toxic ?-synuclein species remains unclear. A number of synthetic ?-synuclein mutations were recently created (E57K and E35K) that produce species of ?-synuclein that preferentially form oligomers and increase ?-synuclein-mediated toxicity. We have shown that acute lentiviral expression of ?-synuclein E57K leads to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons; however, the effects of chronic expression of oligomer-prone ?-synuclein in synapses throughout the brain have not been investigated. Such a study could provide insight into the possible mechanism(s) through which accumulation of ?-synuclein oligomers in the synapse leads to neurodegeneration. For this purpose, we compared the patterns of neurodegeneration and synaptic damage between a newly generated mThy-1 ?-synuclein E57K transgenic mouse model that is prone to forming oligomers and the mThy-1 ?-synuclein wild-type mouse model (Line 61), which accumulates various forms of ?-synuclein. Three lines of ?-synuclein E57K (Lines 9, 16 and 54) were generated and compared with the wild-type. The ?-synuclein E57K Lines 9 and 16 were higher expressings of ?-synuclein, similar to ?-synuclein wild-type Line 61, and Line 54 was a low expressing of ?-synuclein compared to Line 61. By immunoblot analysis, the higher-expressing ?-synuclein E57K transgenic mice showed abundant oligomeric, but not fibrillar, ?-synuclein whereas lower-expressing mice accumulated monomeric ?-synuclein. Monomers, oligomers, and fibrils were present in ?-synuclein wild-type Line 61. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses demonstrated that ?-synuclein accumulated in the synapses but not in the neuronal cells bodies, which was different from the ?-synuclein wild-type Line 61, which accumulates ?-synuclein in the soma. Compared to non-transgenic and lower-expressing mice, the higher-expressing ?-synuclein E57K mice displayed synaptic and dendritic loss, reduced levels of synapsin 1 and synaptic vesicles, and behavioural deficits. Similar alterations, but to a lesser extent, were seen in the ?-synuclein wild-type mice. Moreover, although the oligomer-prone ?-synuclein mice displayed neurodegeneration in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, the ?-synuclein wild-type only displayed neuronal loss in the hippocampus. These results support the hypothesis that accumulating oligomeric ?-synuclein may mediate early synaptic pathology in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies by disrupting synaptic vesicles. This oligomer-prone model might be useful for evaluating therapies directed at oligomer reduction.
