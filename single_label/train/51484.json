{"id":51484,"title":"Genetically engineered mouse models for epithelial ovarian cancer: are we there yet?","abstract":"The development of preclinical spontaneous genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) requires an understanding of the genetic basis of the human disease. Such robust models have proven invaluable for increasing understanding of human malignancies as well as identifying new biomarkers and testing new therapies for these diseases. While GEMMs have been reported for ovarian cancer, the majority have proven disappointing overall in their recapitulation of paired genetic and histological features especially for serous ovarian epithelial cancer. This review describes GEMMs for ovarian cancer, in particular, high grade serous ovarian cancer and assesses these in light of recent changes in our understanding of the human malignancy.
