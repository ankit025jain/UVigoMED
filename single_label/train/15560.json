{"id":15560,"title":"Comparison between azithromycin and cefixime in the treatment of typhoid fever in children.","abstract":"An intervention study was carried out in the department of paediatrics of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh to compare the clinical efficacy of Azithromycin in the treatment of childhood typhoid fever with that of cefixime for a period of one year from January 2011 to December 2011. A total of 60 cases of typhoid fever were enrolled in to a randomized clinical trial and was divided into two groups. The inclusion criteria of the cases were: Documented fever for more than 4 days plus two or more of the following clinical features: toxic physical appearance, intestinal complaints, coated tongue, ceacal gurgling, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, diarrhoea and constipation plus positive Widal test and/or blood culture positivity. Patients who had complication like GIT heamorrhage; intestinal perforaion and/or shock were excluded from the study. Data were collected in a structured questionnaire. Azithromycin was given at a dose of 10mg/kg/day for a period of 07 days Cefixime was given at a dose of 20mg/kg/day in two divided dose for 14 days. The mean time of defervesence was 4.05+1.14 days with azithromycin and 3.41+0.95 with cefixime respectively. The minimum defervesence time was 02 days and maximum defervesence time was 07 days. Clinical cure rate was 87% in azithromycin group and 93% in cefixime group. No serious adverse effect was noted related to azithromycin and cefixime therapy except nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and jaundice. It was found that azithromycin is almost as effective as cefixime in the treatment of typhoid fever.
