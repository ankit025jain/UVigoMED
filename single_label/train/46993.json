{"id":46993,"title":"Effect of hepatitis B virus reverse transcriptase variations on entecavir treatment response.","abstract":"Entecavir therapy often reduces hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA to an undetectable level, but HBV DNA remain detectable in some patients. We investigated whether baseline HBV reverse transcriptase (rt) polymorphism and quasispecies complexity and diversity were associated with treatment response.Pretreatment HBV DNA levels, HBV rt sequence, serology, and quasispecies complexity and diversity from 305 entecavir-treated patients were determined. These data were tested for their association with year 1 virological outcome, defined by optimal response (undetectable HBV DNA; lower limit of detection, ?12 IU/mL) or partial response (detectable HBV DNA).Four rt variants were more frequently detected in the 64 partial responders than in the 241 optimal responders (all P < .05). Multivariate analysis revealed that high baseline HBV DNA level (P < .0001; odds ratio [OR], 2.32), HBV e antigen (HBeAg) positivity (P < .001; OR, 3.70), and rt124N (P = .002; OR, 3.06) were associated with a partial entecavir response. Compared with the optimal responders, the partial responders had a lower quasispecies complexity and diversity.Apart from the known factors (high baseline HBV DNA level and HBeAg positivity), a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (rt124N) and lower quasispecies complexity and diversity were associated with partial entecavir response at year 1.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610871","annotations":[{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.950911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.751375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.728682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.728618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.640689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.504881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.458796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Reverse transcriptase","weight":0.366152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase"},{"name":"Quasispecies model","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasispecies_model"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.284575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.106006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Entecavir","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entecavir"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Computational complexity theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1"},{"name":"305","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/305"},{"name":"241","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/241"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"California State Route 241","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_241"}]}
