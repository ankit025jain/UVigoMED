{"id":12186,"title":"Local immunostimulation leading to rejection of accepted male skin grafts by female mice as a model for cancer immunotherapy.","abstract":"Female mice of inbred strain CBA do not reject syngeneic male skin grafts even though they mount a T-cell response against the male-specific HY antigen. We show that local immunostimulation performed by injecting cytokines and Toll-like receptor ligands in close vicinity to the graft causes rejection. We feel that this approach should be tested in tumor-bearing human patients in combination with antitumor vaccination. Relief of intratumor immunosuppression may increase considerably the fraction of patients who respond to vaccination directed against tumor antigens recognized by T cells.
