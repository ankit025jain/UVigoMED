{"id":28031,"title":"[Prophylaxis of substance abuse in the Armed Forces: organization and performance of screening. Problem of substance dependence disorders is the actual for many countries in the world and affects on health of servicemen].","abstract":"Due to this fact specialists underline the necessity of implementation of constant drug testing system of servicemen. The most effective researches individuals suffering from substance abuse are sample and control survey. Promising areas of prevention of addictive disease include the use of modem technologies for early detection of drug narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, using the psychophysiological and laboratory techniques. The most common rapid laboratory procedure is the use of test strips (tablets) based immunoassay analysis. To facilitate the evaluation of the results is increasingly incorporated hardware and software systems based on photometric detection. The work done on the testing of such complexes allowed us to determine the algorithm of screening soldiers to assess the effectiveness of various hardware and software systems and identify promising technologies to identify individuals with addictive disorders.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25046929","annotations":[{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Narcotic","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Psychoactive drug","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.705716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.6537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.593607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.482581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.323482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.282573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Psychophysiology","weight":0.276288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysiology"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.269635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.235792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.233668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.231548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Soldier","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hardware","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"United States Armed Forces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
