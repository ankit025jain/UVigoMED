{"id":50302,"title":"Diabetes Attitude Scale: validation in type-2 diabetes patients in multiple centers in China.","abstract":"The aim of the paper is to report the development and psychometric testing of Diabetes Attitude Scale.A prospective study was performed. The cultural equivalency and content validity of the Diabetes Attitude Scale were determined by panels of endocrinologists, physiologists, nurses and dieticians. An accurate and usable translation was obtained for each of five subscales examining attitudes on need for special training, the seriousness of type-2 diabetes, the need for controlling the condition, its psychosocial impact and the degree of autonomy given to patients in decision making. The validation was derived from 5961 patients with type-2 diabetes, recruited from 50 centers in 29 provinces throughout China between March 1st and September 30th, 2010.The modified Diabetes Attitude Scale showed an acceptable level of internal consistency. The strength of the inter-correlations among the domains of five subscales suggests that the instrument measures related but separate domains of patients' attitudes toward diabetes. Moreover, the test-retest intraclass correlation coefficients were high enough to support the stability of the Chinese version of the third version of the scale.The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of Diabetes Attitude Scale demonstrated satisfactory validity and reliability and appeared to effectively evaluate attitudes toward diabetes in patients with type-2 diabetes.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802805","annotations":[{"name":"China","weight":0.671736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.572164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.540243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.535402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.436631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.417276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.388822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.357338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.311544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.297409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Chinese language","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language"},{"name":"Autonomy","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy"},{"name":"Dietitian","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0650786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Statistical Methods for Research Workers","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_Methods_for_Research_Workers"},{"name":"Content validity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_validity"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"March 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1"},{"name":"September 30","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_30"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_the_Ottoman_Empire"},{"name":"Scale (map)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map)"},{"name":"Cranford (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranford_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Measuring instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_instrument"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Computer security","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
