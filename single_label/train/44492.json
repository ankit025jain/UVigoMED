{"id":44492,"title":"Effect of fluvastatin on 24-week telaprevir-based combination therapy for hepatitis C virus genotype 1b-infected chronic hepatitis C.","abstract":"The addition of fluvastatin significantly improves sustained virological response (SVR) in pegylated interferon and ribavirin (peg-IFN/RBV) combination therapy for patients infected with the hepatitis C virus. However, the add-on effect on telaprevir-based triple combination therapy remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fluvastatin on telaprevir-based combination therapy by conducting a prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled trial.Among 124 genotype 1b-infected chronic hepatitis C patients recruited, 116 eligible patients were allocated randomly to two study arms; they received 12 weeks of telaprevir/peg-IFN/RBV, followed by 12 weeks of peg-IFN/RBV with or without 24 weeks of fluvastatin (fluvastatin group and control group, respectively). Treatment outcomes and adverse effects were compared between the two groups.There were 56 men and 60 women, median age 60 years (range, 28-71 years). Rapid virological response and end of treatment response rates were 87.9% (51/58) and 96.6% (56/58) in the control group and 75.9% (44/58) and 98.3% (57/58) in the fluvastatin group, respectively. SVR rates in the control group and the fluvastatin group were 84.5% (49/58) and 81.0% (47/58), respectively; there was no significant difference (P=0.806). Stratified analysis showed that no factors associated with the SVR rate were found between the two groups. No adverse events were associated with fluvastatin.In this trial, administration of fluvastatin with telaprevir/peg-IFN/RBV was a safe combination. However, fluvastatin had no add-on effect on 24-week telaprevir-based combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b-infected patients.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732752","annotations":[{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.926361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.818972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.813043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.759401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.746087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.204946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)"},{"name":"Fluvastatin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluvastatin"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Plug-in (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)"},{"name":"806","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/806"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Triple (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Coat of arms","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"}]}
