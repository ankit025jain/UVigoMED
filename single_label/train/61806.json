{"id":61806,"title":"Adoptive therapy with chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells of defined subset composition.","abstract":"The ability to engineer T cells to recognize tumor cells through genetic modification with a synthetic chimeric antigen receptor has ushered in a new era in cancer immunotherapy. The most advanced clinical applications are in targeting CD19 on B-cell malignancies. The clinical trials of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor therapy have thus far not attempted to select defined subsets before transduction or imposed uniformity of the CD4 and CD8 cell composition of the cell products. This review will discuss the rationale for and challenges to using adoptive therapy with genetically modified T cells of defined subset and phenotypic composition.
