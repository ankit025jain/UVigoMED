{"id":63750,"title":"[Screening for autoimmune polyglandular syndrome in a cohort of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus].","abstract":"To characterize a cohort of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) on the presence of other autoimmune disorders that could establish the diagnosis of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS).We included 151 patients with T1DM. The following clinical parameters were analyzed: gender, current age, disease duration, previous history of autoimmune disorders, and familial history for diabetes mellitus. Each patient was analyzed to detect autoimmune markers of thyroiditis, adrenocortical insufficiency, gastritis, and celiac disease, as well as possible associated dysfunctions.A cohort with 51.7% males, average current age of 33.4 ± 13 years and disease duration of 14.4 ± 9.6 years was analyzed. Previous history of autoimmunity was found in 2%, and familial history for diabetes mellitus in 31.1% of the cohort. Frequency of autoimmune markers was 24% for thyroiditis, 9.4% for adrenocortical insufficiency, 17.2% for gastritis, and 2% for celiac disease. APS was diagnosed on 25.2% of the patients. APS and autoimmune thyroiditis risk was higher in females. Disease duration correlated directly with gastric autoantibodies, and inversely with positive islet cell, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and tyrosine phosphatase antibodies. We noticed a correlation between autoimmune markers for thyroiditis and gastritis, as well as between celiac disease and adrenocortical insufficiency.Considering APS prevalence and prognosis, the need for APS screening in patients with T1DM is emphasized. Early diagnosis of other autoimmune disorders will enable us to adjust each patient treatment and follow-up.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24402020","annotations":[{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.823761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Glutamate decarboxylase","weight":0.821218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_decarboxylase"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.729746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.717328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.683731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.62819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.608558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Adrenal cortex","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_cortex"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.537436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.529997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.508618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.487333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Adrenal insufficiency","weight":0.318945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_insufficiency"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.307409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Thyroiditis","weight":0.285148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroiditis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.113019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Autoimmune thyroiditis","weight":0.0915594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_thyroiditis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Protein tyrosine phosphatase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_tyrosine_phosphatase"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
