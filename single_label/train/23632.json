{"id":23632,"title":"Association of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio with presence and severity of gastritis due to Helicobacter pylori infection.","abstract":"Infection with the bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori (HP) clearly results in chronic mucosal inflammation in the stomach and duodenum, which, in turn, might lead to abnormalities in gastroduodenal motility and sensitivity and is the most frequent cause of dyspepsia and peptic disease. Some studies have shown that there was a correlation between low-grade inflammation as C-reactive protein (CRP) and HP infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the presence of gastritis due to HP infection and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple and reliable indicator of inflammation.Fifty patients met the HP criteria and half of them have had severe symptoms and upper endoscopy showed atrophic gastritis, and fifty age- and sex-matched control subjects with gastritis without HP infection were included in this randomized controlled trial. Patients were diagnosed to have HP according to the use of urea breath testing (UBT) and multiple biopsies. NLR was calculated from complete blood count at the time of diagnosis and before initiating the treatment to all groups.Patients with HP infection had significantly higher NLR compared to those without HP. Moreover, the patients with symptomatic HP and grade 4 gastritis had higher NLR than those asymptomatic with past history of peptic disease (P 0.007 and P 0.068, respectively). Although NLR increased as the severity of gastritis and HP symptoms increased (r = 0.564, P < 0.001), Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve analysis was performed. The cut-off level for NLR with optimal sensitivity and specificity was calculated as 1.82 (area under curve [AUC] = 0.825 [0.753-0.884], P < 0.001).The present study indicated, for the first time, a significant correlation between HP infection and inflammation on the basis of NLR, a simple and reliable indicator of inflammation. Furthermore, there is an increase in NLR as the severity of gastritis with HP increases. This elevated ratio gets normalized with treatment.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478129","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Dyspepsia","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspepsia"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.880394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.872586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.85059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.509846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Atrophic gastritis","weight":0.383604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophic_gastritis"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.328331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.204247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.173734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"}]}
