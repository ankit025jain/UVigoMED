{"id":76218,"title":"Evaluation of the South Dakota fitCare child care provider training program targeting nutrition and physical activity.","abstract":"Early childhood obesity is a significant health problem that has serious short- and long-term consequences. Recognizing the influence child care providers have on children, state programs have been created through federal funding initiatives to improve childhood health and reduce obesity rates. In 2011, South Dakota Department of Health received a five-year Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Community Transformation grant to improve healthy eating and active living. Grant funds were used to implement the fitCare Child Care Provider Training Program.Child care providers in South Dakota volunteered to participate in fitCare training. Surveys were conducted among fitCare and non-fitCare participants to assess South Dakota child care provider implementation of proper nutrition and physical activities in child care settings.Survey findings showed that 52 percent of all providers surveyed have children, newborn to 2 years old, at their day care for more than 40 hours per week. Non-fitCare providers were more likely to provide additional servings of fruit than fitCare providers. Statistically significant findings showed that fitCare providers were more likely than non-fitCare providers to offer structured physical activity (p = < 0.001). Rural Urban Commuting Area analysis was also performed showing differences between rural and urban areas.Conclusions suggest that the physical activity components of fitCare training have a stronger impact on providers than the nutrition components. Future research should focus on strengthening the nutrition component of fitCare as well as increasing access to healthy foods. Suggestions are offered for improving the fitCare curriculum and training.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163224","annotations":[{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.650458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Day care","weight":0.575428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_care"},{"name":"Childhood obesity","weight":0.551267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_obesity"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.461506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Child care","weight":0.395364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_care"},{"name":"Grant (money)","weight":0.338421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_(money)"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Federal government of the United States","weight":0.218537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Commuting","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.154529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Curriculum","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0886576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Human nutrition","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nutrition"},{"name":"Early childhood education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood_education"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Administration of federal assistance in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_federal_assistance_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Health department","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_department"},{"name":"Active Living","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Living"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
