{"id":22879,"title":"Pitfalls in imaging of musculoskeletal infections.","abstract":"In musculoskeletal infections, imaging helps in the diagnosis and identification of disease extent. Musculoskeletal infections have variable clinical presentations related to host immune responses and virulence of pathogens. Occasionally, infectious process may mimic other entities such as autoimmune inflammatory diseases, tumors, or traumatic injuries, both clinically and radiologically. Identification of the disease extent is sometimes difficult, particularly when infection occurs in the damaged tissue. The key imaging feature of infection is formation of abscesses. Familiarity of the imaging patterns of the infectious process leads to correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
