{"id":63936,"title":"[Effects of different doses of iron supplement on function of mitochondrial respiration of liver during exercise-induced hypochromic rats].","abstract":"To investigate the effects of iron supplement on function of mitochondrial respiratory of liver during exercise-induced hypochromic rats.Forty healthy male Wistar rats were randomized into 5 groups (n = 8): static control (C), exercise-training (T), training with supplementation of small dose iron (S + T), training with supplementation of middle dose iron (M + T) and training with supplementation of large dose iron (L + T). Training performed incremental exercise for 8 weeks, 6 days/week, iron supplementation from the fifth week. Liver were prepared immediately after exhaustive running. Liver mitochondria were extracted by differential centrifugation. Spectrophotometric analysis was used to evaluate activities of electron transport chain complex (C) I-IV in liver mitochondria.(1) C I, CII and CIV activities in T group were increased significantly (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), CI - C IV activities in S + T, M + T and L + T groups were increased significantly (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) compared with those in C group. (2) CII activity in S + T group was increased remarkably (P < 0.05); CIII and CIV activities in M + T group were increased remarkably (P < 0.01); CI - CIV activities in L+ T group were increased remarkably (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) compared with those in T group.Large load exercise training composite iron supplementation can improve function of mitochondrial respiration of liver and the aerobic capacity. From the athletic ability , the middle dose iron supplementation is better during large load exercise training.","date":"2014-01-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24386824","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Electron transport chain","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_transport_chain"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Centrifugation","weight":0.728218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugation"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.636534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Respiration (physiology)","weight":0.544367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)"},{"name":"Aerobic organism","weight":0.429587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.355984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.341581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.155676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"VO2 max","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Chain complex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_complex"},{"name":"Differential centrifugation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_centrifugation"},{"name":"CIV (band)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIV_(band)"},{"name":"CIII-TV","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIII-TV"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_corpuscular_hemoglobin_concentration"},{"name":"Iron supplements","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_supplements"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Electrostatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
