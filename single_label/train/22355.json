{"id":22355,"title":"Epidemiology of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant community-acquired Enterobacteria isolated from elderly patients.","abstract":"This survey was made to study the epidemiology of multiresistant bacteria (MRB) in the French community, among elderly patients 65 years of age or more, carrying third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GC-resistant) Enterobacteriaceae, and the co-resistance of prescribed antibiotics.The data was collected in 2009 in the West of France by MedQual, a network of 174 private laboratories.Two thousand one hundred and sixty strains of the 88,255 identified Enterobacteria strains were 3GC-resistant (2.4%) and 945 of these strains (41.8%) were isolated from elderly patients 65 years of age or more. Escherichia coli was the predominant 3GC-resistant strain (72.7%). 51.4% of the 945 patients in whom a 3GC-resistant strain was isolated produced an extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL). The main risk factors for infection with the 3GC-resistant strain were hospitalization and antibiotic treatment in the previous year (58.2 and 86.9%, respectively). Hospitalization during the previous year was more frequent among elderly patients who lived at home compared with those who lived in nursing homes (P<0.05). The production of ESBL, among the 945 patients who carried the 3GC-resistant strains, was similar among patients who lived at home compared with those who lived in nursing homes (51.4% versus 49.7%).Microbiologists should warn family physicians about MRB isolates with a specific antimicrobial resistance pattern (3GC-resistant, fluoroquinolone-resistant, etc.) to prescribe more effective medications.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556454","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"France","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.746182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.736231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.58717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.475432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Microbiologist","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiologist"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.259539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.109465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"French language","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Private sector","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"}]}
