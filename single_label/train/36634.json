{"id":36634,"title":"Investigations of the Nav?1b sodium channel subunit in human ventricle; functional characterization of the H162P Brugada syndrome mutant.","abstract":"Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a rare inherited disease that can give rise to ventricular arrhythmia and ultimately sudden cardiac death. Numerous loss-of-function mutations in the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 have been associated with BrS. However, few mutations in the auxiliary Nav?1-4 subunits have been linked to this disease. Here we investigated differences in expression and function between Nav?1 and Nav?1b and whether the H162P/Nav?1b mutation found in a BrS patient is likely to be the underlying cause of disease. The impact of Nav? subunits was investigated by patch-clamp electrophysiology, and the obtained in vitro values were used for subsequent in silico modeling. We found that Nav?1b transcripts were expressed at higher levels than Nav?1 transcripts in the human heart. Nav?1 and Nav?1b coexpressed with Nav1.5 induced a negative shift on steady state of activation and inactivation compared with Nav1.5 alone. Furthermore, Nav?1b was found to increase the current level when coexpressed with Nav1.5, Nav?1b/H162P mutated subunit peak current density was reduced by 48% (-645 ± 151 vs. -334 ± 71 pA/pF), V1/2 steady-state inactivation shifted by -6.7 mV (-70.3 ± 1.5 vs. -77.0 ± 2.8 mV), and time-dependent recovery from inactivation slowed by >50% compared with coexpression with Nav?1b wild type. Computer simulations revealed that these electrophysiological changes resulted in a reduction in both action potential amplitude and maximum upstroke velocity. The experimental data thereby indicate that Nav?1b/H162P results in reduced sodium channel activity functionally affecting the ventricular action potential. This result is an important replication to support the notion that BrS can be linked to the function of Nav?1b and is associated with loss-of-function of the cardiac sodium channel.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
