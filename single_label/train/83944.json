{"id":83944,"title":"Hair transplantation in the surgical treatment of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia.","abstract":"Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is a progressive primary scarring alopecia that occurs mainly on the vertex of the scalp and expands centrifugally. To date, there is a paucity of published prospective studies reporting successful surgical therapy for CCCA.To evaluate the efficacy of hair transplantation using the round (punch) grafting technique in African American women with CCCA.We describe 2 African American female patients with CCCA who had endured nearly 5 to 6 years of progressive hair loss on the crown of the scalp. After a scalp biopsy and hair transplant test session, both patients underwent hair transplantation with the use of round grafts. Digital photographs were obtained before and after hair transplantation to determine the hair growth success and response rates.Hair growth was visibly observed at the recipient sites in both patients beginning between 4 to 5 months post-test session. No postoperative scarring in the recipient or donor areas of the scalp were noted in either patient.Hair transplantation is a safe well-tolerated procedure to improve hair loss in African American women with end-stage CCCA who histologically display a lack of inflammation on scalp biopsy.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25207763","annotations":[{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Hair transplantation","weight":0.634378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_transplantation"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.595276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.580537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Scalp","weight":0.528324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.503277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.310572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.235103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Cicatricial alopecia","weight":0.208226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicatricial_alopecia"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Hirsutism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsutism"},{"name":"Centrifuge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifuge"},{"name":"Vertex (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(anatomy)"}]}
