{"id":12663,"title":"Androgens and stroke: good, bad or indifferent?","abstract":"Cerebral ischemia caused by loss of blood supply to the brain during cardiac arrest or stroke are major causes of death and disability. Biological sex is an important factor in predicting vulnerability of the brain to an ischemic insult, with males being at higher risk for cardio-cerebrovascular events than females of the same age. However, relative incidence of stroke between the genders appears to normalize at advanced ages. Therefore, many scientists have focused on the mechanisms of sex differences in outcome following brain ischemic injury, with a particular emphasis on the role of sex steroids. The majority of studies indicate that female sex steroids, such as estrogen and progesterone, play important roles in the relative neuroprotection following cerebral ischemia observed in females. However, less is known about male sex steroids and brain damage. This review describes the state of our knowledge of androgen-related contributions to neurological injury and recovery following cerebral ischemia that occurs following stroke. Experimental studies examining the effects of castration, androgenic agonists and antagonists and aging provide valuable insights into the role of androgens in clinical outcome following cerebrovascular events.
