{"id":82402,"title":"A bidirectional relationship of oral-systemic responses: observations of systemic host responses in patients after full-mouth extractions.","abstract":"This investigation tested the hypothesis that systemic inflammatory responses would be attenuated by minimizing the oral microbial burden in patients with moderate to severe periodontitis.Patients (n = 73) scheduled for full-mouth extractions were categorized as case type I/II (gingivitis/mild periodontitis) or case type III/IV (moderate/severe periodontitis). Serum levels of acute phase proteins (APPs) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody were assessed at baseline and through 1 year after extraction.At baseline, the levels of multiple APPs (e.g., fibrinogen, C-reactive protein) and antibodies to periodontal pathogens were significantly higher with case type III/IV vs I/II. These differences were sustained 12 months after extractions for most APPs.The results demonstrated that removal of disease by full-mouth extraction of teeth altered the overall burden of challenge to the host. Continued elevation in various APPs in the III/IV group suggested a potential underlying constitutive difference in systemic response characteristics of this population.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630161","annotations":[{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.657937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.518955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.449924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.404676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.372779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Acute-phase protein","weight":0.337442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute-phase_protein"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.147108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.141995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.133996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin domain","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
