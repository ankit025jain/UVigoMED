{"id":70688,"title":"Survivors' experiences of return to work following cancer: A photovoice study.","abstract":"For many working-age cancer survivors, return to work represents a quality-of-life indicator. However, there is currently a lack of resources to assist survivors with navigating this process.As a first step toward informing resources to address this gap, 10 female survivors' return-to-work experiences were explored.Photovoice methods were combined with interviews. Photographs and text were analyzed to identify key themes.Return to work was psychosocially motivated. Survivors independently decided if they would take leave and, if so, when they would return to work. Successful work reintegration was characterized as respectful, collaborative, and customized to each survivor's ongoing limitations and variable recovery.The findings underscore a holistic, client-centred, and collaborative approach to successful return to work with cancer survivors. Occupational therapists, with their vocational rehabilitation knowledge and responsive practice philosophy, are well positioned to address this gap in survivorship support.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154130","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.488943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Philosophy","weight":0.225908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Holism","weight":0.159241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0568479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Social integration","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_integration"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Photovoice","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoice"},{"name":"Occupational therapist","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapist"},{"name":"Vocation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocation"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Survivors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivors"},{"name":"Concurrent estate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_estate"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Vocational rehabilitation","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Underscore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"}]}
