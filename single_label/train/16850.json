{"id":16850,"title":"Comparative genomics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug efflux pumps and their transcriptional regulators.","abstract":"Efflux pump systems are important in general drug resistance. Understanding efflux pumps can inform drug target selection and novel antibiotics designs. In this review, we have summarized the physiological roles, types, and mechanisms of drug efflux pumps. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis, a global threat to public health, and the increasing resistance of this mycobacterium to antibiotics is alarming. Therefore, we have focused on the comparative genomics of efflux pumps and relevant transcriptional regulators of M. tuberculosis.
