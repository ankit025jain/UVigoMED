{"id":67303,"title":"Total arch replacement using moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest and unilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion.","abstract":"To examine the clinical outcomes and impact of using moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA) and unilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (uSACP) in the setting of total aortic arch replacement (TOTAL).From 2004 to 2012, 733 patients underwent open arch reconstruction with MHCA and SACP. Of these, 145 (20%) underwent TOTAL. Measured outcomes included death, stroke, temporary neurologic dysfunction (TND), and renal failure. Mean follow-up time was 33 months and ranged from 0 to 95 months.Core temperature at the onset of MHCA was 25.8°C. Cardiopulmonary bypass and myocardial ischemic times were 236 minutes and 181 minutes, respectively. Twenty-three patients (16%) underwent emergency repair of acute type A dissection. Fifty-four cases (37%) were reoperative and 52 (34%) were stage I elephant trunk procedures. Concomitant root replacement was performed in 50 (35%) patients, including 20 David V valve-sparing procedures. Mean duration of circulatory arrest was 55 minutes. Operative mortality was 9.7%. Overall incidence of stroke and TND was 2.8% and 5.6%, respectively. Four patients (2.8%) required postoperative dialysis. Seven-year survival was significantly reduced (P = .04) after repair of type A dissection (83.8%) compared with elective surgery (89.5%). Higher temperature during TOTAL was not found to be a significant risk factor for adverse events.TOTAL using MHCA and uSACP can be accomplished with excellent early and late results. MHCA was not associated with adverse neurologic outcomes or higher operative risk, despite prolonged periods of circulatory arrest.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629218","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.671336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.547229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cerebral circulation","weight":0.495686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_circulation"},{"name":"Normal human body temperature","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_human_body_temperature"},{"name":"Aortic arch","weight":0.368656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_arch"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.355524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.3065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Elephant","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.185579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.168332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0738637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Natural satellite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite"},{"name":"Arrest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"}]}
