{"id":77932,"title":"Treatment of auricular seroma: a conservative, innovative, and effective approach.","abstract":"Auricular seroma is a cystic swelling filled with serous fluid. It occurs spontaneously or following trauma. Successful treatment of the seroma remains a challenge because this disease has a high propensity for recurrence. The aim was to study the results of the Plaster of Paris (POP) cast in treatment of seroma in terms of complete resolution of swelling, recurrence, and auricular aesthesis.Prospective.Smt. Kashibai Navale Medical College and General Hospital.A total of 48 patients with auricular seroma were studied. They were treated with aspiration of the cyst followed by compression dressing with a POP cast, taking the contour of the pinna. The POP cast was kept for 3 days. The patients were followed up for 6 months for recurrence.Out of 48 patients, 43 patients had complete resolution of the swelling in a single application of the POP cast. Five patients needed 2 applications of the POP cast. Not a single patient had recurrence. Temporary discoloration or thickening of the pinna was noted in 8 patients. No major complications like perichondritis were noted.Aspiration and contour dressing using POP is an innovative and effective treatment for management of auricular seroma as it prevents surgical trauma and recurrence and gives cosmetically excellent results.","date":"2014-10-18","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847161","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.520282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.366363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Paris","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Seroma","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroma"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Plaster of Paris","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster_of_Paris"},{"name":"Pinna (anatomy)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Plaster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Orthopedic cast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_cast"},{"name":"Hyperkeratosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperkeratosis"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Post Office Protocol","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Kashibai","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashibai"},{"name":"Clothing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"},{"name":"Hope","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope"},{"name":"General Hospital","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hospital"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
