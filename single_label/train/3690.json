{"id":3690,"title":"GEP-NETs update: Biotherapy for neuroendocrine tumours.","abstract":"Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) represent a less frequent and heterogeneous group of tumours, which has experienced, in recent years, a significant increase in effective therapeutic possibilities overcoming the disappointing results from chemotherapy. Initial improvements in treatment strategies came from somatostatin analogues (SSAs) that have widely demonstrated a significant improvement in symptomatic relief and tumour control growth by a complex mechanism of action over cell survival, angiogenesis and immunomodulation. Recent investigations have pointed out novel SSAs with a wider binding profile (pasireotide), chimeric molecules against somatostatin receptors and dopamine receptors and the combination with targeted agents, such as mTOR inhibitors or antiangiogenic agents. Immunotherapy is the second cornerstone in NET treatment and has been represented with interferon alpha for a long time, with a demonstrated activity on tumour and clinical response. Its less manageable adverse events have limited its usage. However, different checkpoints in immune system regulation have been effectively targeted in different solid tumours, and novel approaches are currently arising in NETs. In conclusion, biotherapy remains an active treatment strategy for initial approach in patients with NETs. Further investigation on patients' selection, molecular profiles, treatment sequence or combination and optimisation of current and novel biotherapy agents is required.
