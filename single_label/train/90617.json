{"id":90617,"title":"Perforator pedicled propeller flaps for soft tissue coverage of lower leg and foot defects.","abstract":"To investigate the efficiency of perforator pedicled propeller flaps for soft tissue coverage of lower leg and foot defects.Twenty patients (12 male, 8 females; mean age 28 years, range, 5-75) with soft tissue defects of the lower leg and foot were retrospectively reviewed. Their defects had been repaired with perforator pedicled propeller flaps from September 2011 to October 2013 and included five cases of injuries caused by spokes, four of infection with postoperative skin necrosis, two of dorsal skin defects caused by heavy objects and nine caused by car accidents. The areas of soft tissue defect were from 2?cm × 8?cm to 10?cm × 20?cm. Fifteen cases had terminal branch of the peroneal artery perforator flaps and five posterior tibia artery perforator flaps, flap size ranging from 5?cm × 11?cm to 12?cm × 28?cm. Color Doppler ultrasound was used to locate all perforator vessels, the calibers of which ranged from 0.8?mm to 1.0?mm.The intraoperative coincidence rate of the color Doppler ultrasound was 96.7%. The donor sites were sutured directly in 12 cases and skin grafted in 8. One case had a venous crisis within 24?h that was treated by removal some sutures and drainage. All cases were followed up for 1-18 months; all flaps survived well and pedicles had a satisfactory appearance. The patients were extremely satisfied with the results for repair.Perforator pedicled propeller flaps have the advantages over other pedicle flap of being simple, safe, and effective and not involving vascular anastomosis.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Wounds and
