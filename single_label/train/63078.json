{"id":63078,"title":"A phase III randomized trial of high-dose CEOP?+?filgrastim versus standard-dose CEOP in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma: 10-year follow-up data: Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group (ALLG) NHL07 trial.","abstract":"Increasing dose intensity (DI) of chemotherapy for patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) may improve outcomes at the cost of increased toxicity. This issue was addressed in a randomized trial aiming to double the DI of myelosuppressive drugs. Between 1994 and 1999, 250 patients with previously untreated aggressive NHL were randomized to treatment with six cycles of 3-weekly standard (s) or intensive (i) chemotherapy: s-CEOP-cyclophosphamide 750, epirubicin 75, vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2) all on day 1, and prednisolone 100 mg days 1-5; i-CEOP-cyclophosphamide 1,500, epirubicin 150, vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2) all on day 1, and prednisolone 100 mg days 1-5. Primary endpoint was 5-year overall survival (OS). Relative to s-CEOP patients, i-CEOP patients achieved a 78% increase in the DI of cyclophosphamide and epirubicin. Despite this, there was no significant difference in any outcome: 5-year OS (56.7% i-CEOP; 55.1% s-CEOP; P?=?0.80), 5-year progression free survival (PFS; 41% i-CEOP; 43% s-CEOP; P?=?0.73), 5-year time to progression (TTP; 44% i-CEOP; 47% s-CEOP; P?=?0.72), or complete remission (CR)?+?unconfirmed CR (CRu) rates (53% i-CEOP; 59% s-CEOP; P?=?0.64). Long-term follow up at 10 years also showed no significant differences in OS, PFS, or TTP. The i-CEOP arm had higher rates of febrile neutropenia (70 vs. 26%), hospitalisations, blood product utilisation, haematological and gastrointestinal toxicities, and lower quality of life scores during treatment, although without significant differences 6-month later. In the treatment of aggressive NHL in the prerituximab era, increasing DI did not result in improved outcomes, while at the same time lead to increased toxicity.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481640","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Epirubicin","weight":0.792817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epirubicin"},{"name":"Bone marrow suppression","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_suppression"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Febrile neutropenia","weight":0.744689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febrile_neutropenia"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.735738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.6415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombotic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.503506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.242095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.172891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.162218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"National Hockey League","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Blood product","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_product"}]}
