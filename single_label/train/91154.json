{"id":91154,"title":"[Efficacy analysis of intermediate screws technique plus injectable calcium sulfate for thoracolumbar fracture in postmenopausal patients].","abstract":"To explore the clinical efficacies of intermediate screws plus injectable calcium sulfate MIIGX3 for thoracolumbar fracture in postmenopausal patients.A total of 21 postmenopausal patients with vertebral compression fractures reconstructed with posterior internal fixation of intermediate screws technique and anterior vertebral augmentation of MIIGX3 technique in three dimension were retrospectively analyzed. The changes of fracture vertebral height and Cobb's angle were compared.Visual analogue scale (VAS) was performed to evaluate their symptoms. All patients were followed up.Intermediate screws surgical technique plus MIIGX3 was successfully performed. The average injection dose was 4.6 ml.Leakage occurred intraoperatively in two cases. The average follow-up period was 15 (6-36) months. The VAS system demonstrated that pain decreased significantly (preoperative:7.8, postoperative:2.2). The height and Cobb's angle of fractured vertebra improved greatly. The preoperative values were 45.0 ± 6.4% and 19.4 ± 4.5° and postoperative ones 15.4 ± 3.9% and 8.64 ± 3.18° respectively. There was no occurrence of severe complications related with treatment.Except for 2 patients with a loss of 15% of vertebral height, the average heights of fractured vertebra in other 19 patients recovered to 85% of normal ones.Thoracolumbar fracture in postmenopausal patients may be managed satisfactorily by intermediate screws and injectable calcium sulfate technique.Such a technique is both safe and effective. And its stable and durable reduction offers significant improvement.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534306","annotations":[{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.74653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.745269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.634145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.615997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.576707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.443034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Compression fracture","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_fracture"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.363085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.165507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.120224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Calcium sulfate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_sulfate"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"636","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/636"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Manager (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Linguistic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Lateral horn of spinal cord","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_horn_of_spinal_cord"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Carbon leakage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_leakage"},{"name":"Gluten-sensitive enteropathy associated conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-sensitive_enteropathy_associated_conditions"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
