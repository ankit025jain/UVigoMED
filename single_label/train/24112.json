{"id":24112,"title":"Synergism between upregulation of Rab7 and inhibition of autophagic degradation caused by mycoplasma facilitates intracellular mycoplasma infection.","abstract":"Following fusion of a mycoplasma with a host cell membrane, the inserted components of mycoplasma may then be transported through the endocytic pathway. However, the effects of mycoplasmas on the host cell endomembrane system are largely unknown. In this study, mycoplasma?induced changes in the dynamics of endocytic and autophagic systems were investigated. Endocytosis and autophagy are two major processes involved in the survival of intracellular prokaryotic pathogens. It was found that, immediately following infection, mycoplasmas induce endocytosis in the host cell; however, in the long term the mycoplasmas suppress turnover of the components of the endocytic pathway. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that Rab7 and LC3?II are recruited to the intracellular mycoplasma?containing compartments. Western blot analysis and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed that mycoplasmas increase expression of Rab7 by upregulating transcription, but increase levels of LC3?II and p62 by post?translational regulation. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that mycoplasma infection causes inhibition of autophagic degradation of LC3?II and p62. In addition, it was found that upregulation of Rab7 and inhibition of autophagic degradation synergistically contributes to intracellular mycoplasma accumulation. In conclusion, these findings suggest that mycoplasmas may manipulate host cell endosomal and autophagic systems in order to facilitate intracellular infection.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452847","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Endomembrane system","weight":0.875712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomembrane_system"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Prokaryote","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote"},{"name":"Endocytosis","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Mycoplasma","weight":0.768396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.742497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.732463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Endosome","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosome"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.67551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.668966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Posttranslational modification","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttranslational_modification"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.56601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Rab (G-protein)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rab_(G-protein)"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
