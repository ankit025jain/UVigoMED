{"id":53944,"title":"Novel insights into metabolic sequelae of obstructive sleep apnoea: a link between hypoxic stress and chronic diabetes complications.","abstract":"An increasing body of evidence suggests that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, glucose intolerance, and deteriorations in glycaemic control. Despite the knowledge of a multifactorial pathogenesis of long-term diabetes complications, there is a paucity of information on impact of comorbidities associated with chronic intermittent hypoxemia on development and progression of chronic diabetes complications. This review explores the clinical and scientific overlap of OSA and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its possible impact on the development and progression of diabetes macrovascular and microvascular complications. Multiple prospective observational cohort studies have demonstrated that OSA significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease independent of potential confounding risk factors. The current evidence further suggests that OSA with concurrent T2DM is associated with an increased risk of oxidative stress-induced damage of vulnerable endothelial and mesangial cells and peripheral nerves. Further studies are needed to validate the impact of OSA treatment on diabetes micro- and macrovascular complications. Since it is presently still unknown whether OSA treatment may provide a diabetes-modifying intervention that could delay or halt the progression of chronic diabetes complications, the emphasis is on early diagnosis and satisfactory treatment of both OSA and T2DM.
