{"id":87104,"title":"False human immunodeficiency virus test results associated with rheumatoid factors in rheumatoid arthritis.","abstract":"To investigate if immunological factors associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affect the result of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).100 RA cases were enrolled from January 2012 to February 2013 into this study. HIV screening was conducted with ECLIA detecting both HIV-1 p24 antigen, HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies, with ELISA and colloidal gold method detecting HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. The samples producing positive results were submitted to the Center for Disease Control for confirmation using Western blotting method. The antibody titers of rheumatoid factors (RF) including RF-IgG, RF-IgM, RF-IgA, and CCP-IgG were analyzed by ELISA.The HIV positive-rate determined by ECLIA was significantly higher than that by ELISA and colloidal gold method (P<0.01). The false-positive rate of HIV screening was associated with antibody titers of RF-IgG, RF-IgM, RF-IgA, and CCP-IgG in RA (P<0.01).Immunological factors, including RF and anti-CCP antibody, may influence the screening of HIV by ECLIA, producing false-positive result.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998232","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.755043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.724617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.551911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Colloid","weight":0.512074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.276251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Colloidal gold","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloidal_gold"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0283361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Structure and genome of HIV","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_genome_of_HIV"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"}]}
