{"id":31114,"title":"Skin test protocol for the prevention of hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin.","abstract":"Several hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to oxaliplatin have been reported. Presently, there is no reliable way to predict the development of this adverse reaction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reliability of skin tests in the detection of patients at risk of developing HSRs to oxaliplatin.Patients under treatment with oxaliplatin underwent the prick test at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and, if negative, intradermal injection at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, one hour before each course of oxaliplatin, starting from the second administration.A group of 101 patients were submitted to skin tests: two were positive, whereas five developed HSR despite negative tests (false-negative rate: 5.05%). These patients underwent desensitization, which permitted to conclude the planned schedule in five cases.A negative skin test to oxaliplatin has a good reliability in predicting HSRs. We suggest performing tests only in patients that have received at least five courses of oxaliplatin.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24403513","annotations":[{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.492413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.221652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.187801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Presidency of George W.
