{"id":17832,"title":"[Emerging and important antibiotic resistance in Gram negative bacteria: epidemiology, theory and practice].","abstract":"Emerging and clinically-relevant antibiotic resistance mechanisms among Gram-negative rods are the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), carbapenemases, and 16S RNA methylases conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. Those resistance determinants do confer multiresistance to antibiotics. They are found in Enterobacteriaceae (especially community-acquired isolates, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii). Detection of ESBL-producing and carbapenemase-producing isolates rely on the use of rapid diagnostic techniques that have to be performed when a reduced susceptibility to 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins or to carbapenems is observed, respectively. Only an early detection of those emerging resistance traits may contribute to limit their nosocomial spread and to optimize the antibiotic stewardship.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843986","annotations":[{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.909087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.827907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Gram-negative bacteria","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-negative_bacteria"},{"name":"Aminoglycoside","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoglycoside"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Acinetobacter baumannii","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter_baumannii"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Carbapenem","weight":0.801413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbapenem"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"16S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.672903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.358761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bacillus (shape)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_(shape)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby-Bauer_antibiotic_testing"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
