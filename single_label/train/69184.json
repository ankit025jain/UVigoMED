{"id":69184,"title":"[Renal expression of RANK-RANKL in a rat model of puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy].","abstract":"To investigate RANK-RANKL expression in the kidneys of a rat model of puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy (PAN).Thirty-six SD rats were randomly divided into PAN model group and normal control group. PAN was induced by a single intravenous injection of 100 mg/kg puromycin aminonucleoside. Serum creatinine and 24-hour urinary protein were measured on days 3, 7, and 14 after the injection, and renal pathologies were assessed with optical and immune transmission electron microscopy. The expression of RANK and RANKL in the kidneys was examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting.The PAN model rats showed massive proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine on day 3, which peaked on day 7. RANK-RANKL protein and mRNA expressions in PAN model group was higher than those in the control group. In the PAN rats, RANK was expressed mainly on the top cell membrane and in the cytoplasm of renal podocytes with a significantly increased expression level compared with that in the control group.The PAN rat model shows aberrant RANK and RANKL expressions in the podocytes, indicating their contribution to podocyte injury in PAN.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463119","annotations":[{"name":"Transmission electron microscopy","weight":0.881947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.809718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.801147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.784357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.744544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.557844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.468444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.389764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.382358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.25896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Podocyte","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podocyte"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.237768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.073608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Puromycin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puromycin"},{"name":"RANKL","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANKL"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0214552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Polyarteritis nodosa","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyarteritis_nodosa"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
