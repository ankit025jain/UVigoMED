{"id":17280,"title":"Correlation of 13C urea breath test values with Helicobacter pylori load among positive patients.","abstract":"13C urea breath test (13C UBT) is used to detect Helicbacter (H.) pylori in gastric mucosa. There are controversial results regarding associations of 13C UBT values with histopathological grades. We designed this study to correlate 13C UBT values with different histopathological grades in our local setting.13CO2/12CO2 ratio for 13C UBT was analyzed using mass spectrometry and histopatholgical grades were scored by updated Sydney System.13C UBT values of H. pylori positive patients at different times (T10-T60) were higher as compared to negative patients. Significant positive correlation of 13C UBT values at T30 with different scores of H. pylori load (r = 0.277, p = 0.037) was observed. Associations of the mean 13C UBT values with neutrophil infiltration (p = 0.214), mononuclear cell infiltration (p = 0.648), atrophy (p= 0.620), atypia (p = 0.057) and metaplasia scores (p = 0.718) were found to be nonsignificant. H. pylori load significantly correlated with neutrophil infiltration and atrophy with exception of mononuclear cell infiltration, atypia and metaplasia.In the present analysis, significant positive correlation was observed between 13C UBT values and H. pylori load that would be helpful in qauntification of H. pylori in our local setting.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections
