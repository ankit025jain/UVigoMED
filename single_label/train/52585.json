{"id":52585,"title":"Risk of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome in critically ill adult patients with pre-existing diabetes: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The impact of pre-existing diabetes on the development of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) in critically ill patients remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of cohort studies to evaluate the risk of ALI/ARDS in critically ill patients with and without pre-existing diabetes.We searched PubMed and Embase from the inception to September 2013 for cohort studies assessing the effect of pre-existing diabetes on ALI/ARDS occurrence. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using random- or fixed-effect models when appropriate.Seven cohort studies with a total of 12,794 participants and 2,937 cases of pre-existing diabetes, and 2,457 cases of ALI/ARDS were included in the meta-analysis. A fixed-effects model meta-analysis showed that pre-existing diabetes was associated with a reduced risk of ALI/ARDS (OR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.80; p<0.001), with low heterogeneity among the studies (I(2)=18.9%; p=0.286). However, the asymmetric funnel plot and Egger's test (p=0.007) suggested publication bias may exist.Our meta-analysis suggests that pre-existing diabetes was associated with a decreased risk of ALI/ARDS in critically ill adult patients. However, the result should be interpreted with caution because of the potential bias and confounding in the included studies.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24587357","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.892542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Publication bias","weight":0.791577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Funnel plot","weight":0.649073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funnel_plot"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.568981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.52443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.438199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.432482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.302379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0630736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"286","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/286"},{"name":"794","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/794"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"937","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/937"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Chimney","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimney"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Winning percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage"},{"name":"Plot (graphics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(graphics)"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Statistical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome"}]}
