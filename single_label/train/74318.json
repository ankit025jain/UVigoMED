{"id":74318,"title":"Significant immunohistochemical expression of human chorionic gonadotropin in high-grade osteosarcoma is rare, but may be associated with clinically elevated serum levels.","abstract":"Survival rates have plateaued at 70% for osteosarcoma. Proteins ectopically produced by malignant tumors may provide insight into new therapeutic targets. Osteosarcomas secreting human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) have been suggested to have a worse prognosis. We examined the frequency of expression of ?-subunit of hCG (?-hCG) in pretreatment osteosarcoma biopsies, and asked if it was associated with various clinical prognostic parameters, and the development of metastases. We subjected 51 pretreatment biopsies of high-grade osteosarcoma, from 51 patients, to ?-hCG immunohistochemistry. In 19 of these patients, postchemotherapy metastatic biopsies also were examined for ?-hCG expression. Clinical information (patient age, sex, survival status, and serum hCG in females only), and tumor characteristics (site, size, and presence of metastases) were recorded. The ?-hCG positive and negative biopsies were separated and compared. Of 49 interpretable pretreatment biopsies, 28 (57%) showed positive cytoplasmic ?-hCG expression: 27 with sparse positivity (1% of tumor cells) and 1 with frequent positivity (10% of tumor cells). The patient with frequent ?-hCG positivity in her pretreatment biopsy had elevated serum hCG (88.2 mIU/mL) at diagnosis, decreasing to undetectable following chemotherapy and definitive resection. There was no difference in clinical parameters or rate of metastasis between ?-hCG positive versus negative groups. Expression of ?-hCG may be seen in high-grade osteosarcoma, but frequent ?-hCG immunohistochemical expression by tumor cells, associated with clinically elevated serum ?-hCG, is rare. Recognition that some nongerm cell tumors may produce ?-hCG can prevent confusion with malignancies containing neoplastic syncytiotrophoblast cells, including germ cell and trophoblastic tumors.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856811","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.899863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"Germ cell","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.721288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.660403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.619471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.593279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.464585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gestational trophoblastic disease","weight":0.352318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_trophoblastic_disease"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.223116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Trophoblast","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophoblast"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mental confusion","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_confusion"},{"name":"Syncytiotrophoblast","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncytiotrophoblast"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"}]}
