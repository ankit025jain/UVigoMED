{"id":79326,"title":"Identifying the barriers and facilitators to optimal hearing aid self-efficacy.","abstract":"Many older adults with hearing impairment are not confident in their ability to use hearing aids (i.e. experience low hearing aid self-efficacy), which has been found to be a barrier to hearing help-seeking and hearing aid use. This study aimed to determine what factors were associated with achieving adequate hearing aid self-efficacy.A retrospective research design was employed wherein hearing aid self-efficacy was the primary outcome. Explanatory variables included personal demographics, visual disability, and experiences related to participants' hearing ability and hearing aids.A total of 307 older adults with hearing impairment participated in the study (147 non hearing aid owners and 160 hearing aid owners).Non-hearing aid owners were more likely to report adequate hearing aid self-efficacy if they reported no visual disability, had experienced hearing loss for longer, reported more positive support from a significant other, and were not anxious about wearing hearing aids. Hearing aid owners were more likely to report adequate hearing aid self-efficacy if they had had a positive hearing aid experience and no visual disability.More research is needed to develop and evaluate intervention approaches that promote optimal levels of hearing aid self-efficacy among older adults with hearing impairment.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447235","annotations":[{"name":"Disability","weight":0.730436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.606313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.572261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.376664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.221289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.154468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Design of experiments","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Significant other","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_other"}]}
