{"id":68888,"title":"Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and atherosclerosis in chronic kidney disease.","abstract":"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its cousins, such as placental growth factor, have moved into the daily clinical arena. One-step-removed regulators, such as the VEGF splice variant soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), now clinically emerge. sFlt-1 keeps our corneas 'clean.' However, sFlt-1 could also cause disease, such as preeclampsia. The report by Matsui et al. on ApoE and sFlt-1 gene-deleted mice could foster important subsequent research. We are limited only by our imaginations.
