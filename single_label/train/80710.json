{"id":80710,"title":"Microdistribution of the resistance of malaria vectors to deltamethrin in the region of Plateau (southeastern Benin) in preparation for an assessment of the impact of resistance on the effectiveness of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs).","abstract":"This study aims to research two areas, one with a resistant and the other with a susceptible profile of An. gambiae to deltamethrin in the region of Plateau (southern Benin). In each area, eight localities were sought. Both areas were needed for the assessment of the impact of malaria vector resistance to pyrethroids on the effectiveness of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs). The susceptible area of An. gambiae to deltamethrin was used as a control.In total, 119 localities in the region of Plateau were screened by sampling An. gambiae s.l larvae. Female mosquitoes resulting from these larvae were exposed to 0.05% deltamethrin following WHO standards. PCR was used to identify species and molecular forms of the dead and alive mosquitoes. Finally, we identified kdr mutations (1014 F and 1014S) using the HOLA technique.Fifty-six out of 119 prospected localities tested positive for Anopheles gambae s.l breeding sites. The results showed that An. gambiae was resistant to deltamethrin in 39 localities and susceptible in only 2 localities; resistance to deltamethrin was suspected in 15 localities. The HOLA technique confirmed the presence of kdr 1014 F mutation and the absence of kdr 1014S mutation. The kdr 1014 F mutation was found in both M and S molecular forms at relatively high frequencies therefore confirming the susceptibility tests.We were unable to identify the eight susceptible areas due to the overall resistance of An. gambiae to deltamethrin in the region of Plateau. To implement the study, we kept two areas, one with high resistance (R+++) and the other with low resistance (R+) of An. gambiae to deltamethrin.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564260","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.772903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Mosquito","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.674921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.659617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.502772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Anopheles","weight":0.485047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.284761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Benin","weight":0.282443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin"},{"name":"Deltamethrin","weight":0.233635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltamethrin"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Pyrethroid","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethroid"},{"name":"Karaim language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaim_language"},{"name":"Insecticidal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticidal"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"1014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1014"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Prospecting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospecting"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Urban areas in Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_areas_in_Sweden"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"New Jersey Nets","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Nets"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"}]}
