{"id":74596,"title":"The L1 family of cell adhesion molecules: a sickening number of mutations and protein functions.","abstract":"L1-type proteins are transmembrane cell adhesion molecules with an evolutionary well-conserved protein domain structure of usually six immunoglobulin and five fibronectin type III domains. By engaging in many different protein-protein interactions they are involved in a multitude of molecular functions and are important players during the formation and maintenance of metazoan nervous systems. As a result, mutations in L1-type genes cause a great variety of phenotypes, most of which are neurological in nature. In humans, mutations in the L1CAM gene are responsible for L1 syndrome and other L1-type genes have been implicated in conditions as varied as mental retardation, autism, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, and other disorders. Equally, the overexpression of L1-type proteins appears to have deleterious effects in various types of human tumor cells, where they generally contribute to an increase in cell mobility and metastatic potential.","date":"2014-10-10","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25300138","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Autism","weight":0.88057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"},{"name":"Fibronectin","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibronectin"},{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.858127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.805784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Transmembrane protein","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_protein"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.729003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.632844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Crassulacean acid metabolism","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crassulacean_acid_metabolism"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"}]}
