{"id":83887,"title":"Association of antimüllerian hormone levels with menstrual-cycle type and dysmenorrhea in young asymptomatic women.","abstract":"To examine the association between antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels and menstrual-cycle and lifestyle characteristics among young Japanese women.Cross-sectional study.University.Female students aged 20-22 years (n=65) who had never used oral contraceptives.Participants completed a questionnaire on reproductive and lifestyle characteristics, and kept a menstrual-cycle diary for 5 consecutive months. Serum AMH was measured once during the study period.Serum AMH concentration.Compared with women with very mild menstrual pain, serum AMH concentration was 49.6% (95% CI 6.5%-72.8%) lower among women with severe menstrual pain. Higher AMH concentration was associated with irregular menstrual cycles. Even after adjusting for menstrual-cycle regularity and its interaction, more-severe menstrual pain was associated with significantly lower AMH concentration.Circulating AMH concentration was significantly lower among young Japanese women who had more-severe menstrual pain. Underlying physiological mechanisms need to be addressed in future studies.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25226856","annotations":[{"name":"Dysmenorrhea","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmenorrhea"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.81484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Combined oral contraceptive pill","weight":0.669644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.532539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.423819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.39426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.382862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Irregular menstruation","weight":0.270876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_menstruation"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Biological life cycle","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle"},{"name":"Diary","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"572","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/572"},{"name":"2022","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022"},{"name":"Japanese people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_people"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Isomer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomer"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Antimullerian hormone","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimullerian_hormone"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"}]}
