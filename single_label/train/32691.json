{"id":32691,"title":"[The treatment strategy for hypoplastic left heart syndrome].","abstract":"In the recent years, the outcomes of treatment for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is improved because of perioperative management and procedure. We adopt a strategy of the primary Norwood procedure basically for neonates with HLHS, however bilateral pulmonary artery banding precede in patients with risk factors. In the Norwood procedure, aortic arch is reconstructed without artificial prostheses and pulmonary blood flow is supplied from the Blalock-Taussig shunt or the right ventricle-pulmonary artery shunt by case. We administer high dose vasodilators and nitric oxide gas with low resistance strategy after the Norwood procedure. The survival rate of patients with HLHS after 2005 is 84.2% in this strategy.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917161","annotations":[{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.85059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Aortic arch","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_arch"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.521095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Left heart","weight":0.390506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_heart"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.340173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplastic_left_heart_syndrome"},{"name":"Hypoplasia","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplasia"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.238329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Norwood procedure","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwood_procedure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Linguistic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
