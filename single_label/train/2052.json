{"id":2052,"title":"Child abuse in the irritable bowel syndrome.","abstract":"Stress is considered a risk factor for the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). One of the main stress sources is represented by the negative life events and trauma suffered in childhood. Several papers have endorsed the hypothesis that youth submitted to stress are prone to develop IBS. We have undertaken a review of the literature, searching all Pubmed papers pertinent to child abuse and IBS. The data suggest that indeed, children submitted to physical, psychological and sexual abuse are at risk to develop IBS as adults. However, cultural diffferences exist.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509563","annotations":[{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Sexual abuse","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.575048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.561903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.481512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.302835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.259066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
