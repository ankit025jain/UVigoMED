{"id":49021,"title":"PTH(1-84) is associated with improved quality of life in hypoparathyroidism through 5 years of therapy.","abstract":"In hypoparathyroidism, quality of life (QOL) is compromised as compared to normal subjects. We previously reported our results showing an association with recombinant human PTH(1-84) therapy in hypoparathyroidism and improvement in QOL measures for 1 year.We tested the hypothesis that PTH(1-84) therapy in hypoparathyroidism through 5 years would be associated with continued improvement in QOL measures.Sixty-nine hypoparathyroid subjects received open-label PTH(1-84). Before and during therapy, subjects completed the RAND 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) Health Survey, a measure of health-related QOL covering eight domains of physical and mental health.At baseline, subjects scored significantly lower than the normative reference range in all 8 domains (T-scores -1.4 to -0.9; P < .001 for all). With PTH therapy, intention-to-treat analysis showed significant improvement in the overall score at 2 months that persisted through 5 years (386 ± 19 to 482 ± 25; P < .0001). The mental component summary score improved at 2 months and was sustained through 5 years (199 ± 11 to 246 ± 14; P = .001), as did all four individual mental health domains and T-scores (vitality, social functioning, role emotional, mental health). The physical component summary score improved at 2 months and was sustained through 5 years (187 ± 10 to 237 ± 13; P < .0001), as did 3 physical health domains and T-scores (physical functioning, role physical, general health).PTH(1-84) therapy is not only associated with improvement in biochemical and skeletal indices, previously well-documented, but also in mental and physical health as determined by the SF-36 metric.","date":"2014-10-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24978675","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.838373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.472176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.460846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.383733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.256906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"RAND Corporation","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.133765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Reference ranges for blood tests","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests"},{"name":"Hypoparathyroidism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoparathyroidism"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Mountain range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"246","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/246"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Climatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Role-playing video game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game"},{"name":"Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video"},{"name":"Metric (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Vitalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism"},{"name":"Salmson 9","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmson_9"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
