{"id":21311,"title":"Association study of genes controlling IL-12-dependent IFN-? immunity: STAT4 alleles increase risk of pulmonary tuberculosis in Morocco.","abstract":"Only a minority of individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis develop clinical tuberculosis. Genetic epidemiological evidence suggests that pulmonary tuberculosis has a strong human genetic component. Previous genetic findings in Mendelian predisposition to more severe mycobacterial infections, including by M. tuberculosis, underlined the importance of the interleukin 12 (IL-12)/interferon ? (IFN-?) circuit in antimycobacterial immunity.We conducted an association study in Morocco between pulmonary tuberculosis and a panel of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering 14 core IL-12/IFN-? circuit genes. The analyses were performed in a discovery family-based sample followed by replication in a case-control population.Out of 228 SNPs tested in the family-based sample, 6 STAT4 SNPs were associated with pulmonary tuberculosis (P = .0013-.01). We replicated the same direction of association for 1 cluster of 3 SNPs encompassing the promoter region of STAT4. In the combined sample, the association was stronger among younger subjects (pulmonary tuberculosis onset <25 years) with an odds ratio of developing pulmonary tuberculosis at rs897200 for GG vs AG/AA subjects of 1.47 (1.06-2.04). Previous functional experiments showed that the G allele of rs897200 was associated with lower STAT4 expression.Our present findings in a Moroccan population support an association of pulmonary tuberculosis with STAT4 promoter-region polymorphisms that may impact STAT4 expression.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610875","annotations":[{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.833564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Mendelian inheritance","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.793679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.778033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.72031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.654891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.632564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.464597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Morocco","weight":0.370936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.286133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Human genetics","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetics"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"STAT4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT4"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery-MacLeod-McCarty_experiment"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"}]}
