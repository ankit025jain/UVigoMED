{"id":87296,"title":"Role of hyperbaric medicine for intractable leg ulcers: a case report.","abstract":"We present a case report of intractable multifactorial leg ulcer that was treated successfully with multiple approaches including hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) to prepare for skin grafting. A 66-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and Felty's syndrome presented with a non-healing ulcer on her left leg that was caused by a trauma. She failed multiple treatment options including debridement, different wound dressings, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and vein closure procedure. She finally healed with skin graft following HBOT that prepared the wound bed before the procedure.
