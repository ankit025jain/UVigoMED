{"id":65823,"title":"[Three-year results of the treatment of localized prostate cancer using high-intensity focused ultrasound].","abstract":"The study was aimed to the assessment of the effectiveness of treatment for prostate cancer using high-intensity focused ultrasound on the basis of clinical, radiation, laboratory data, and results of morphometric and immunohistochemical study of postoperative prostate biopsies. 112 sessions of HIFU-ablation of the prostate in 112 patients with localized prostate cancer were performed. Average number of impulses of action--634 +/- 176, the average volume of tissue exposed--34.6 +/- 15.2 cm3 per 1 session. The operative time ranged from 90 to 165 min (mean 125 min). The postoperative hospital stay ranged from 7 to 14 days (average 10 +/- 0.8 days). Intraoperative complications during HIFU-ablation were not observed. The average level of prostate-specific antigen 1,5 months after surgery was 0.7 (0.12-3.67) ng/ml. Minimum level of prostate-specific antigen was reached 20 +/- 2 weeks after treatment, and the average level was 0.26 +/- 0.01 ng/ml. 6 months after, prostate volume decreased by an average of 49%; 10-12 months after intervention, prostate volume was 6.5 +/- 2.2 cm3. Morphological analysis after treatment included studies with standard and immunohistochemical staining using the following antibodies: PCNA, Bcl2, AMACR, E-cadherin, ANDR. Recurrence-free course was observed in 96 (85.8%) patients. Recurrences were detected in 16 (14.2%) patients, with biochemical progression in 11 (9.82%) patients. Local recurrence (morphologically confirmed) was diagnosed in 5 (4.46%) patients.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772773","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.770054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.573269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.571808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.333004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"High-intensity focused ultrasound","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_focused_ultrasound"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proliferating_cell_nuclear_antigen"},{"name":"Morphological analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"634","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/634"},{"name":"1012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1012"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"}]}
