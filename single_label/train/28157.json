{"id":28157,"title":"The emergence of international food safety standards and guidelines: understanding the current landscape through a historical approach.","abstract":"Following the Second World War, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) teamed up to construct an International Codex Alimentarius (or 'food code') which emerged in 1963. The Codex Committee on Food Hygiene (CCFH) was charged with the task of developing microbial hygiene standards, although it found itself embroiled in debate with the WHO over the nature these standards should take. The WHO was increasingly relying upon the input of biometricians and especially the International Commission on Microbial Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) which had developed statistical sampling plans for determining the microbial counts in the final end products. The CCFH, however, was initially more focused on a qualitative approach which looked at the entire food production system and developed codes of practice as well as more descriptive end-product specifications which the WHO argued were 'not scientifically correct'. Drawing upon historical archival material (correspondence and reports) from the WHO and FAO, this article examines this debate over microbial hygiene standards and suggests that there are many lessons from history which could shed light upon current debates and efforts in international food safety management systems and approaches.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24990138","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Food safety","weight":0.711043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety"},{"name":"Food and Agriculture Organization","weight":0.695425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization"},{"name":"World War II","weight":0.691396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.673635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.663049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Biostatistics","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostatistics"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.466554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Food industry","weight":0.464734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_industry"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.293714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.229649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.212662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.149228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.130887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.128276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Codex Alimentarius","weight":0.043079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Alimentarius"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Specification (technical standard)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)"},{"name":"Drawing","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Landscape","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"ISO 22000","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_22000"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Codex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex"},{"name":"1963","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963"},{"name":"Archive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Moulting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulting"},{"name":"Intelligent design movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design_movement"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
