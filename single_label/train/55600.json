{"id":55600,"title":"A review of pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension.","abstract":"It is now well recognized that idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can occur in children. Relative to the adult population, the demographic features and clinical presentation of IIH as well as the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for children are quite different. Although these differences are well established, specific diagnostic and treatment guidelines for pediatric patients have largely been based on the adult literature. Exciting new evidence is now available to assist the clinician in managing pediatric patients with IIH.
