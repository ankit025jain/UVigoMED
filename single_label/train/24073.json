{"id":24073,"title":"Streptococcus pyogenes cervical intertrigo with secondary bacteremia.","abstract":"We report a 12-month-old infant girl with cervical intertrigo caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. This form of intertrigo has been reported in only five children, but it is clearly underestimated. It should be suspected for well-demarcated beefy-red lesions of the neck not responding to antifungal therapy. A rapid streptococcal antigen test of a lesion specimen is a useful diagnostic tool. Our patient was notable for the development of S. pyogenes bacteremia, a complication that has not been previously associated with this condition.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456009","annotations":[{"name":"Streptococcus pyogenes","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pyogenes"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.853393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.608697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.330141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"}]}
