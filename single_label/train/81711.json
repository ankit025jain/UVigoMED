{"id":81711,"title":"Sleep bruxism: review and update for the restorative dentist.","abstract":"Sleep bruxism (SB) is a parafunctional oromotor activity that can sometimes pose a threat to the integrity of the structures of the masticatory system if the magnitude and direction of the forces exerted exceed the system's adaptive capacity. Over the years science has tried to provide a consistent explanation of the etiopathogenesis and physiopathology of SB, although the pathophysiological mechanisms are, even now, not fully understood yet. There is at present no specific, effective treatment to permanently eliminate the habit of SB. There are only palliative therapeutic alternatives steered at preventing the pathological effects of SB on the stomatognathic system and alleviating the negative clinical consequences of the habit. The aim of this paper is to review and update the fundamental scientific concepts of SB based on the scientific literature and to furnish an approach to the main types of therapy available, in an attempt to assist the general and restorative dentist to manage those clinical situations in which SB is a significant risk factor for the oral health and/or dental treatment of the patient.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864394","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.645253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.338889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.247891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.231754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.212202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.147825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Dental surgery","weight":0.147371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_surgery"},{"name":"Scientific literature","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.108378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Bachelor of Science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
