{"id":24621,"title":"[Analysis of renal protein expressions of spontaneously hypertensive rat intervention by three different Chinese medicine compounds for hypertension].","abstract":"To observe the differential protein expression profile of three different Chinese medicine compounds on spontaneous hypertensive rat, which were Banxiabaizhutianma Decoction, Dihuangyinzi Decoction and Tianmagouteng Decoction, and to elaborate their function characters and regulation pathway using the principal component analysis and analyze the basic theory of different treatment of hypertension.Give three compounds to 6-week-old SHR (Spontaneous hypertensive rat) as experimental group and captopril to 6-week-old WKY (Wistar-Kyoto rat) as control group by gavage. Monitor the blood pressure of rat tail to 24-week-old and then all rats were decapitated. Extracte the rental protein to finish two-dimensional electrophoresis experiments and get the differential protein spots using PDQuest software. Study the three different compounds' effect of trend on SHR blood pressure using PCAC principal component analysis.The blood pressure of SHR remained rising from 6-week-old to 10-week-old, when Tianmagouteng Decoction had a significant anti-hypertension effect. But as the blood pressure of SHR remained high, Banxiabaizhutianma Decoction and Dihuangyinzi Decoction performed better in lowering blood pressure. At last, renal protein expression profile analysis showed that there were 84 significantly different proteins between SHR and WKY of 24-week-old and the PCA result showed that the principal component extraction was 95.951%, it was sure that Tianmagouteng Decoction and Banxiabaizhutianma Decoction had significantly changed rental protein spots on SHR while Dihuangyinzi Decoction had not.In the early stages of rising blood pressure, Tianmagouteng Decoction has significant anti-hypertensive effect. But when the blood pressure remain high, Banxiabaizhutianma Decoction and Dihuangyinzi Decoction are superior to Tanmagouteng Decoction in anti-hypertension. Banxiabaizhutianma Decoction and Tianmagouteng Decoction can significantly improve rental protein spots on SHR while Dihuangyinzi Decoction can not.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335292","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.791862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.679559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.613327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.576941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.559619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.53402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.466457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"China","weight":0.464223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Decoction","weight":0.407246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoction"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.35922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Captopril","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captopril"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.237213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.209477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Principal component analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Decapitation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapitation"},{"name":"Differential equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
