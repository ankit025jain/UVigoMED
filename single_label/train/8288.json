{"id":8288,"title":"Effect of Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction on focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury through regulating the expression of excitatory amino acids and their receptors.","abstract":"Gua Lou Gui Zhi decotion (GLGZD) has been reported to be an effective treatment for post?apoplectic limb spasm in the clinic. The present study aimed to investigate whether GLGZD had an affect on cerebral injuries induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats and its possible mechanism. High?performance liquid chromatography was performed to analyze GLGZD. Furthermore, a model was established to assess the efficacy of GLGZD. Neurological defect scores and screen tests were analyzed. Brain ischemic infarct volume was measured using 2,3,5?triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining and glutamic acid (Glu), aspartic acid (Asp) and glycine (Gly) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid were measured using the Hitachi automatic amino acid analyzer. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine the expression of the ??amino?3?hydroxy?5?methyl?4?isoxazole?propionic acid (AMPA) and N?methyl?D?aspartic acid (NMDA) glutamate receptors, and to analyze histopathological change. GLGZD was found to improve neurological performance and reduce infarct volumes in MCAO rats. In addition, GLGZD was observed to enhance motor performance, which was assessed using the screen test. Furthermore, GLGZD was found to reduce Glu, Asp and Gly levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and downregulate the protein expression of the AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors. Thus, it was demonstrated that GLGZD may exert neuroprotective effects through the modulation of excitatory amino acids, and AMPA and NMDA receptor expression.
