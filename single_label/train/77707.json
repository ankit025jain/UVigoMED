{"id":77707,"title":"Characteristics of and risk factors for compensated occupational injury and disease claims in dairy farmers: a case-control study.","abstract":"Research indicates that dairy farmers have an elevated risk of work-related adverse health outcomes. This case-control study evaluated the characteristics of and risk factors for compensated occupational injury and disease claims among Finnish dairy farmers. The cases consisted of 19 farm couples in which both spouses had a history of multiple claims. There were 283 claims in total, a rate of 26.6 claims per 100 person-years. The controls consisted of 12 couples in which neither spouse had compensated or rejected claims during their work history as insured farmers. A combined mail/telephone survey charted potential risk factors for compensated claims. These claims frequently involved work tasks and causes related to animal husbandry. Cattle were the most common cause for injuries in general and for serious injuries in particular. Gender differences in farm work and claims were observed. Using logistic regression analyses, we identified personal and work-related risk factors including long work history, small-scale dairy farm operation, and conventional stanchion barn for dairy cattle. Outdated working conditions, while not statistically significant, were positively associated with claims as well. Declined current work ability and musculoskeletal or respiratory conditions were significantly associated with claims where each of these outcomes may contribute to the other. Identified factors could be used to select subgroups of dairy farmers with either elevated or reduced risk of claims. Prevention of adverse health outcomes could be most effective when targeted to farmers at highest risk of occupational injury and disease.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400423","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.765893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.622971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Animal husbandry","weight":0.520492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_husbandry"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.43994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.359393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.348623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.340536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"History","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.265972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.2216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.17956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Dairy","weight":0.152706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Sex differences in humans","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Barn","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Convention (norm)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Dairy farming","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Dairy cattle","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle"}]}
