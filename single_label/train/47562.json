{"id":47562,"title":"Radiofrequency ablation for colorectal liver metastases.","abstract":"The management of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer (HMCRC) is multimodal including chemotherapy, surgical resection, radiation therapy, and focused destruction technologies. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most commonly used focused destruction technology. It represents a therapeutic option that may be potentially curative in cases where surgical excision is contra-indicated. It also increases the number of candidates for surgical resection among patients whose liver metastases were initially deemed unresectable. This article explains the techniques, indications, and results of radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of hepatic colorectal metastases.
