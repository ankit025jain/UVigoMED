{"id":82164,"title":"The antiplaque effect of herbal mouthwash in comparison to chlorhexidine in human gingival disease: a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety, antiplaque and antigingivitis properties of a herbal mouthwash with chlorhexidine mouthwash.A double-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted among 72 undergraduate students with age group 18-24 years. They were randomly divided into three mouthwash group with 24 participants in each group. Group A (herbal), Group B (chlorhexidine) and Group C (normal saline).The Turesky et al. 1970 plaque index and Loe and Silness 1963 gingival index was recorded. Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to test the significance.A statistically highly significant difference was obtained between mouthwash B and C (p=0.00) and a significant difference between mouthwash A and C (p=0.004), showing that chlorhexidine was superior to herbal mouthwash and saline. However, there was a nonsignificant difference between mouthwash A and B (p=0.435) showing that herbal and chlorhexidine mouthwash was equally effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis.The efficacy of herbal mouthwash was equally effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis as compared to chlorhexidine mouthwash and may be considered as a good alternative. The chlorhexidine mouthwash was reported with many side effects which limits its acceptability and long-term use, whereas the presently tested herbal mouthwash had no side effects apart from mild burning sensation.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698829","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Chlorhexidine","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.799516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.716289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.625212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.524287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.516083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.409985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.320291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Mouthwash","weight":0.286252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthwash"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"1824","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1824"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Loe of Maui","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loe_of_Maui"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Undergraduate education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
