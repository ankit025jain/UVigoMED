{"id":68431,"title":"Significance of urodynamic examination in patients with spinal cord lesions and verified neurogenic urination dysfunction.","abstract":"Evaluation of neurogenic urination dysfunction by urodynamic examination in patients with spinal cord lesions is essential for ensuring the effective emptying of the bladder and the prevention of urological complications.To establish the relation between urodynamic findings with the development of complications of the upper urinary tract (UUT) in patients with spinal cord lesions.This is a retrospective study involving 42 patients with spinal cord lesions in which are analyzed complications of UUT incurred in an average 4-year period. It also included urodynamic examination of 41 patients (one patient with definitely placed catheter) and the results are compared with the found UUT complications. Among urodynamic parameters were compared the values of bladder compliance (C), maximum detrusor pressure in the filling phase (Pdet.max) and detrusor activity.UUT complications: nephrolithiasis 24%, ureteropieloectasia 21%, chronic pyelonephritis 10% and hydronephrosis in 5% of patients. In 26 (64%) patients were found low compliance (C < 20 ml/cmH2O), and preserved in 15 (36%) patients. Pdet.max. was significantly lower in patients with preserved compliance (p < 0.01). According detrusor activity was found 22 (54%) hyper reflex and 19 (46%) areflexic bladders. In the group with areflexic bladder, UUT complications has 7 (37%), in group of hyper reflex bladder 10 (45%) patients. In areflexic bladder with UUT complications was found significantly lower levels of compliance (p < 0.01) than in the group without complications.In our sample of patients with spinal cord lesions was demonstrated the impact of low compliance to the occurrence of UUT complications. It is also in case of the areflexic bladder found significant difference in compliance between the groups with and without UUT complications. Maintaining bladder compliance and low values if intracystic filling pressure the most important tasks in maintaining vesico-sfincteral balance, and thus prevention of urological complications in patients with spinal cord lesions.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520758","annotations":[{"name":"Hydronephrosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronephrosis"},{"name":"Pyelonephritis","weight":0.863267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyelonephritis"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.809594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.806587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.702943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.584424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.471614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Detrusor urinae muscle","weight":0.448751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detrusor_urinae_muscle"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.366311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.361225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Hyperthyroidism","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Urodynamic testing","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urodynamic_testing"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
