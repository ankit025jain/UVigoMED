{"id":25664,"title":"Relationship between pre-implant ejection fraction and outcome after cardiac resynchronization therapy in symptomatic patients.","abstract":"Left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is regarded as a strong predictor for morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients. The aim of the analysis was to assess the relationship between pre-implant LVEF and outcome of patients with advanced heart failure who received cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).We analysed the two-year follow-up of 366 patients who had been enrolled in the MASCOT study which included NYHA class III/IV patients with a class I CRT indication. Pre-implant LVEF was stratified by tertile.The boundaries for pre-implant LVEF were < 22% (n = 128; 18.2 +/- 3.1%; T(low)), 22% to 28% (n = 121; 25.4 +/- 1.4%; T(middle)) and > 28% (n = 117; 32.6 +/- 3.9%; T(high)) for each tertile.Two-year post-implant LVEF was 32.0 +/- 11.5% (T(low)), 33.7 +/- 10.8% (T(middle)) and 36.4 +/- 9.9% (T(high)). T(Iow) had a greater increase between pre- and post-implant LVEF compared to T(middle) (P = 0.03) and T(high) (P = 0.0001). NYHA class improved similarly among the three groups as well as the quality of life score. No significant differences were detected between the three groups for all-cause mortality, cardiac death, all-cause hospitalization, and hospitalization due to worsening heart failure.Symptomatic heart failure patients with a wide QRS complex and a severe impaired LV function had a better improvement of their pre-implant LVEF than patients with a more preserved LVEF. This may be one reason that in these patient groups long-term morbidity and mortality were not related to their pre-implant LVEF. Pre-implant LVEF was in symptomatic CRT patients not predictive for their long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25181918","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.31555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.244585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Cathode ray tube","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Thigh","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"},{"name":"Cardiac resynchronization therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_resynchronization_therapy"},{"name":"QRS complex","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRS_complex"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0191606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"New York Heart Association Functional Classification","weight":0.0188318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Heart_Association_Functional_Classification"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Latvia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Quantile","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"}]}
