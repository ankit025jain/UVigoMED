{"id":89549,"title":"[Treatment of the anterior tibial tuberosity for avulsion in adolescents].","abstract":"Avulsions of the anterior tibial tuberosity are infrequent lesions that nevertheless have long-term functional repercussions as a result of the lesion itself and of the treatment provided.A series of 12 patients treated surgically from January 2008 to March 2012 was reviewed. Their diagnosis was Watson-Jones types II and III lesions; they were assessed by applying the Kujala functional scale and radiographically by measuring the tibial tuberosity index. The statistical analysis was done with central trend measurements and non-parametric tests.All patients were male and right knee lesions were slightly predominant. All of them participated in sports activities and the predominant mechanism of injury was forced knee hyperflexion. The evaluation using the Kujala scale showed excellent results. The tibial tuberosity index was not statistically significant with respect to the implants used.This type of injuries warrants surgical management to restore the function of the knee extensor mechanism.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707602","annotations":[{"name":"Injury","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.667327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.651478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.589453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.548236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.357311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.129025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Tuberosity of the tibia","weight":0.0311921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberosity_of_the_tibia"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0241801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Warrant (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(finance)"},{"name":"Non-parametric statistics","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Anterior tibial artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_tibial_artery"},{"name":"Tubercle (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubercle_(anatomy)"}]}
