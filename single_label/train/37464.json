{"id":37464,"title":"The incidence of avascular necrosis and the radiographic outcome following medial open reduction in children with developmental dysplasia of the hip: a systematic review.","abstract":"The incidence of clinically significant avascular necrosis (AVN) following medial open reduction of the dislocated hip in children with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) remains unknown. We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify all clinical studies reporting the results of medial open reduction surgery. A total of 14 papers reporting 734 hips met the inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up was 10.9 years (2 to 28). The rate of clinically significant AVN (types 2 to 4) was 20% (149/734). From these papers 221 hips in 174 children had sufficient information to permit more detailed analysis. The rate of AVN increased with the length of follow-up to 24% at skeletal maturity, with type 2 AVN predominating in hips after five years' follow-up. The presence of AVN resulted in a higher incidence of an unsatisfactory outcome at skeletal maturity (55% vs 20% in hips with no AVN; p < 0.001). A higher rate of AVN was identified when surgery was performed in children aged < 12 months, and when hips were immobilised in ? 60° of abduction post-operatively. Multivariate analysis showed that younger age at operation, need for further surgery and post-operative hip abduction of ? 60° increased the risk of the development of clinically significant AVN.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24493198","annotations":[{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.799044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.746945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.708981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.493634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.432034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.399804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Dislocation of hip","weight":0.302909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation_of_hip"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.137764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.105721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (human)","weight":0.087394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(human)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"734","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/734"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Bone age","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_age"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Abduction (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Iroquois class destroyer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_class_destroyer"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
