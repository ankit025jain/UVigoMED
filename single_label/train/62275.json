{"id":62275,"title":"[Research progress of microRNA in chronic lymphocytic leukemia].","abstract":"MicroRNA (miRNA) is a small endogenous noncoding single-stranded RNA molecule with about 22 nucleotides, and the high conservation in a variety of species exists in most eukaryotes. miRNA can recognize and bind to the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of target mRNA via complementary base pairing, then degrading or inhibiting translation of the target mRNA. The miRNA participates in the growth and progression development of individual organism and of the disease by regulating the gene expression after transcription. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignant proliferative disease of B lymphocytes with insidious onset, showing significant heterogeneity in the incidence of individual, disease progression, treatment response, clinical prognosis and so on. Now, more and more studies have shown that mutation or abnormal expression of miRNA are closely related to CLL occurrence, progression, prognosis and curative efficacy. Complex and diverse miRNA in CLL may play a role of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. In the near future, some miRNAs may even become fresh biomarkers or therapeutic targets of CLL. This review will focus on miRNA molecules related to the pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment of CLL.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
