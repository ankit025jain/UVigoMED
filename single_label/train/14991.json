{"id":14991,"title":"1-alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 regresses endometriotic implants in rats by inhibiting neovascularization and altering regulation of matrix metalloproteinase.","abstract":"The exact pathogenesis of endometriosis has not been completely discerned. 1-alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH][2]D[3]) has been shown to have an anti-angiogenic effect and extracellular matrix-proteases-degrading properties. We hypothesized that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) may have therapeutic value in the treatment of endometriosis.Endometrial tissue was implanted into the abdominal peritoneum of 21 Wistar albino rats; the rats were randomized into 3 groups. In Group A (simultaneous group), we simultaneously induced endometriosis and began 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment. Group B rats (sequential group) were treated after endometriosis was documented. Animals in Group C (control group) were followed without any treatment after the development of endometriosis.Histologic score, mean volume, and weight of the explants in Group A and B were found to be significantly lower than those of the control group. Levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) immunoreactivities in Group A and B were also significantly lower compared with Group C. In contrast, intensities of immunoreactivity staining for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) in Group A and B were significantly higher than that of the control group.1,25(OH)(2)D(3) regresses endometriotic implants in rat models by altering implant levels of VEGF, TIMP-2, and MMP-9.","date":"2014-01-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24393757","annotations":[{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.799526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Angiogenesis inhibitor","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.673874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.623679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.387499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.34931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.338221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.330124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.325809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.30029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.133206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0625596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Hydroxyl","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Explant culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explant_culture"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
