{"id":1451,"title":"Evaluation and comparison of alpha- and beta-amanitin toxicity on MCF-7 cell line.","abstract":"Alpha- and beta-amanitins are the main toxins of the poisonous Amanita phalloides mushroom. Although there are many studies available concerning alpha-amanitin, there are limited data about beta-amanitin in the literature. Therefore, this study is aimed at comparing the toxic effects of alpha- and beta-amanitin on the MCF-7 cell line.The alpha- and beta-amanitins used for this research were purified from Amanita phalloides by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography. The MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was used, and specific concentrations of the toxins (100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 ?g/mL) were applied to the cells. The MTT test was performed to determine the level of toxicity, and the quantity of protein in the cell was measured using the biuret test.The aLpha-amanitin showed a higher toxicity at 36 h, while the highest inhibition of protein synthesis by the beta-amanitin was observed at 24 h.It was shown that the beta-amanitin may be responsible for toxicity, like alpha-amanitin, in Amanita phalloides mushroom poisoning. The early inhibition of protein synthesis for beta-amanitin might be useful for future experiments and research.","date":"2014-12-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25539537","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Mushroom poisoning","weight":0.83581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom_poisoning"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Mushroom","weight":0.737514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.736317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Amanita phalloides","weight":0.70518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_phalloides"},{"name":"Protein biosynthesis","weight":0.704806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.704052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.2769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Amanita","weight":0.117087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Water purification","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_purification"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"MCF-7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"}]}
