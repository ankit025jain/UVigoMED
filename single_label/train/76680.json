{"id":76680,"title":"Self-reported versus actual weight and height data contribute to different weight misperception classifications.","abstract":"The purpose of the study was to examine potential differences between two approaches to defining adolescent weight misperception. Specifically, weight status perception was compared with self-reported weight status and actual weight status (based on body mass index percentiles calculated from self-reported and actual weights and heights, respectively). Furthermore, the accuracy of assigning weight status based on body mass index percentiles calculated from self-reported weights and heights was assessed by comparing them with actual weight status.Data were extracted from Team Up for Healthy Living, an 8-week, school-based obesity prevention program in southern Appalachia. Participants (N = 1509) were predominately white (93.4%) and ninth graders (89.5%), with approximately equivalent representation of both sexes (50.7% boys).The study revealed significant differences between the approaches to defining weight misperception (?(2) = 16.2; P = 0.0003).Researchers should interpret study findings with awareness of potential differences based on the method of calculating weight misperception.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24945166","annotations":[{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.613286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.522964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.381316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.318165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.296135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.216396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Appalachia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"1509","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1509"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Up (2009 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)"},{"name":"Representation theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Knowledge representation and reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Marvel Team-Up","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Team-Up"}]}
