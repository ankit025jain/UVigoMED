{"id":68013,"title":"Vaginal trachelectomy following laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy and sacrocervicopexy.","abstract":"Current evidence supports cervical preservation at the time of abdominal prolapse repair using synthetic mesh to minimize vaginal mesh extrusion. This report aims to describe management of benign cervical disease following laparoscopic sacrocervicopexy including successful trachelectomy performed vaginally.A 70-year-old sexually active woman presented with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. Her Papanicolaou smears over several years were unremarkable, and she had a benign endocervical polyp removed in the office 3 months before surgery. She underwent an uncomplicated robotic-assisted laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy and sacrocervicopexy. She presented 8 months after surgery with persistent vaginal spotting after intercourse and was found to have a recurrent endocervical polyp. Ultimately, she underwent uncomplicated trachelectomy performed vaginally with resolution of her symptoms.Retention of the cervix at the time of mesh-augmented abdominal prolapse repairs introduces a unique set of evaluation and management considerations for benign cervical disease. Trachelectomy performed vaginally was successful and uncomplicated in this case.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24566218","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.790158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pap test","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pap_test"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.608726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Canal of the cervix","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_of_the_cervix"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.473084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.376849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.326184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sexual reproduction","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Smear campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign"},{"name":"Metrorrhagia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrorrhagia"}]}
