It discusses the nature and prevalence of sleep disturbances associated with traumatic brain injury and the measures used to assess them. Potential causes are discussed, including damage to sleep-wake regulating centers, disruption of circadian timing of sleep, and secondary causes, such as pain, depression, and anxiety. The nature and assessment of fatigue are discussed, followed by a review of evidence regarding causes. Evidence is reviewed of the consequences of sleep disturbance and fatigue. Potential treatments of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic natures are reviewed.
