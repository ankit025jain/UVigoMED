{"id":244,"title":"The effects of magnesium nanovesicle formulations on spatial memory performance in mice.","abstract":"The study investigates the effects of magnesium nanovesicles on the memory processes performance in mice.L-a-phosphatidylcholine was used to obtain nano formulations as lipid vesicles systems stabilized thereafter with chitosan. The experiment was carried out on white Swiss mice, divided into 3 groups of 7 animals each, treated orally 7 consecutive days: Group I (Control): 0.1 mL/10g distilled water; Group II (Mg): 1 mmol/kbw magnesium chloride; Group III (Mg-vesicles): 1 mmol/kbw magnesium nanovesicles. The spatial memory performance was assessed by recording spontaneous alternation behavior in Y-maze test. Each animal was placed at the end of one arm and allowed to move freely through the maze during a single 8 min session. Alternation was defined as a consecutive entry in three different arms. The alternation percentage was computed according to the formula: (number of alternations/total number of arm visits--2) x 100. Data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 software. Experimental protocols were implemented according to the recommendations of the University Committee for Research and Ethical Issues.New carrier formulations entrapping magnesium chloride were designed: their mean size was 129.56 nm and the mean Zeta potential was +36.1 mV, indicating a moderate stability of the solution. Oral administration of magnesium vesicles resulted in a significant increase of spontaneous alternation percent in Y-maze test (p < 0.01), which suggests an improvement of short-term memory.Using magnesium chloride entrapped in lipid vesicles induced an enhancement of cognitive functions in mice especially by facilitation of learning extinction.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Animal
