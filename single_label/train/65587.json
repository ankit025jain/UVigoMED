{"id":65587,"title":"The RNA-binding protein Mex3b regulates the spatial organization of the Rap1 pathway.","abstract":"The four related mammalian MEX-3 RNA-binding proteins are evolutionarily conserved molecules for which the in vivo functions have not yet been fully characterized. Here, we report that male mice deficient for the gene encoding Mex3b are subfertile. Seminiferous tubules of Mex3b-deficient mice are obstructed as a consequence of the disrupted phagocytic capacity of somatic Sertoli cells. In addition, both the formation and the integrity of the blood-testis barrier are compromised owing to mislocalization of N-cadherin and connexin 43 at the surface of Sertoli cells. We further establish that Mex3b acts to regulate the cortical level of activated Rap1, a small G protein controlling phagocytosis and cell-cell interaction, through the activation and transport of Rap1GAP. The active form of Rap1 (Rap1-GTP) is abnormally increased at the membrane cortex and chemically restoring Rap1-GTP to physiological levels rescues the phagocytic and adhesion abilities of Sertoli cells. Overall, these findings implicate Mex3b in the spatial organization of the Rap1 pathway that orchestrates Sertoli cell functions.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24803656","annotations":[{"name":"Phagocytosis","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"},{"name":"Seminiferous tubule","weight":0.858244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminiferous_tubule"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.809257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"G protein","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Conserved sequence","weight":0.717984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.702046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.6775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.622487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.614581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.577214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Sertoli cell","weight":0.512041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertoli_cell"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.450172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.361956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Guanosine triphosphate","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"GTPase-activating protein","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTPase-activating_protein"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Tubule","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubule"},{"name":"Connexin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connexin"},{"name":"Small GTPase","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_GTPase"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"}]}
