{"id":66728,"title":"Varicocele: a dilemma in adolescent males.","abstract":"Varicoceles are the most common cause of infertility in men. Despite the high prevalence of varicoceles, only a small percentage of men with varicoceles have subfertility or infertility. In adolescents, the prevalence of varicoceles increases dramatically during puberty to reach adult prevalence rates. The development of varicoceles during puberty can impair testicular growth and function. Data on hormonal and semen parameters in adolescents with varicoceles are limited, making it harder to determine which varicoceles are associated with infertility and which may benefit from surgery. The main indications for varicocelectomy in adolescents with varicoceles include a volume differential between unaffected and affected testes or abnormality in semen analysis.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683951","annotations":[{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Semen analysis","weight":0.698398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_analysis"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.663049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.564199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Varicocele","weight":0.547549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicocele"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.289447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Subfertility","weight":0.0525655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfertility"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Data (Star Trek)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Dilemma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
