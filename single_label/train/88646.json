{"id":88646,"title":"Defining the role for submental intubation.","abstract":"Submental intubation, a less invasive alternative to tracheostomy, was first described for acute airway management of maxillofacial trauma patients, where nasoendotracheal intubation was contraindicated and oral intubation was not possible due to the desire to establish dental relationships perioperatively. While submental intubation is used most commonly in trauma patients, the range of indications for its use has broadened to include many orthognathic and skull base surgical procedures. Submental intubation is a safe, effective technique for many maxillofacial procedures, requiring the cooperation of both anesthesiologists and maxillofacial surgeons.
