{"id":51808,"title":"Multimodal treatment of distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy in diabetic patients: a randomized clinical trial.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the application of analyzing treadmill, muscle strengthening, and balance training compared with a standard care intervention in patients with diabetic neuropathy.Twenty-seven patients, 63% female (mean ± standard deviations age, 72 ±9 years), with diabetic neuropathy randomly assigned to receive a multimodal manual treatment approach including analyzing treadmill with feedback focused, isokinetic dynamometric muscle strengthening, and balance retraining on dynamic balance platform or a standard care intervention for activities targeted to improve endurance, manual exercises of muscle strengthening, stretching exercises, gait, and balance exercises (5 weekly over 4 weeks). This study was designed as a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Measures were assessed at pretreatment, 4 weeks posttreatment, and 2-month follow-up.No important baseline differences were observed between groups. At the end of the treatment period, the experimental group showed a significant increase in gait endurance in a 6-minute walk test, 65.6 m (F[2.0] = 9.636; P = .001). In addition, the 6-minute walk test increased after the intervention, and an even greater difference was found at follow-up (P = .005) for the standard care group. The Functional Independence Measure in both groups increased (P < .01) and continued until the follow-up in the standard care group (P = .003).The results suggest that the experimental rehabilitation program showed positive effects on the gait endurance after 4 weeks of treatment, whereas it did not produce significant improvements of the gait speed. Both the treatments produced significant improvement of functionalities of the patient.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656867","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.723856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.649242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.592001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Polyneuropathy","weight":0.405357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyneuropathy"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.358068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.290076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Diabetic neuropathy","weight":0.258022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.244139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Stretching","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretching"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.120387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Endurance","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"636","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/636"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Psychodynamics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodynamics"},{"name":"Tire balance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_balance"},{"name":"Retraining","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retraining"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Sensorimotor","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorimotor"},{"name":"Weight training","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_training"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Treadmill","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treadmill"}]}
