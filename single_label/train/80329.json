{"id":80329,"title":"PCR for the diagnosis of abdominal angiostrongyliasis in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tissue.","abstract":"To date the diagnosis of abdominal angiostrongyliasis (AA) depends on the histological identification of Angiostrongylus costaricensis (AC) in surgical specimens. However, microscopic evaluation is time consuming and often fails in identifying the parasite. We tested whether PCR might help in the diagnosis of AA by identifying parasite DNA in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. We used primers based on DNA from Angiostrongilus cantonensis. Four groups of FFPE intestinal tissue were tested: (1) confirmed cases (n = 20), in which AC structures were present in the target tissue; (2) presumptive cases (n = 20), containing changes secondary to AC infection in the absence of AC structures; (3) negative controls (n = 3), consisting of normal colonic tissue; and (4) tissue affected by other parasitoses (n = 7), including strongyloidiasis, ascaridiasis, schistosomiasis, and enterobiasis. Most lesions of confirmed cases were located in small and/or large bowel (90%), as compared with presumptive cases, in which 70% of lesions were in appendix (P = 0.0002). When confronted with cases of other parasitoses, PCR showed sensitivity of 55%, specificity of 100% and positive predictive value of 100%. In presumptive cases PCR was positive in 4 (20%). All specimens from negative controls and other parasitoses were negative. In conclusion, the PCR technique showed intermediate sensitivity and optimal specificity, being clinically relevant when positive for abdominal angiostrongyliasis. It allowed a 20% gain in diagnosis of presumptive cases. PCR might help in the diagnosis of abdominal angiostrongyliasis, particularly when the pathologists are not experienced with such disease.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705328","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.865603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.808285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.770581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Vermiform appendix","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermiform_appendix"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Microscopic scale","weight":0.370113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_scale"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.285351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.118236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Surgical pathology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_pathology"},{"name":"Strongyloidiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongyloidiasis"},{"name":"Enterobiasis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobiasis"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Intermediate host","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_host"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
