{"id":88349,"title":"Relative motion splint: active motion after extensor tendon injury and repair.","abstract":"The relative motion splint was initially developed to facilitate postoperative rehabilitation after repair of extensor tendon injuries at the dorsum of the hand and forearm. It has subsequently been used for rehabilitation of sagittal band injuries and after repair of closed attrition extensor tendon ruptures in rheumatoid arthritis. This is much less awkward than other braces and can readily be worn during normal past-time and work activities. This so-called immediate controlled active motion splinting protocol has also more recently been applied to both operative and nonsurgical rehabilitation for boutonniere deformity.
