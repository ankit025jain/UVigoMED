{"id":30205,"title":"Optical coherence tomography findings in ocular argyrosis.","abstract":"A 68-year-old Caucasian man with a remote history of daily colloidal silver ingestion presented for ophthalmic examination in which he was noted to have a distinct slate gray skin discoloration. Funduscopy revealed confluent perimacular drusenoid deposits bilaterally, most of which localized at the level of or anterior to the inner segment ellipsoid band by optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Enhanced depth imaging OCT demonstrated marked choroidal thinning. Fluorescein angiogram displayed a dark or silent choroid. Confirmatory serum silver levels were found to be markedly elevated. This report describes a unique geographic maculopathy with large drusenoid deposits anterior to the ellipsoid layer and severe choroidal thinning in association with ocular argyrosis.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548762","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.913125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.703373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.674841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.668085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.37875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"History","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Colloid","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid"},{"name":"Silver","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.061283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Slate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate"},{"name":"Ellipsoid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid"},{"name":"Medical uses of silver","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_uses_of_silver"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Silent film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Grey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey"},{"name":"Thinning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinning"},{"name":"Confluence (abstract rewriting)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence_(abstract_rewriting)"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Slate gray","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_gray"},{"name":"Maculopathy","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maculopathy"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
