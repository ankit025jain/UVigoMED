{"id":47413,"title":"[miR-520a regulates ErbB4 expression and suppresses proliferation and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma].","abstract":"To investigate the role of miR-520a in regulation ErbB4 expression and the biological behavior of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).The role of miR-520a in regulating the expression of ErbB4 was investigated by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay system. The effect of miR-520a on the proliferation and invasion of ESCC cells was detected by MTT and Transwell invasion assay, respectively.Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-520a down-regulated the expression of ErbB4 in vitro. miR-520a significantly inhibited the proliferation and suppressed the invasion of ESCC cell line Eca109.miR-520a regulates the expression of ErbB4 and suppresses the proliferation and invasion of ESCC cells in vitro, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589589","annotations":[{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.916687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.741545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.738373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.700638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.656323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.574279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.477993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.41286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.401339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.36041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"ErbB","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ErbB"},{"name":"ERBB4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERBB4"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Reporter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter"},{"name":"Suppressor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressor"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"}]}
