{"id":76716,"title":"An update on the pharmacological strategies in the treatment of HIV-1-associated adipose redistribution syndromes.","abstract":"With the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection in the mid-1990s, descriptions of morphological changes and metabolic disturbances in treated patients began to emerge. HIV-1/highly active ART-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS) involves metabolic abnormalities and diverse forms of anomalous fat distribution. The current review focuses on the pathophysiological basis and the clinical evidence for the use of several medical strategies in the management of HALS.We have covered the most relevant studies related to the pharmacological strategies in the treatment of HALS, with attention to the current and novel antiretroviral agents.The most commonly used strategies for HALS reversion have included modification of host-dependent factors, including those related to HIV-1 infection and those associated with ART. Preventive and medical strategies have been associated with moderate success. The only intervention that offers an immediate aesthetical improvement for patients with HALS so far has been plastic surgery.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934336","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.782034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.721571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.484276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.448361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.342151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.33402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Lipodystrophy","weight":0.293509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipodystrophy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.196893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.027246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"1990s","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Liberalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"}]}
