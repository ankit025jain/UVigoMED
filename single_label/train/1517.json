{"id":1517,"title":"Recovery based on spirituality in substance abusers in Iran.","abstract":"Spirituality is an important factor influencing the decrease of substance abuse severity and maintenance of the recovery phase. This research, investigates the effect of spiritual experiences in the recovery of substance abusers.Qualitative data was collected from 16 men and 6 women, selected through purposeful sampling to ensure an equilibrated gender representation and data from different recovery periods. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews.Data showed two main categories: \"Mutual relationship between spirituality and recovery,\" divided into four subcategories: religious background, religious teachings, experience exchange, and support of family and society; and \"A new perspective toward life\" subdivided into access to calmness and spiritual development. A factor \"spirituality meaning religion\" arose repeatedly throughout the study.The results of this study can be useful for policy makers, care providers, families, and drug addicts. The promotion of spirituality in substance abusers can help in their struggle with temptation. Effective strategies to ensure drug abstinence and maintenance of the recovery phase are encouraging substance abusers and their families to participate in spirituality-based psychotherapy sessions held in addiction treatment centers, multi-disciplinary cooperation among the organizations involved in the addiction phenomenon, and training the families regarding the importance of spirituality in the mental health of their children through mass media.","date":"2014-11-03","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363097","annotations":[{"name":"Iran","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.793451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Spirituality","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality"},{"name":"Religion","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.671246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Religious experience","weight":0.645987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_experience"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.539905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.513376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.479993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.440807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.387952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.371548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.363865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.246245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Perspective (cognitive)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)"},{"name":"Representative democracy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy"},{"name":"Alimony","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alimony"},{"name":"Economic development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development"},{"name":"Promotion (marketing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(marketing)"}]}
