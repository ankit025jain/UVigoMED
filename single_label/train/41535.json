{"id":41535,"title":"Metabolic kinetics of 5-hydroxytryptamine and the research targets of functional gastrointestinal disorders.","abstract":"5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter in both the central and enteric nervous systems. It has diverse functions in regulating gastrointestinal motility and visceral sensitivity, emotion, appetite, pain and sensory perception, cognition, sexual activity and sleep. These functions are mainly associated with the metabolic kinetics of 5-HT in different tissues. Tryptophan hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme and modulates serotonin synthesis. Vesicular monoamine transporter 1 plays a role in 5-HT storage and release. Degradation of 5-HT is mediated by monoamine oxidase-A. All these factors influence the action of 5-HT in vivo. Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are characterized by a series of symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, anxiety and depression, in the absence of identifiable structural or biochemical abnormalities. They are frequently accompanied by changed gut motility or visceral sensitivity. An increasing body of research has found FGIDs to be closely associated with 5-HT, and drugs such as citalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine, alosetron, tegaserod, prucalopride and mosapride have all been developed or discovered from the perspective of the metabolic kinetics of 5-HT. This review discusses the relationship between the metabolic kinetics of 5-HT and research targets in the field of FGIDs and suggests areas of future study that may be useful for understanding these disorders and identification of potential therapeutic targets.
