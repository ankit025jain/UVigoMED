{"id":38579,"title":"Pattern of blood vessels in eyes with coloboma.","abstract":"Choroidal coloboma, especially with optic disc involvement affects the blood vessel (BV) pattern in the fundus.The aim of this study was to report the observations on the pattern of retinal BVs in eyes with fundus coloboma.Retrospective observational study.Twenty four eyes of 19 patients with fundus coloboma and the disc involvement in the coloboma was classified according to a previous publication.Four varieties of BVs were identified in the area of coloboma - BVs that were continuous with those arising from the optic disc; vessels emanating from the floor of coloboma whose continuity with central retinal artery or its branches could be indirectly established; and those emanating from the floor of coloboma whose continuity with central retinal artery could not be established. In addition, extraocular BVs were visible through the thinned sclera. The retinal BVs often traversed the coloboma to reach the normal retina. The disc itself was found to be small and had no physiological cup (if not colobomatous).One should be aware of the major BVs transgressing the coloboma while performing relaxing cuts in the intercalary membrane, during the surgery for retinal detachments in eyes with coloboma. Physiological cup is usually absent (when the disc is not colobomatous). Hence, any cupping in such eyes should be viewed with suspicion.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413826","annotations":[{"name":"Sclera","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclera"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.902567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.511024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Optic disc","weight":0.443331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_disc"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.263052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.192779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Coloboma","weight":0.161645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloboma"},{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.153446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0891297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Intercalation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Central retinal artery","weight":0.024844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_artery"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Fire cupping","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_cupping"},{"name":"Marine transgression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_transgression"},{"name":"Besloten Vennootschap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besloten_Vennootschap"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Detachment (military)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment_(military)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
