{"id":76337,"title":"[Adherence to statin treatment and associated factors in female users from the Unified Health System (SUS)].","abstract":"To identify the adherence rate of a statin treatment and possible related factors in female users from the Unified Health System.Seventy-one women were evaluated (64.2 Â± 11.0 years) regarding the socio-economic level, comorbidities, current medications, level of physical activity, self-report of muscular pain, adherence to the medical prescription, body composition and biochemical profile. The data were analyzed as frequencies, Chi-Squared test, and Mann Whitney test (p<0.05).15.5% of women did not adhere to the medical prescription for the statin treatment, whose had less comorbidities (p=0.01), consumed less quantities of medications (p=0.00), and tended to be younger (p=0.06). Those patients also presented higher values of lipid profile (CT: p=0.01; LDL-c: p=0.02). Musculoskeletal complains were not associated to the adherence rate to the medication.The associated factors to adherence of dyslipidemic women to statin medical prescription were age, quantity of comorbidities and quantity of current medication.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076276","annotations":[{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.789907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.781812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor","weight":0.703602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.698576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.694254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.631295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.445284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.361111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Isle of Man","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"}]}
