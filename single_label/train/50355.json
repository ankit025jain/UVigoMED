{"id":50355,"title":"Strong association between insulin-mediated glucose uptake and the 2-hour, not the fasting plasma glucose concentration, in the normal glucose tolerance range.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between whole-body insulin-mediated glucose disposal and the fasting plasma glucose concentration in nondiabetic individuals.Two hundred fifty-three nondiabetic subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance, and combined glucose intolerance received a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Total glucose disposal (TGD) during the insulin clamp was compared in IFG and NGT individuals and was related to fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose concentrations in each group.TGD varied considerably between NGT and IFG individuals and displayed a strong inverse relationship with the 2-hour plasma glucose (PG; r = 0.40, P < .0001) but not with the fasting PG. When IFG and NGT individuals were stratified based on their 2-hour PG concentration, the increase in 2-hour PG was associated with a progressive decrease in TGD in both groups, and the TGD was comparable among NGT and IFG individuals.The present results indicate the following: 1) as in NGT, insulin-stimulated TGD varies considerably in IFG individuals; 2) the large variability in TGD in IFG and NGT individuals is related to the 2-hour PG concentration; and 3) after adjustment for the 2-hour proglucagon concentration, IFG subjects have comparable TGD with NGT individuals.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796924","annotations":[{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.792838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.656289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.258783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.2449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.143318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.116894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Impaired fasting glucose","weight":0.115812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_fasting_glucose"},{"name":"Proglucagon","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proglucagon"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Inverse relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_relationship"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Clamp (tool)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamp_(tool)"},{"name":"Toleration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toleration"},{"name":"Engineering tolerance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Glucose uptake","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_uptake"}]}
