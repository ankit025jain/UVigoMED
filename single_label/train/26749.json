{"id":26749,"title":"[Sexual activity and cardiovascular risks].","abstract":"Sexual activity is a major aspect of the quality of life in the general population as well as in cardiac patients. It can be compromised by the disease itself (endothelial dysfunction, vascular or cardiac impairment) or by the treatments prescribed. An appropriate treatment should be proposed, including phosphodiesterase inhibitors in men with erectile dysfunction. The risk of cardiovascular complication during sexual activity is low and should not restrain sexual activity in the vast majority of patients. An evaluation of this risk should be made on an individual basis and counseling should be proposed to men and women with cardiovascular diseases regarding their sexual activity. But the most important point, for general practitioners and cardiologists, is to take initiative and talk to the patients about these problems.
