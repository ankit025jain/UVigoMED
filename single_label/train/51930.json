{"id":51930,"title":"Asymptomatic coronary artery disease in type II diabetes.","abstract":"Coronary artery disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus and remains one of the largest burdens on health care resources. Prevalence of asymptomatic CAD in this population is high and poses a diagnostic challenge due to lack of overt clinical complaints. At this time there is no clear algorithm to screen for silent myocardial ischemia in diabetics. In this article we review various diagnostic tools available for assessment and propose a step wise approach for risk stratification in these patients.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24645303","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.776875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.603533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.461358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.459079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.346209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.270446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Myocardial ischemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_ischemia"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Silent film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}]}
