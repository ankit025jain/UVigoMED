{"id":22033,"title":"Helicobacter pylori: future perspectives in therapy reflecting three decades of experience.","abstract":"The rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance has created a need to reassess the established Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication protocols, and to develop new ones. Various bacterial and host factors are evaluated, and their contribution to eradication failure is estimated. For a long time being considered the cornerstone eradication scheme, the standard triple therapy has been replaced with novel, more efficient regimens, namely sequential and concomitant, along with the emergence of a new design of bismuth quadruple therapy. A rescue levofloxacin based regimen has overcome the fear of therapy failure due to higher prevalence of dual resistant (clarithromycin and metronidazole) H. pylori. Culture-free and efficient susceptibility test are reestablishing the concept of tailored therapy, making eradication success close to originally desirable rates. Alleviating therapy side effects and improving patient compliance are as important as choosing appropriate eradication schemes, so various probiotic compound supplements are taken into consideration. Finally, we summarize the emerging efforts and obstacles in creating efficient H. pylori vaccine.
