{"id":37358,"title":"Aortic arch and pulmonary artery reconstruction during heart transplantation after failed Fontan procedure.","abstract":"Recent significant improvement in surgical management of patients with univentricular palliations has resulted in an increasing number of patients with complex univentricular heart repairs surviving to heart transplantation. Heart transplantation in these patients can be challenging and may require extensive vascular reconstruction during transplantation. Herein, we describe the surgical reconstruction in a complex patient that was required prior to heart transplantation.
