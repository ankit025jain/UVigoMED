{"id":23647,"title":"First documented outbreak of KPC-2-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in Switzerland: infection control measures and clinical management.","abstract":"We report the epidemiological and clinical features of the first outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-KP) type 2 in Switzerland. The outbreak took place in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of our tertiary care hospital and affected three severely ill patients. After the implementation of strict infection control measures, no further patients colonised with KPC-KP could be detected by the screening of exposed patients. Successful treatment of patients infected with KPC-KP consisted of a combination therapy of meropenem, colistin and tigecycline.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477886","annotations":[{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.774202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.6622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.642864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.443158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.422166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.330556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.244307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.20453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Meropenem","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meropenem"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Colistin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colistin"},{"name":"Tigecycline","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigecycline"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
