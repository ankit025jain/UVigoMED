{"id":1883,"title":"Use of mini dental implants in ectodermal dysplasia children: follow-up of three cases.","abstract":"Ectodermal dysplasia is a hereditary genodermatosis characterised by a congenital defect of ectodermal structures, causing tooth malformations and anomalies. Implantology has become accepted in these subjects. However cases are often complicated by a reduction in the size of the alveolar process, making the insertion of conventional implants difficult without bone grafting. The reduced diameter of mini-implants and their ease of insertion provide an interesting solution in supporting removable or fixed prosthesis. The purpose of this paper is to report the follow-up of three cases of children (11-12 year-old) with ectodermal dysplasia in which mini-implants were used to support the prostheses.In the first case, two mini-implants were inserted into the anterior part of the mandible for stabilising a removable denture (2 years follow-up). In the other two cases, mini-implants were inserted in the maxilla and mandible to replace missing front teeth with fixed prostheses. Patients were called for follow-up every 6 months: in the sencod case follow-up lasted 4 years in the mandible and 2 years in the maxilla; in the third case, 2 years in the maxilla and 1 year in the mandible.The use of mini-implants in children with ectodermal dysplasia can enhance aesthetics, and functional and psychosocial development.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25299020","annotations":[{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"Ectodermal dysplasia","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectodermal_dysplasia"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.813278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.748794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.662512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.64065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.587969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.356338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.187896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Ectoderm","weight":0.0424933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectoderm"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Genodermatosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genodermatosis"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.0276051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Social change","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change"}]}
