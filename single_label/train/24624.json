{"id":24624,"title":"[Effects of twirling-rotating reinforcing and reducing technique for left ventricular morphology, concentration of ET-1 and expression of type I, III collagen mRNA in spontaneous hypertensive rats].","abstract":"To explore the effect differences between twirling-rotating reinforcing and reducing technique of acupuncture on cardiac damage in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR).Sixty male 11-week-old SHR were randomly divided into four groups: a model control group (group A), a twirling-rotating reinforcing technique group (group B), a twirling-rotating reducing technique group (group C) and a needle retaining group (group D), 15 rats in each one. In addition, twelve male 11-week-old Wistar rats were used as a blank control group (group E). Acupuncture was not used in group A and group E, only with grasp, capture and binding stimulation that was also adapted in the rest groups. Rats in the group B were treated with acupuncture at \"Taichong\" (LR 3) by twirling-rotating reinforcing technique for 1 min and then the needles were retained for 9 min; rats in the group C were treated with acupuncture at \"Taichong\" (LR 3) by twirling-rotating reducing technique for 1 min and then the needles were retained for 9 min; rats in the group D were treated with acupuncture at \"Taichong\" (LR 3) but without any technique and then needles were retained for 10 min. Before and after acupuncture, blood pressure monitor was used to measure the rats' systolic pressure and diastolic pressure every 6 days. Twenty-eight days after the treatment, HE and Masson staining were adopted to observe the status of left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. ELISA method was applied to test the content of endothelin-1 (ET-1). PCR semiquantitative method was used to analyze Type I and III collagen mRNA in the left ventricular.(1) Blood pressure: after the treatment, the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure were both increased in the group A and the group B (P < 0.05); while the two pressures were both lowered in the group C and the group D (P < 0.05), which was more obvious in the group C (P < 0.05). (2) According to HE and Masson staining, except for the group E, the myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis could be found in the rest groups, in which the group C was the modest, followed by the group D, while the group A and the group B were more severe. (3) Concentration of ET-1: there were differences of concentration of ET-1 among 5 groups (P < 0.05), and the concentration value from high to low was the group A, B, C, D and E. (4) Type I collagen mRNA: the difference of level of Type I collagen mRNA between group C and D was not statistically significant (P > 0.05); compared with the group A and B, the level was lower in the group C; the level was the lowest in the group E. Type III collagen mRNA: the difference between the group A and B was not statistically significant (P > 0.05); compared with the group A, B and D, the level was lower in the group C.The twirling-rotating reducing could reduce the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure in SHR, effectively prohibit the production of ET-1 and expression of Type I and III collagen mRNA, and it has more obvious inhibiting effect on Type III collagen mRNA. There is biological effect difference between twirling-rotating reinforcing and reducing technique.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Cardiovascular
