{"id":88992,"title":"Chronic Essex-Lopresti injuries: an alternative treatment method.","abstract":"Currently, no technique has met general acceptance for the restoration of forearm longitudinal stability in chronic Essex-Lopresti injuries. The purpose of this study is to present an alternative treatment method for chronic Essex-Lopresti lesions by radial head replacement and ulnar shortening osteotomy.Seven patients with a mean age of 42.4 years were included in the study. Five patients had a staged approach, and 2 underwent both procedures simultaneously. The pain level was assessed with the use of a visual analog scale. Elbow, forearm, and wrist range of motion was evaluated. The Mayo Elbow Performance Score and Mayo Wrist Score were used to assess the postoperative outcomes.The mean follow-up time was 33 months. The mean pain level was reduced from 8.4 points preoperatively to 3.3 points postoperatively (P < .05). The elbow arc of motion was increased on average from 79° preoperatively to 121° postoperatively (P < .05). Forearm rotation improved from 76° preoperatively to 119° postoperatively (P < .05). The wrist arc of motion improved from 94° preoperatively to 114° postoperatively (P < .05). The mean postoperative Mayo Elbow Performance Score and Mayo Wrist Score were 82 points and 71 points, respectively. The mean ulnar variance was reduced from +8 mm to +3.5 mm postoperatively.This study shows that radial head replacement in combination with ulnar shortening osteotomy can be used as an alternative reconstructive procedure in the case of a complex chronic Essex-Lopresti injury. This combination of known procedures yields predictable and satisfactory outcomes and a low complication rate.Level IV, case series, treatment study.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766790","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.760797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.497609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.493117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.454162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.384824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Head of radius","weight":0.0510479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_radius"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"8 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Radial nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_nerve"},{"name":"TRS connector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_connector"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Yield (wine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(wine)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mayo GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
