{"id":43246,"title":"A large epidemic of hepatitis B in Serbia: an integrated model for outbreak investigations in healthcare settings.","abstract":"We report a comprehensive approach for outbreak investigations, including cluster analysis (Bernoulli model), an algorithm to build inferential models, and molecular techniques to confirm cases. Our approach may be an interesting tool to best exploit the large amount of unsystematically collected information available during outbreak investigations in healthcare settings.
