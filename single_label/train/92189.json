{"id":92189,"title":"Trauma recidivists: surprisingly better outcomes than initially injured trauma patients.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine if there was a difference in hospital outcomes between trauma recidivists (RCID) and nonrecidivists (NRCID).Outcomes of RCID and NRCID were compared. A recidivist was defined as a patient with a history of hospital evaluation for injury within the prior 5 years. Patients with good functional status had a Glasgow Outcome Score of 4 to 5.Of the 2,127 patients admitted, 466 (22%) were RCID. NRCID were more likely to have Injury Severity Score >25 (12% vs 8.6%; P = .04) than RCID. Eighty-eight percent of RCID were discharged with a good functional status compared with 83% of RCID (P = .02). NRCID were more likely to be admitted to a critical care unit (43% vs 36%; P = .01), but there was no significant difference in hospital mortality.RCID were less severely injured and had better hospital outcomes than NRCID.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439159","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.505455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.277041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Recidivism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"Injury Severity Score","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_Severity_Score"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Reedy Creek Improvement District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reedy_Creek_Improvement_District"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Military unit","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_unit"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"}]}
