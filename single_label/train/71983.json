{"id":71983,"title":"One-pot synthesis and functionalisation of Fe2O3@C-NH2 nanoparticles for imaging and therapy.","abstract":"The authors have prepared amine-modified Fe2O3@C nanoparticles with diameter of 20 nm by decomposing perchlorinated pyrene/Fe(NO3)3 mixture in the presence of ammonia in solvothermal conditions at 180Â°C for 48 h by a one-step process. NH3 is not only a cocatalyst of Fe(NO3)3 for decomposition of perchlorinated pyrene, but also the source of surface functionalisation group. The effect of synthesis conditions on shape and size of nanoparticles and characterisation of their structure and functionalisation group are investigated in this research. The amino group in the surface of core-shell nanoparticles can be further functionalised with polyethylene glycol and folic acid to improve their solubility in aqueous solution and target cancer cells. The applications of functionalised core-shell nanoparticles in magnetic resonance imaging and cancer thermal therapy are also investigated in this research.
