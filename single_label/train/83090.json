{"id":83090,"title":"Type I IFN signature in primary Sjögren's syndrome patients.","abstract":"Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltrates in salivary and lacrimal glands. Clinical manifestations range from ocular and oral dryness to vasculitis and severe fatigue. pSS is a disease with heterogeneous symptoms and a variable response to the available treatment. Recently, a key role for Interferon (IFN) type I has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pSS. As type I IFN consists of 17 different subtypes, it cannot be easily assessed using a conventional ELISA. Therefore the expression of type I IFN inducible genes--the so-called type I IFN signature--is assessed in salivary gland tissue and blood from patients as a readout for type I IFN activity. In this review we discuss the potential of type I IFN as a novel biomarker for disease activity, subclassification of patients, prediction of therapy response and most importantly as a target for therapeutic intervention.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450331","annotations":[{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.833344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Lacrimal gland","weight":0.756113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_gland"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.571019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.285637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.230397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
