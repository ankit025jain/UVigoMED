{"id":61813,"title":"Unusual splenic hemangioma of a pediatric patient: hypointense on T2-weighted image.","abstract":"Splenic hemangioma is a very rare neoplasm in children. On magnetic resonance imaging, splenic hemangioma shows high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. In this report, we present the first pediatric case of a splenic hemangioma, which was significantly hypointense on T2-weighted images.
