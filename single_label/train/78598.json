{"id":78598,"title":"[Rhinoplasty with autogenous nasal septal cartilage for saddle nose caused by nasal trauma].","abstract":"To observe the efficacy of rhinoplasty with autogenous nasal septal cartilage for saddle nose caused by nasal bone and nasal septum fracture after trauma.During the treatment process of 30 cases of nasal trauma, simple nasal bone fracture reposition and nasal septum correction was done, and rhinoplasty was done using the nasal septal cartilage. All the patients were followed up to evaluate subsequent effect.All the patients were satisfied with the result of one stage repairment. After following-up for 3-42 months, 28 cases (93.3%) were of long-term satisfaction.Rhinoplasty with autogenous nasal septal cartilage for saddle nose was an effective method to repair the nasal trauma.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620665","annotations":[{"name":"Rhinoplasty","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoplasty"},{"name":"Nasal bone","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bone"},{"name":"Nasal septum","weight":0.861554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septum"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.805059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.439618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Saddle nose","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_nose"},{"name":"Stage (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"342","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/342"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Saddle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
