Gentamicin was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic (92.2 days of therapy/1000 patient-days). Only 6% of courses spanned >6 days of therapy and 89% of antibiotic therapy days were with a single antibiotic active against GNB. There was no significant difference between gentamicin and meropenem in the number of first courses in which a resistant GNB was identified in blood cultures [11/1177 (0.9%) versus 5/351 (1.4%); P?=?0.43] or respiratory tract specimens [59/951 (6.2%) versus 17/246 (6.9%); P?=?0.68] at the time of starting therapy.This study demonstrates long-term adherence to a 5 day course antibiotic guideline for treatment of ICU-associated GNB infections. This guideline is a potential antibiotic-sparing alternative to currently recommended dual empirical courses extending to ?7 days.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573413","annotations":[{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Meropenem","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meropenem"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.806856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.505388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.33486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.319691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.208523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Sampling bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
