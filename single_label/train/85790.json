{"id":85790,"title":"Transforming growth factor-Beta inhibits heme oxygenase-1 expression in lung fibroblast through nuclear factor-kappa-B-dependent pathway.","abstract":"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. However, the expression of HO-1 in fibroblasts under fibrotic conditions has not been studied.This study was conducted to investigate the expression of HO-1 in lung fibroblasts from mice and humans under fibrotic conditions by Western blot.We found that the expression of HO-1 was significantly decreased in lung fibroblasts isolated from bleomycin-challenged mice in comparison with control mice. Transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) inhibited HO-1 expression and induced differentiation in human lung fibroblasts. Pretreatment with nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) activation inhibitor or knockdown of the NF-?B p65 subunit attenuated TGF-?-induced inhibition of HO-1 expression and differentiation in human lung fibroblasts. Similarly, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induced TGF-? expression and decreased HO-1 expression in human lung fibroblasts. Interestingly, pretreatment with neutralized anti-TGF-? antibody attenuated LPA effects in human lung fibroblasts.These data suggested that TGF-? inhibited HO-1 expression in human lung fibroblasts through activation of NF-?B.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854244","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.941928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Heme","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.685517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.680865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.661925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Lysophosphatidic acid","weight":0.661871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysophosphatidic_acid"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.625994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.4205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.289498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Heme oxygenase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme_oxygenase"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Human lung","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_lung"},{"name":"RELA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELA"},{"name":"Oxygenase","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenase"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
