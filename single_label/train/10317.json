{"id":10317,"title":"Antidepressant-like effects of auraptenol in mice.","abstract":"Depression is a major psychiatric disorder affecting nearly 21% of the world population and imposes a substantial health burden on society. Current available antidepressants are not adequate to meet the clinical needs. Here we report that auraptenol, an active component of the traditional Chinese medicine, angelicae dahuricae radix, had antidepressant-like effects in mice models of depression. In mouse forced swimming test and tail suspension test, two validated models of depression, auraptenol dose-dependently decreased the immobility duration within the dose range of 0.05-0.4?mg/kg. In addition, the antidepressant-like effects of auraptenol was significantly averted by a selective serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (1?mg/kg). These doses that affected the immobile response did not affect locomotor activity. In summary, this study for the first time identified an active component from the herbal medicine angelicae dahuricae radix that possesses robust antidepressant-like efficacy in mice. These data support further exploration for the possibility of developing auraptenol as a novel antidepressant agent in the treatment of major depression disorders.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24658501","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.526731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"World population","weight":0.522117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.48136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"China","weight":0.464223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.45057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.320984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"5-HT1 receptor","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT1_receptor"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.282582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.100962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Behavioural despair test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_despair_test"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Haiti","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
