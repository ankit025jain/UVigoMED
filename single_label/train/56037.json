{"id":56037,"title":"Evaluation of inner retinal layers in eyes with temporal hemianopic visual loss from chiasmal compression using optical coherence tomography.","abstract":"We measured macular inner retinal layer thicknesses using frequency-domain optical coherence tomography (fd-OCT) and correlated these measures with visual field (VF) in eyes with temporal hemianopia from chiasmal compression and band atrophy (BA) of the optic nerve.Macular fd-OCT scans and VFs were obtained from 33 eyes of 33 patients with temporal hemianopia and 36 control eyes. The macular retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL), combined retinal ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers (RGCL+), and the inner nuclear layer (INL) were segmented. Measurements were averaged for each macula quadrant. Scans were assessed qualitatively for microcysts in the INL. The VF was estimated from the central 16 test points. The two groups were compared. Correlations between VF and OCT measurements were assessed.The mRNFL, RGCL+, and total retinal (TR) macular thickness measurements were significantly smaller in BA eyes than controls. In the nasal quadrants, INL measurements were significantly greater in BA eyes than controls. The mRNFL and RGCL+ measurements had greater discrimination ability than TR measurements in the temporal quadrants. A significant correlation was found between most OCT parameters and their corresponding VF parameters. The strongest association was observed between RNFL and RGCL+ thickness, and VF loss in the corresponding area. The INL microcysts were found in seven eyes with BA, but not in controls.Band atrophy leads to mRNFL and RGCL+ thinning, and INL thickening, and mRNFL and RGCL+ measurements are correlated strongly with VF loss. Segmented macular thickness measurements may be useful for quantifying neuronal loss in chiasmal compression.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24764062","annotations":[{"name":"Retinal ganglion cell","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_ganglion_cell"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Ganglion cell","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cell"},{"name":"Optic nerve","weight":0.87818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Macula of retina","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula_of_retina"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Inner nuclear layer","weight":0.780751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_nuclear_layer"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Nerve fiber","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_fiber"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.565748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Ganglion cell layer","weight":0.461266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cell_layer"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.44628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Nerve fiber layer","weight":0.356341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_fiber_layer"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.270474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Inner plexiform layer","weight":0.206474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_plexiform_layer"},{"name":"Hemianopsia","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemianopsia"},{"name":"Optic disc","weight":0.149922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_disc"},{"name":"Vision loss","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.125854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.122677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0361352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"}]}
