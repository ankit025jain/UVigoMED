{"id":83585,"title":"[Problem of intraoperative hemotransfusion].","abstract":"We studied 66 patients (males aged 39.5 +/- 5.3) with hemorrhagic shock II. Gas composition of arterial and venous blood and a detailed analysis of the blood were studied twice (before and after hemotransfusion).We found that a low-volume (up to 2 doses) transfusion of erythrocyte mass with terms of storage up to 3 days, held after bleeding stop and hypovolemia correction, is the most effective treatment for hemorrhagic shock II.Substitution therapy in operating room does not contribute oxygen transfering in tissues and inhibits stimulation of the bone marrow due to hypoxia. Thus the substitution therapy is an aggravating factor when the bleeding stopped, but hypovolemia not eliminated.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306679","annotations":[{"name":"Hypovolemia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovolemia"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.814156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.742257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.720731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.572247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.421335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.055812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
