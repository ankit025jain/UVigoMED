{"id":66442,"title":"Implementation of the Exeter enhanced recovery programme for patients undergoing radical cystectomy.","abstract":"To describe our experience with the implementation and refinement of an enhanced recovery programme (ERP) for radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion. To assess the impact on length of stay (LOS), complication and readmission rates.In all, 165 consecutive patients undergoing open RC (ORC) and urinary diversion between January 2008 and April 2013 were entered into an ERP. A retrospective case note review was undertaken. Outcomes recorded included LOS, time to mobilisation, complication rates within the first 30 days (Clavien-Dindo classification) and readmissions.All patients were successfully entered into the ERP. As enhanced recovery principles became embedded in the unit, LOS reduced from a mean of 14 days over the initial year of the ERP to a mean of 9.2 days. The complication rate was 6.6% for Clavien ?3, and 43.5% for Clavien ?2. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.2%. The 30-day readmission rate was 13.9%. In the most contemporary subset of 52 patients: the median time after ORC to sit out of bed, mobilise and open bowels was day 1, 2 and 6, respectively.The ERP described for patients undergoing ORC appears to be safe. Benefits include early feeding, mobilisation and hospital discharge. The ERP will continue to develop with the incorporation of advancing evidence and technology, in particular the introduction of robot-assisted RC.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712746","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.306178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Exeter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Oil refinery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Catholic Church","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Enhanced oil recovery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Municipal corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_corporation"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Benefits (How I Met Your Mother)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefits_(How_I_Met_Your_Mother)"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Urinary diversion","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_diversion"}]}
