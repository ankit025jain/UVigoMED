{"id":75337,"title":"Alzheimer's disease in France: too many patients exposed to drug interactions involving cholinesterase inhibitors.","abstract":"A study based on data from the French national health insurance system, for the period 2003-2011, has shown that patients with Alzheimer's disease receiving a cholinesterase inhibitor were exposed to another drug that reduces the heart rate in about 44% of cases, a neuroleptic in 33% of cases, and an antimuscarinic for urinary problems in 8% of cases. Drugs for Alzheimer's disease expose patients to dangerous drug-drug interactions.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25121150","annotations":[{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.801314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Antipsychotic","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.594412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.576586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor","weight":0.518456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.444757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Cholinesterase","weight":0.370158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinesterase"},{"name":"Muscarinic antagonist","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_antagonist"},{"name":"France","weight":0.254955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.10335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"National health insurance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_health_insurance"}]}
