{"id":69555,"title":"Prostate cell lines as models for biomarker discovery: performance of current markers and the search for new biomarkers.","abstract":"Prostate cancer cell lines have been used in the search for biomarkers that are suitable for prostate cancer diagnosis. Unfortunately, many cell line studies have only involved single cell lines, partially characterized cell lines or were performed without controls, and this may have been detrimental to effective biomarker discovery. We have analyzed a panel of prostate cancer and nonmalignant control cell lines using current biomarkers and then investigated a set of prospective endosomal and lysosomal proteins to search for new biomarkers.Western blotting was used to define the amount of protein and specific molecular forms in cell extracts and culture media from a panel of nonmalignant (RWPE-1, PNT1a, PNT2) and prostate cancer (22RV1, CaHPV10, DU-145, LNCaP) cell lines. Gene expression was determined by qRT-PCR.HPV-18 transfected cell lines displayed a different pattern of protein and gene expression when compared to the other cell lines examined, suggesting that these cell lines may not be the most optimal for prostate cancer biomarker discovery. There was an increased amount of prostatic acid phosphatase and kallikrein proteins in LNCaP cell extracts and culture media, but variable amounts of these proteins in other prostate cancer cell lines. There were minimal differences in the amounts of lysosomal proteins detected in prostate cancer cells and culture media, but two endosomal proteins, cathepsin B and acid ceramidase, had increased gene and protein expression, and certain molecular forms showed increased secretion from prostate cancer cells (P???0.05). LIMP-2 gene and protein expression was significantly increased in prostate cancer compared to nonmalignant cell lines (P???0.05).While the existing prostate cancer biomarkers and lysosomal proteins investigated here were not able to specifically differentiate between a panel of nonmalignant and prostate cancer cell lines, endosomal proteins showed some discriminatory capacity. LIMP-2 is a critical regulator of endosome biogenesis and the increased expression observed in prostate cancer cells indicated that other endosome related proteins may also be upregulated and could be investigated as novel biomarkers.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Male Urogenital
