{"id":37662,"title":"Non-CpG hypermethylation in placenta of mutation-induced intrauterine growth restricted bovine foetuses.","abstract":"The existence of non-CpG methylation in mammalian DNA has mainly been observed in embryonic stem cells, but its functional significance is uncertain. We found an age-dependent non-CpG hypermethylation in DMR at the 3' end of the MIMT1 in the placenta of intrauterine growth restricted foetuses in cattle. Data suggest that this DMR play a role in epigenetic regulation of the PEG3 domain.
