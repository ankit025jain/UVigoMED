{"id":65332,"title":"A geometric model of plaque incision and graft for Peyronie's disease with geometric analyses of different techniques.","abstract":"A surgical approach with plaque incision and graft (PIG) to correct Peyronie's disease is the best method for complex, large deviations. However, the geometric and mechanical consequences of this intervention are poorly understood.The aim of this study was to analyze the geometric and mechanical consequences of PIG on penile straighten surgery.A tridimensional penile simile model with a curvature of 85Â° was created to test all of the most common PIG techniques. PIG with double-Y, H-shape, and Egydio techniques were used to rectify the curved penile model.The results that differed from a rectified cylinder shape were highlighted.All of the analyzed techniques created a geometric distortion that could be linked to poor surgical results. We suggest a new technique to resolve these abnormalities.Current techniques designed to correct penile deviation using PIG present geometric and mechanical imperfections with potential consequences to the postoperative success rate. The new technique proposed in this report could be a possible solution to solve the geometric distortion caused by PIG.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24866978","annotations":[{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.285637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Distortion","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Curvature","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Simile","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simile"},{"name":"PIG (musical project)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIG_(musical_project)"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Dimensional analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis"},{"name":"Platonic realism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_realism"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Arc length","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length"},{"name":"Distortion (optics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion_(optics)"},{"name":"Rectification (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectification_(geometry)"},{"name":"Commemorative plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commemorative_plaque"},{"name":"Large deviations theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_deviations_theory"},{"name":"Hair straightening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_straightening"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Geometric modeling","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_modeling"}]}
