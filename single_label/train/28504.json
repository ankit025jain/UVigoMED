{"id":28504,"title":"Course and moderators of emotional eating in anorectic and bulimic patients: a follow-up study.","abstract":"Emotion dysregulation has been found to be associated with specific eating attitudes and behavior in Eating Disorder (ED) patients. The present study evaluated whether emotional eating profile of ED patients changes over time and the possible effects of a psychotherapeutic intervention on the emotional eating dimension. One hundred and two ED patients (28 with Anorexia Nervosa restricting type [AN-R], 35 with Anorexia Nervosa binge/purging subtype [AN-B/P] and 39 with Bulimia Nervosa [BN]) were evaluated at baseline, at the end of a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, at 3 and 6 year follow-up. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV Axis I Disorders, the Emotional Eating Scale (EES) and several self-reported questionnaires for eating specific and general psychopathology were applied. A control group of 86 healthy subjects was also studied, in order to compare psychopathological variables at baseline. A significant EES total score reduction was observed among AN-B/P and BN patients, whereas no significant change was found in the AN-R group. Mixed Models analyses showed that a significant effect on EES total score variation was found for cocaine or amphetamine abuse (b = .25; p < .01). Patients who assumed these substances reported no significant EES reduction across time, unlike other patients. The present results suggest that ED patients with a history of cocaine or amphetamine abuse represent a sub-population of patients with lasting dysfunctional mood modulatory mechanisms.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854803","annotations":[{"name":"Amphetamine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"},{"name":"Bulimia nervosa","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulimia_nervosa"},{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Anorexia nervosa","weight":0.818507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Psychopathology","weight":0.796656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathology"},{"name":"Eating disorder","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder"},{"name":"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mood (psychology)","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.592859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Compulsive overeating","weight":0.589373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsive_overeating"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.584793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Axis I","weight":0.498285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_I"},{"name":"Eating","weight":0.437292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating"},{"name":"Anorectic","weight":0.419715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectic"},{"name":"Emotional dysregulation","weight":0.355432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.234657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Neuromodulation","weight":0.147108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.113624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Axis powers","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"}]}
