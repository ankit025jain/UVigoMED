{"id":89991,"title":"[Old pseudoarthrosis with large bone defect of the radius treated with the Watson-Jones technique: a case report].","abstract":"Large bone defects in the forearm pose a challenging reconstruction problem, especially when the condition has become chronic. The Watson-Jones technique is a relatively simple procedure that sacrifices pronation-supination, but allows the forearm to be used in everyday life. Here, we describe a unique case of one-bone forearm reconstruction for a patient who had been suffering from radius non-union for several years. This reconstruction technique provided the patient with acceptable function and appearance of the arm.
