{"id":42713,"title":"Acute pancreatitis associated with boceprevir: a case report.","abstract":"Approximately 170 million people are infected with hepatitis C, and the sustained virological response rate to treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin is 30-50%. In an attempt to improve the chances of cure, boceprevir is being added to therapy, but it is associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. We herein report a case of acute pancreatitis developed during treatment with pegylated interferon, ribavirin and boceprevir. Boceprevir was the most likely cause of drug-associated pancreatitis after the most common causes were ruled out, since this adverse event had not occurred when the patient had previously been exposed to pegylated interferon and ribavirin and there was no recurrence of the episode of pancreatitis when these two drugs were reintroduced. Acute pancreatitis is a rare adverse event associated with boceprevir therapy, but a potentially fatal event. Sequential determination of pancreatic enzymes should be considered during hepatitis C treatment with boceprevir.
