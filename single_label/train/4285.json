{"id":4285,"title":"[Congenital cholesteatoma of middle ear: 20 patients' clinical symptoms and imaging features].","abstract":"To investigate the location, staging, clinical symptoms, imaging features, and surgical treatment of the congenital cholesteatoma of middle ear (CCME).This was a retrospective review of 20 CCME cases.Of 20 cases with CCME, 2 cases were classified as Postic stage I, 0 as stage II, 13 as stage III, 5 as stage IV. Conductive hearing loss was the most common clinical symptom. The mean preoperative PTA was 54.1 dB, and the mean ABG was 41.7 dB. One case underwent a modified mastoidectomy and a second-stage ossicular reconstruction; 2 cases experienced a radical mastoidectomy without ossicular reconsturction for extensive cholesteatoma; 5 cases underwent modified mastoidectomy and a one-stage tympanoplasty, with one case diagnosed as congenital malformation of ossicular chain (stapes hypoplasia); other 12 cases underwent a one-stage tympanoplasty. The cholesteatoma localized to the posterior-epitympanum or mesotympanum in all patients, mainly located in the incudostapedial joint. The mean postoperative PTA from 16 cases was 35.3 dB, and A-B gap was 20.2 dB. All patients were followed-up for at least 1 year after operation and recurrence was found in 2 cases. Three cases were accompanied with congenital malformation of ossicular chain.CCME is a rare entity and diagnosis is usually delayed in clinical practice due to the silent nature of disease in its early stage. The prognosis of CCME mainly depended on the stage of the lesions.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464563","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.81151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.70383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.690269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.584929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.518382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.420478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.413105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Hypoplasia","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplasia"},{"name":"Cholesteatoma","weight":0.347222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesteatoma"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.182633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Stapes","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stapes"},{"name":"Conductive hearing loss","weight":0.113889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductive_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Tympanoplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanoplasty"},{"name":"Mastoidectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoidectomy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
