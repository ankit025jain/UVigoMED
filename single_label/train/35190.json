{"id":35190,"title":"Mesh repair of umbilical hernia without a visible abdominal scar.","abstract":"Experience in the use of Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery procedures and the persistent urge to improve the cosmetic effect have contributed to the introduction of mesh repair of an umbilical hernia by means of a small incision in the natural position of the umbilicus. The aim of the study was to present the surgical technique and assess its postoperative results.During the period between 24.08.2011 and 01.01.2013, twenty-three umbilical hernia repair operations with the use of a polypropylene mesh by means of a small incision in the natural position of the umbilicus were performed. The synthetic material was placed in the preperitoneal space. The wound was closed and the umbilicus was reconstructed simultaneously, in order to make the scar invisible. Cutaneous stitches were not used.The average duration of the operation was 49 minutes. In one case of an obese patient with coexisting linea alba dehiscence, hernia recurrence was observed. All wounds healed without complications. The cosmetic effect was very good.Based on the presented experience mesh repair of the umbilical hernia by means of a small incision in the natural position of the umbilicus contributes essential benefits, such as a very good cosmetic effect without consecutive increasing costs, as compared to standard treatment by means of an infraumbilical incision.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670336","annotations":[{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.819171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.754841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Navel","weight":0.706444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.600523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Polypropylene","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Synthetic fiber","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_fiber"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0994886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Hernia repair","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia_repair"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Linea alba (abdomen)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linea_alba_(abdomen)"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Umbilical hernia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_hernia"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Bond duration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_duration"},{"name":"Mesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Alba (poetry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba_(poetry)"},{"name":"Linguistic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Invisibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisibility"},{"name":"Outer space","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space"},{"name":"Linea","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linea"},{"name":"Wound dehiscence","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_dehiscence"}]}
