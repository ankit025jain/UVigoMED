{"id":92171,"title":"The Chinese language version of the abbreviated burn specific health scale: a validation study.","abstract":"The Burn Specific Health Scale (BSHS) is designed to measure burn-specific, health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the abbreviated BSHS (BSHS-A).The English version of the BSHS-A was translated into Chinese using a standardised procedure. The participants were 457 patients classified into three severity groups (mild, moderate and severe). All patients completed the Chinese BSHS-A questionnaire, the Short Form-36 (SF-36) and the EuroQol 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D). To evaluate clinical utility of the BSHS-A, we used Cronbach's alpha (internal consistency), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs; test-retest reliability) and construct validity (using the SF-36 and EQ-5D).Cronbach's alpha for all subscales was >0.80, demonstrating high internal consistency of the BSHS-A (Chinese version). The ICC was >0.70 for each patient group. Strong correlations were observed between the BSHS-A and SF-36 and EQ-5D scales. Neither floor nor ceiling effects were found.The present study demonstrated that the BSHS-A (Chinese version) has good psychometric properties, showing suitable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The BSHS-A may, thus, be useful for assessing HRQoL in Chinese burn victims. However, adaptations may be required to reduce its length.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439926","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.711976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.693367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.645987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.632415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.543349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Chinese language","weight":0.442487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language"},{"name":"Construct validity","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_validity"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.32253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"China","weight":0.247605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.234308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intraclass correlation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraclass_correlation"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"International Cricket Council","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"},{"name":"Equalization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization"},{"name":"Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video"},{"name":"Level of measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement"},{"name":"Ceiling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceiling"},{"name":"Clinical utility of diagnostic tests","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_utility_of_diagnostic_tests"},{"name":"Abbreviation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
