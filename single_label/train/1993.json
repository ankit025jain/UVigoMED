{"id":1993,"title":"The effect of lateral internal sphincterotomy on resting anal sphincter pressures.","abstract":"Anal fissures are one of the most common proctologic disorders. This study aimed to investigate alterations in anal sphincteric resting pressures after lateral internal sphincterotomy, which was performed for chronic anal fissure treatment.Fifty-six (68.3%) male and 26 (31.7%) female patients were included in this study. Patients complicated with fistula-in-ano, abscess, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, dermatitis, poor general condition, allergy to any of the standard medications, previous history of anal trauma, previous anal surgery, or diagnosis of a neurological disease and patients who did not give consent to the trial were excluded from the study. Two groups were formed: a control group with 41 healthy volunteers and a study group with 41 chronic anal fissure patients. Preoperative and postoperative manometric anal measurements were compared.Preoperative mean resting anal sphincter pressure was 51.29 mmHg for the control group and was 59.99 mmHg for the patient group. Although resting anal sphincteric pressures of the patient group remained within the physiological range, when compared with the control group there was a statistically significant difference. Postoperative mean resting anal sphincteric pressures of the patient group was 32.43 mmHg.Lateral internal sphincterotomy decreases resting anal sphincter pressures effectively in chronic anal fissure patients.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25551944","annotations":[{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.808582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.782675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.703266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.673924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Anal fissure","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_fissure"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.242337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.179231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Pressure measurement","weight":0.102205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_measurement"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Anal sex","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex"},{"name":"Lateral internal sphincterotomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_internal_sphincterotomy"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Fissure","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissure"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Anal sphincterotomy","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sphincterotomy"}]}
