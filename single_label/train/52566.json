{"id":52566,"title":"[Factors affecting the quality of life of elderly diabetic patients: survey in north and south Wanjiang river regions].","abstract":"To investigate the quality of life of elderly diabetic patients and its influencing factors.By randomized cluster sampling, we conducted a survey in 1450 elderly residents (over 60 years old) living in urban, suburban and rural areas in south and north Anhui province. We evaluated the quality of life of the elderly diabetic patients using a demographic information questionnaire and full items on Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36).The elderly diabetic patients had lower scores in all dimensions of quality of life than the elderly without diabetes. Multiple linear regression analysis showed a linear regression in the quality of life among the elderly diabetic patients in terms of geographic regions, education, personality, sleep quality, and age.Elderly diabetic patients have generally poor quality of life, which was subjected to the influences by geographic regions, education, personality, sleep quality, and age, suggesting the necessity of corresponding interventions to improve the quality of life of these patients.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589614","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.642039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.46328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.451083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.34327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Personality psychology","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.200698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.184698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Suburb","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb"},{"name":"River","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River"},{"name":"Cluster sampling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_sampling"},{"name":"Anhui","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"1450","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1450"},{"name":"Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"}]}
