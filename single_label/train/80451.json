{"id":80451,"title":"Maternal schistosomiasis alters costimulatory molecules expression in antigen-presenting cells from adult offspring mice.","abstract":"Adult offspring of Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice showed alterations in immunity to a heterologous antigen, ovalbumin (OA). Prior breastfeeding induced increased production of anti-OA antibodies, while pregnancy impaired it. Here, we investigated the expression of costimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of the adult offspring of S. mansoni-infected mothers in response to OA. Newborn mice were divided into three groups: animals Born Infected Mothers (BIM) suckled by non-infected mothers; animals from non-infected mothers Suckled Infected Mothers (SIM); and another group of mice born from and suckled by non-infected mothers (CONTROL). The adult offspring were immunized with subcutaneous OA+adjuvant, and 3-8days following immunization, double labeling was performed (CD45R/B220 or CD11c and CD80, CD86, CD40 or HLA-DR) on spleen cells. In comparison to the CONTROL group, an early increased frequency of CD40+/CD80+ B cells was observed in SIM mice (p<0.001/p<0.05), but no alteration of CD11c+ cells was observed. In contrast, in BIM mice, the frequency of CD86+/CD11c+ cells (p<0.05) and CD40+/CD80+/CD86+ B cells (p<0.01/p<0.01/p<0.05) was drastically reduced. In conclusion, previous suckling by S. mansoni-infected mothers enabled improved antigen presentation by B cells in adult offspring, whereas gestation in these mothers imprinted offspring with weak antigen presentation by APCs during the immune response to a non-related antigen.
