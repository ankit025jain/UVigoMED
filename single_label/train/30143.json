{"id":30143,"title":"Mitomycin C and capecitabine in pretreated patients with metastatic gastric cancer: a multicenter phase II study.","abstract":"We conducted a multicenter phase II study to assess the toxicity and efficacy of a combination of mitomycin C (MMC) and capecitabine in pretreated patients with metastatic or locally advanced gastric cancer.Thirty-nine patients (77 % male) between 33 and 78 years (median 66) with pretreated locally advanced or metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma and eastern cooperative oncology group performance status of ?2, measurable lesions, and adequate organ functions were recruited into the study. Eight patients (21 %) had received more than one prior chemotherapy regimen. Treatment consisted of three-weekly MMC 10 mg/m(2) day 1 and capecitabine 2,000 mg/m(2) (day 1-14; repeated day 22).A median of three cycles of therapy was administered. Grade 3 toxicity occurred in 20 patients (54 %). Main grade 3 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (11 %, n = 4), fatigue (8 %, n = 3), and neuropathy (8 %, n = 3). Two events of grade 4 toxicity were reported (5 %) (dyspnea and elevation of alkaline phosphatase due to bone metastases). Partial remission was noticed in 10.3 % (n = 4), stable disease in 33.3 % (n = 13) adding to a tumor control rate of 43.6 %. The median progression-free and overall survival were 2.8 and 5.6 months, respectively.The combination of MMC and capecitabine exhibited a favorable tolerability profile in pretreated patients with gastric cancer. The disease control rate compares adequately with that of other phase II and phase III trials for second-line therapy in gastric cancer. This regimen may be considered as an alternative second-line treatment, especially for patients not suitable for or pretreated with taxanes and/or irinotecan.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556803","annotations":[{"name":"Mitomycin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitomycin"},{"name":"Irinotecan","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irinotecan"},{"name":"Capecitabine","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capecitabine"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.746321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.737248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Bone metastasis","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Taxane","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxane"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.725586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.700939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.694209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.626846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.5491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.455046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.387715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.350474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.330134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0230596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
