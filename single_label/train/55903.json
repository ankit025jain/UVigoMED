{"id":55903,"title":"A comparative effectiveness analysis of visual field outcomes after projected glaucoma screening using SD-OCT in African American communities.","abstract":"To assess the impact on visual function of community glaucoma screening in an African American population using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).Using a Monte Carlo microsimulation model with a 10-year time horizon, we analyzed the efficacy of SD-OCT screening on visual field outcomes in a population of African Americans who are not otherwise seeking office-based care. Outcomes included classification of visual field severity, quality-adjusted life years, and direct health care costs.Assuming a 60% follow-up rate, screening decreased the prevalence of undiagnosed glaucoma from 75% to 38%, and decreased the prevalence of severe visual field loss in patients with glaucoma from 29.1% to 23.9%. Conversely, screening increased the prevalence of mild visual field loss in patients with glaucoma from 9.2% to 18.7%. From initial screening through confirmatory eye examination, the screening program (\"screen only\") cost $98 per screened individual, and $2561 per new diagnosis of glaucoma. When considering the costs of initial screening though the resultant treatment, the screening program (\"screen and treat\") had an average annual cost of $79 and $2138, respectively, over a 10-year time period. The cost of one quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by screening, including management and treatment, in comparison with opportunistic case finding, ranged from $46,416 to $67,813.Our findings suggest that community SD-OCT screening in an African American population will minimize glaucoma-related visual morbidity. Ideally, strategies to maximize treatment efficacy through improved medication adherence and improved compliance with follow-up should be identified and implemented before instituting a screening program.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24787570","annotations":[{"name":"African
