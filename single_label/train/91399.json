{"id":91399,"title":"The importance of polysomnography in the evaluation of prolonged disorders of consciousness: sleep recordings more adequately correlate than stimulus-related evoked potentials with patients' clinical status.","abstract":"The aim of our study was to evaluate the importance of sleep recordings and stimulus-related evoked potentials (EPs) in patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness (DOCs) by correlating neurophysiologic variables with clinical evaluation obtained using specific standardized scales.There were 27 vegetative state (VS) and 5 minimally conscious state (MCS) patients who were evaluated from a clinical and neurophysiologic perspective. Clinical evaluation included the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R), Disability Rating Scale (DRS), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Neurophysiologic evaluation included 24-h polysomnography (PSG), somatosensory EPs (SEPs), brainstem auditory EPs (BAEPs), and visual EPs (VEPs).Patients with preservation of each single sleep element (sleep-wake cycle, sleep spindles, K-complexes, and rapid eye movement [REM] sleep) always showed better clinical scores compared to those who did not have preservation. Statistical significance was only achieved for REM sleep. In 7 patients PSG showed the presence of all considered sleep elements, and they had a CRS-R score of 8.29±1.38. In contrast, 25 patients who lacked one or more of the sleep elements had a CRS-R score of 4.84±1.46 (P<.05). Our multivariate analysis clarified that concurrent presence of sleep spindles and REM sleep were associated with a much higher CRS-R score (positive interaction, P<.0001). On the other hand, no significant associations were found between EPs and CRS-R scores.PSG recordings have proved to be a reliable tool in the neurophysiologic assessment of patients with prolonged DOCs, correlating more adequately than EPs with the clinical evaluation and the level of consciousness. The main contribution to higher clinical scores was determined by the concomitant presence of REM sleep and sleep spindles. PSG recordings may be considered inexpensive, noninvasive, and easy-to-perform examinations to provide supplementary information in patients with prolonged DOCs.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508049","annotations":[{"name":"Glasgow Coma Scale","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale"},{"name":"Rapid eye movement sleep","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep"},{"name":"Minimally conscious state","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimally_conscious_state"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.785161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Evoked potential","weight":0.548361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.543093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Neurophysiology","weight":0.518451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophysiology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.476316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.373701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Persistent vegetative state","weight":0.366935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_vegetative_state"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.348417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.304237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Eye movement (sensory)","weight":0.271471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_(sensory)"},{"name":"Sleep spindle","weight":0.198912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_spindle"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Altered level of consciousness","weight":0.155638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_level_of_consciousness"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.138717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
