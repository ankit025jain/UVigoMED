{"id":76440,"title":"Dietary sodium restriction decreases insulin secretion without affecting insulin sensitivity in humans.","abstract":"Interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system prevents incident diabetes in high-risk individuals, although the mechanism remains unclear.To test the hypothesis that activation of the endogenous renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or exogenous aldosterone impairs insulin secretion in humans.We conducted a randomized, blinded crossover study of aldosterone vs vehicle and compared the effects of a low-sodium versus a high-sodium diet.Academic clinical research center.Healthy, nondiabetic, normotensive volunteers.Infusion of exogenous aldosterone (0.7 ?g/kg/h for 12.5 h) or vehicle during low or high sodium intake. Low sodium (20 mmol/d; n = 12) vs high sodium (160 mmol/d; n = 17) intake for 5-7 days.Change in acute insulin secretory response assessed during hyperglycemic clamps while in sodium balance during a low-sodium vs high-sodium diet during aldosterone vs vehicle.A low-sodium diet increased endogenous aldosterone and plasma renin activity, and acute glucose-stimulated insulin (-16.0 ± 5.6%; P = .007) and C-peptide responses (-21.8 ± 8.4%; P = .014) were decreased, whereas the insulin sensitivity index was unchanged (-1.0 ± 10.7%; P = .98). Aldosterone infusion did not affect the acute insulin response (+1.8 ± 4.8%; P = .72) or insulin sensitivity index (+2.0 ± 8.8%; P = .78). Systolic blood pressure and serum potassium were similar during low and high sodium intake and during aldosterone infusion.Low dietary sodium intake reduces insulin secretion in humans, independent of insulin sensitivity.","date":"2014-10-04","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029426","annotations":[{"name":"Aldosterone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Renin","weight":0.788913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renin"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.714865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.633837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.613709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.473251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.44291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.107121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0127581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"}]}
