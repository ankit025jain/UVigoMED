{"id":26666,"title":"Surgical management of thoracoabdominal aneurysms.","abstract":"Thoracoabdominal aneurysm of the aorta (TAAA) is a morbid condition, the treatment of which can be associated with high mortality and complication rates, as well as prolonged length of hospital stay. Currently, three approaches to treatment of TAAAs exist: open, endovascular and hybrid repair. Over the past three decades, a significant decrease in postoperative mortality and paraplegia rates has been achieved due to effective application of such treatment adjuncts as left heart bypass, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, application of hypothermia and neuromonitoring, thereby making surgical treatment of TAAAs increasingly safer for the patient. In this report, we review indications and current approaches to surgical management of TAAAs, as well as the factors that influence the efficacy of this type of treatment.","date":"2014-12-31","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092876","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Paraplegia","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraplegia"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.619996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.577121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.22181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.118236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Adjuncts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuncts"},{"name":"Left heart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_heart"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraoperative_neurophysiological_monitoring"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
