{"id":4731,"title":"Comparison of fracture resistance in post restorations in primary maxillary incisors.","abstract":"This in vitro study aimed to test the fracture resistance of 4 different posts used in the restoration of severely decayed primary incisors.Fifty primary incisors were selected for this study and sectioned 1 mm above the CEJ. After filing and irrigation of the root canal space, the canals were obturated with Metapex and 3 mm of post space was prepared inside the canals. Intact glass fiber posts, split-ended glass fiber posts, composite resin posts, and orthodontic ? 'gamma' wire posts were used as intracanal posts and the final composite resin restoration was placed using a paediatric strip crown. After thermocycling of the specimens, the fracture resistance was measured using a universal testing machine.The mean fracture resistance of split- ended glass fiber posts was higher than the other groups, however, there was no significant difference between any of the groups (P>0.05).Split-ended glass fiber posts seem to be a more appropriate option for full coverage restorations in primary incisors.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306151","annotations":[{"name":"Resin","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Fiberglass","weight":0.566734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.292374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Root canal","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_canal"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.236682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Dental composite","weight":0.221729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_composite"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.183573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.119542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Thermal cycler","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_cycler"},{"name":"Universal testing machine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_testing_machine"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Intact Media Group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intact_Media_Group"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0151736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Involuntary commitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_commitment"},{"name":"Cementoenamel junction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cementoenamel_junction"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
