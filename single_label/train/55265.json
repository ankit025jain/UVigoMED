{"id":55265,"title":"Combined topical application of a regenerative agent with a bandage contact lens for the treatment of persistent epithelial defects.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to report 3 cases of persistent epithelial defects (PEDs) successfully treated with the combined topical application of a regenerative agent (RGTA; Cacicol20, OTR3, Paris, France) with a bandage contact lens (BCL).This is a case series.Three patients suffering from a PED for 4-8 weeks and unresponsive to conventional therapy were treated with the combined application of an RGTA (Cacicol20) and a silicone hydrogel BCL. The PED healed in all patients after 4-21 days, and no side effects were noted.The combination of an RGTA (Cacicol20) with a BCL seems to be an effective treatment for PED.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24937169","annotations":[{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"France","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Contact lens","weight":0.669436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens"},{"name":"Paris","weight":0.668373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.620168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.544231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bandage","weight":0.352099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandage"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Lens (anatomy)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0382772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Bachelor of Civil Law","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Civil_Law"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Off-the-Record Messaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging"},{"name":"Talent agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent"},{"name":"Performance-enhancing drugs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance-enhancing_drugs"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"}]}
