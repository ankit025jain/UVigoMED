{"id":33063,"title":"Updates in medical and surgical therapies for Tourette syndrome.","abstract":"Tourette syndrome is a complex neurobehavioral disorder defined by multiple motor and at least 1 vocal tic, persisting over 1Â year, waxing and waning in severity, and not explained by another condition. The condition may range from mild nuisance to debilitating and disabling in severity. Management includes counseling and reassurance, behavioral interventions, pharmacologic, and rarely, surgical interventions. Traditionally, alpha-2 agonists and dopamine receptor antagonists have been utilized. In addition, a number of different pharmacotherapies have been implemented in the search for improved management of tics with better tolerability. In rare, severely disabling cases, neuromodulation with deep brain stimulation may be indicated. Optimal brain targets and candidate selection are still in evolution. This article will review the evidence for current medical and surgical therapies with a focus on recent updates.
