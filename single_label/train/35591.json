{"id":35591,"title":"The natural history of egg allergy in an observational cohort.","abstract":"There are few studies on the natural history of egg allergy, and most are single-site and nonlongitudinal and have not identified early predictors of outcomes.We sought to describe the natural course of egg allergy and to identify early prognostic markers.Children age 3 to 15 months were enrolled in a multicenter observational study with either (1) a convincing history of an immediate allergic reaction to egg, milk, or both with a positive skin prick test (SPT) response to the trigger food and/or (2) moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and a positive SPT response to egg or milk. Children enrolled with a clinical history of egg allergy were followed longitudinally, and resolution was established based on successful ingestion.The cohort with egg allergy consists of 213 children followed to a median age of 74 months. Egg allergy resolved in 105 (49.3%) children at a median age of 72 months. Factors that were most predictive of resolution included the following: initial reaction characteristics (isolated urticaria/angioedema vs other presentations), baseline egg-specific IgE level, egg SPT wheal size, atopic dermatitis severity, IgG4 level, and IL-4 response (all P < .05). Numerous additional baseline clinical and demographic factors and laboratory assessments were not associated with resolution. Multivariate analysis identified baseline egg-specific IgE levels and initial reaction characteristics as strongly associated with resolution; a calculator to estimate resolution probabilities using these variables was established.In this cohort of infants with egg allergy, approximately one half had resolved over 74 months of follow-up. Baseline egg-specific IgE levels and initial reaction characteristics were important predictors of the likelihood of resolution.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636473","annotations":[{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.809608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.661005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.616108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.578215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.565546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.560422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.509985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.406655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.371952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Egg allergy","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_allergy"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.26305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0901231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Egg (food)","weight":0.0677712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Longitudinal engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_engine"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Trigger (firearms)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_(firearms)"},{"name":"Natural history of disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history_of_disease"},{"name":"Calculator","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator"},{"name":"Strathclyde Partnership for Transport","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathclyde_Partnership_for_Transport"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
