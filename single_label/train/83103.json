{"id":83103,"title":"Evaluation of the non-functional tooth contact in patients with temporomandibular disorders by using newly developed electronic system.","abstract":"The aims of this study were to introduce a novel electronic system for reliable evaluation of the non-functional tooth contact in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and investigate the possible associations between the non-functional tooth contact and some characteristics of the patients with TMD. We designed and installed a software program to send emails regarding the non-functional tooth contact to the subjects' preregistered cellular phones at intervals of 20 ± 9 min daily for 10 consecutive days. Twelve patients with TMD and 12 gender- and age-matched healthy subjects responded via emails to one of 3 choices: no tooth contact, tooth contact during oral functions or tooth contact not associated with oral functions. The influence of subjective stress, anxiety, depression, personality and daily activities on tooth contact was then assessed. The frequency of the non-functional tooth contact was significantly higher in the patients with TMD than in the healthy subjects (35·0% vs. 9·6%, P < 0·001), while no significant group difference was found for the frequency of functional tooth contact, the stress, anxiety, depression and personality.
