{"id":41659,"title":"Administration of secretin (RG1068) increases the sensitivity of detection of duct abnormalities by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in patients with pancreatitis.","abstract":"Administration of secretin improves noninvasive imaging of the pancreatic duct with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). We performed a large prospective study to investigate whether synthetic human secretin (RG1068)-stimulated MRCP detects pancreatic duct abnormalities with higher levels of sensitivity than MRCP.We performed a phase 3, multicenter, baseline-controlled study of patients with acute or acute recurrent pancreatitis who were scheduled to undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) between March 26, 2008, and October 28, 2009. Patients underwent a baseline MRCP that was immediately followed by administration of RG1068 and repeat MRCP and then underwent ERCP within 30 days; they were followed up for 30 days. MRCP and ERCP images were read centrally by 3 radiologists and 2 endoscopists, respectively, who were all independent and blinded; pancreatic duct abnormalities were evaluated. The accuracy of MRCP was evaluated using ERCP as the standard.In total, 258 patients were enrolled in the study; 251 MRCP image sets were assessed, and 236 patients had evaluable ERCPs. Pancreatic duct abnormalities were observed in 60.2% of ERCP images. All radiologists identified duct abnormalities in RG1068-cin√© MRCP image sets with significantly higher levels of sensitivity (P < .0001) than in images from MRCP, with minimal loss of specificity. Adverse events were reported in 38.0% of patients after MRCP and 68.1% after ERCP. Of the 55 patients who experienced a serious adverse event, 3 (1.2%) and 52 (20.5%) of the events were reported to be temporally associated with MRCP and ERCP, respectively. The adverse events most frequently considered related to RG1068 were nausea, abdominal pain, and flushing; most were mild.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906040","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.80179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Secretin","weight":0.702561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretin"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.628796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.508554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.2457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Flushing (physiology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing_(physiology)"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
