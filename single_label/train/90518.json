{"id":90518,"title":"[Treatment of child back to back ultra-radius distal fracture by percutaneous reduction with Kirschner wire and external plaster fixation].","abstract":"To study the effect of Kirschner wire percutanous reduction and plaster external fixation for treatment of childern distal ulna-radius fractures.From July 2010 to March 2012,37 children with distal ulna-radius fracture were treated by Kirschner wire percutanous reduction and plaster external fixation including 24 males and 13 females with an average age of 9.5 years old ranging from 6 to 13 years old. The course was 4 h to 3 d. The cause of fracture was all fall from height without other associated injuries.All patients were followed up from 1 to 6 months. The bone union times were from 21 to 42 d (means 31.5 d). All patients obtained bone union. No case has malunion. No case was received surgical operation. According to the Berton Scales,the result was excellent in 14 cases,good in 20 cases,fair in 3 cases.Using Kirschner wire percutaneous reduction and plaster external fixation can achieve an effective reduction and fixation, which make the patients to exercise the upper extremity function as early as possible.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605753","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.353665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.303328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Plaster","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Kirschner wire","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirschner_wire"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Marc Kirschner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Kirschner"},{"name":"Back-to-back houses","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-back_houses"},{"name":"Henri Montan Berton","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Montan_Berton"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"}]}
