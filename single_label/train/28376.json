{"id":28376,"title":"Pharmacogenovigilance: a pharmacogenomics pharmacovigilance program.","abstract":"In this report, we review the importance of pharmacovigilance in detecting postmarketing adverse drug events and the potential for developing pharmacogenovigilance programs by integrating pharmacogenomics with pharmacovigilance. We propose to start developing such a program in primary healthcare systems that use basic features of electronic medical records and have access to large numbers of patients commonly prescribed drugs. Such programs, if carefully designed, may grow over time and hopefully enhance the collection and interpretation of useful data for the clinical applications of pharmacogenomics testing.
