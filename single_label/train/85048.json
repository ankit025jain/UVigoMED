{"id":85048,"title":"Novel tests for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with underlying respiratory diseases.","abstract":"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis has been increasingly reported in nonneutropenic patients, including those with underlying respiratory diseases.We compared the diagnostic performances of galactomannan, 1,3-?-D-glucan, and Aspergillus-specific lateral-flow device tests with that of conventional culture by using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from patients with underlying respiratory diseases.We analyzed 268 bronchoalveolar lavage samples from 221 patients with underlying respiratory diseases (and without hematologic malignancy or previous solid organ transplantation) that were collected for routine microbiological workup between February 2012 and May 2014 at the University Hospital of Graz, Austria. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was defined according to European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria modified for patients with respiratory diseases.Thirty-one patients (14%) had probable or proven, 25 possible, and the remaining 165 patients no invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Probable/proven aspergillosis was associated with a significantly higher (P = 0.034) 30-day mortality rate of 32%. Sensitivities, specificities, and diagnostic odd ratios differed markedly between galactomannan (cut-off 0.5: optical density index, 0.97, 0.81, 124.4; cut-off 1.0: 0.97, 0.93, 422.1; cut-off 3.0: 0.61, 0.99, 109.8), ?-D-glucan (cut-off 80 pg/ml: 0.90, 0.42, 6.57; cut-off 200 pg/ml: 0.70, 0.61, 3.7), lateral-flow device tests (0.77, 0.92, 41.8), and mycological culture (0.29, 0.97, 14).","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25203869","annotations":[{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.744486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.714493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.65973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Austria","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.584469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.473664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.43271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Aspergillosis","weight":0.370962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillosis"},{"name":"Mycology","weight":0.259241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycology"},{"name":"Absorbance","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Graz","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graz"},{"name":"Galactomannan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactomannan"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Formula One","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"268","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/268"},{"name":"Parity (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Study Group International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_Group_International"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
