{"id":42128,"title":"[Efficacy and safety of valdoxan in patients with irritable bowel syndrome].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the antidepressant valdoxan in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with comorbid mild and moderate depression.Twenty-eight patients with IBS and depression without psychotic symptoms were studied using clinical examination and psychometric scales.A significant reduction in psychopathological symptoms, along with the improvement of health status, was recorded for most patients treated with valdoxan (25-50 mg/night) in the end of the 1st week.Valdoxan has a good tolerability and safety profile, does not exert any negative effect on the IBS course and provides a high level of compliance.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24874326","annotations":[{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.800148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.77453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.755699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.755043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Psychosis","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.451808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.432491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Psychopathology","weight":0.280861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathology"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.186427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0940019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Liberalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"}]}
