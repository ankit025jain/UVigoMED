{"id":45175,"title":"Serum endocan levels are increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.","abstract":"Endocan is a marker of angiogenesis previously studied in various types of cancer and inflammatory conditions. Its expression is influenced by vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF A) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), cytokines involved in pathogenetic pathways in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to determine whether serum endocan levels were increased in IBD patients.We conducted an exploratory pilot study. Serum endocan levels were determined in a group of 33 consecutive IBD patients from an observational cohort study ongoing at Colentina Hospital and compared to levels determined in two control groups: healthy controls and stage IV cancer patients.Endocan levels were significantly higher in the IBD group as compared to both healthy controls (p < 0.001) and cancer patients (p < 0.01). There was no correlation found between endocan levels and disease activity as assessed by clinical or endoscopical activity scores.There is a potential role for endocan in future biomarker studies in IBD patients.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697130","annotations":[{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.880709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.638165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.592141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.55588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.504919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.41588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.296326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.154458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"}]}
