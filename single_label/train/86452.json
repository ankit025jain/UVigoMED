{"id":86452,"title":"Clinical outcomes and complications associated with TORS for OSAHS: a benchmark for evaluating an emerging surgical technology in a targeted application for benign disease.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to create benchmarks for evaluating clinical outcomes and complications of transoral robotic surgeries (TORS) in a multicenter setting.243 TORS for obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) operations, carried out between 2008 and 2012, were analyzed at 7 different centers. The average hospitalization was 3.5 days. The mean patient age was 50 ± 12 years, the average BMI at the time of the procedure was 28.53 ± 3.87 and the majority of the patients were men (81%).The mean preoperative and postoperative apnea/hypopnea index was 43.0 ± 22.6 and 17.9 ± 18.4, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean preoperative and postoperative Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 12.34 ± 5.19 and 5.7 ± 3.49, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean pre- and postoperative lowest O2 saturation was 79.5 ± 8.77 and 83.9 ± 6.38%, respectively (p < 0.001).Patients undergoing TORS as part of a multilevel approach for the treatment of OSAHS have a reasonable expectation of success with minimal long-term morbidity.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777053","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.664622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.592737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.522637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.487161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Somnolence","weight":0.449015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.354108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.206273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Epworth Sleepiness Scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epworth_Sleepiness_Scale"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Expected value","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Benchmarking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Epworth, Lincolnshire","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epworth,_Lincolnshire"}]}
