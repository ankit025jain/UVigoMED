{"id":9539,"title":"Estimated prevalence and risk factors associated with clinical Lumpy skin disease in north-eastern Ethiopia.","abstract":"Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is one of the major livestock disease problems in most areas of Ethiopia. A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2011 to February 2012 in four selected districts of Afar and Tigray regions to estimate the herd-level prevalence of LSD, and to assess its associated risk factors. Herd-owners were selected based on the willingness to provide information to complete the questionnaire. A total of 393 questionnaires were collected. Out of 393 herd-owners, 173 reported having LSD in their herds, giving an estimated herd- and animal-level prevalence of (44%, 95% CI: 37-50%) and (7.4%, 95% CI: 6-8%), respectively. Herd prevalence between regions and among the districts were significantly different (?(2)=8, P<0.01 and ?(2)=9.9, P<0.01), respectively. The risk factors of LSD occurrence were introduction of a new animal to the herd, herd size, and utilization of communal grazing and watering points. These management characteristics cannot be readily changed in the studied area, hence, disease control should rely on a greater use of effective LSD vaccines.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703247","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Ethiopia","weight":0.689554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.562384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Livestock","weight":0.476844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.389795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Grazing","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grazing"},{"name":"Lysergic acid diethylamide","weight":0.090579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Tigray Province","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigray_Province"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"393","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/393"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Northeastern United States (U.S. Census Bureau)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States_(U.S._Census_Bureau)"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Afar people","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afar_people"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
