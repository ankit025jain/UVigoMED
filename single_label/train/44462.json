{"id":44462,"title":"Inhibition of water activated by far infrared functional ceramics on proliferation of hepatoma cells.","abstract":"Rare earth (RE)/tourmaline composite materials prepared by the precipitation method are added to the ceramic raw materials at a certain percentage and sintered into RE functional ceramics with high far infrared emission features. Then the far infrared functional ceramics are used to interact with water. The influence of the ceramics on the physical parameters of water is investigated, and the effect of the activated water on the growth of Bel-7402 hepatoma cells cultured in vitro is further studied. The results indicate that, compared with the raw water, the water activated by the ceramics can inhibit the proliferation of hepatoma cells, with statistical probability P < 0.01, which means that the effect is significant. It can be explained that the water activated by the ceramics has a higher concentration of H+, which decreases the potential difference across the cell membrane to release the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). After entering the cells, the activated water stimulates the mitochondria to produce immune substances that lead tumor cells to apoptosis.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24734643","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.715278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.707337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.65001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.649595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.490218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.455443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Voltage","weight":0.411106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.387952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Sintering","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintering"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Emission spectrum","weight":0.34962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.340679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Earth","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Ceramic","weight":0.256229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Rare earth element","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_earth_element"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Precipitation (meteorology)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.10613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.100036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Apoptosis-inducing factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis-inducing_factor"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Raw material","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
