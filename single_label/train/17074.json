{"id":17074,"title":"Solid organ transplant donors with central nervous system infection.","abstract":"While donor-derived infections (DDI) remain uncommon, multiple reports describe DDI with pathogens that cause central nervous system (CNS) infection resulting in significant recipient disease. The Ad Hoc Disease Transmission Advisory Committee (DTAC) reviewed the records of potential donor-derived disease transmission events (PDDTE) to describe donor characteristics and outcomes associated with DDI from CNS pathogens.All PDDTE reported from January 2008 to September 2010 were reviewed for characteristics suggesting CNS infection in the donor or the recipient. Identified cases were further examined to determine if donor CNS infection resulted in recipient infection.Ninety-one PDDTE cases in which there was concern for CNS infection in the donor or recipient were identified. Further review confirmed CNS infection in 12 donors, six of whom transmitted infection to 10 of 15 exposed recipients with five recipient deaths. Pathogens included Balamuthia mandrillaris, Cryptococcus neoformans, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and West Nile virus. Listed cause of death at procurement for these donors included stroke, anoxia, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and meningoencephalitis. Confounding diagnoses were present in 6 of 12 donors that would have allowed them to be considered at low risk of transmitting a CNS pathogen. Of the six donors with no confounding conditions, three exhibited at least two suspicious \"DTAC warning criteria\" for CNS infection.Careful clinical assessment of donors combined with a high index of suspicion for ambiguous or misleading findings associated with CNS infection can reduce, but not eliminate, DDI with CNS pathogens.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24914569","annotations":[{"name":"Cryptococcus neoformans","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcus_neoformans"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"West Nile virus","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Nile_virus"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Meningoencephalitis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningoencephalitis"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.741139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.736517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.704098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis","weight":0.623093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_disseminated_encephalomyelitis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.542802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cryptococcus","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcus"},{"name":"Lymphocytic choriomeningitis","weight":0.207246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytic_choriomeningitis"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.18786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Encephalomyelitis","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalomyelitis"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.113871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"List of infections of the central nervous system","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_infections_of_the_central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Nile","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Transmitter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter"},{"name":"Ad hoc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"}]}
