{"id":62290,"title":"[MIP-1? promotes the migration ability of Jurkat cell through human brain microvascular endothelial cell monolayer].","abstract":"This study was purposed to explore the mechanism of central nervous system (CNS) leukemia resulting from brain metastasis of human acute T-cell leukemia (T-ALL) cells and the role of MIP-1? in migration of Jurkat cells through human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). The real-time PCR, siRNA test, transendothelial migration test, endothelial permeability assay and cell adhesion assay were used to detect MIP-1? expression, penetration and migration ability as well as adhesion capability respectively. The results showed that the MIP-1? expression in Jurkat cells was higher than that in normal T cells and CCRF-HSB2, CCRF-CEM , SUP-T1 cells. The MIP-1? secreted from Jurkat cells enhanced the ability of Jurkat cells to penetrate through HBMEC, the ability of Jurkat cells treated by MIP-1? siRNA to adhere to HBMEC and to migrate trans endothelial cells decreased. It is concluded that the MIP-1? secreted from Jurkat cells participates in process of penetrating the Jurkat cells through HBMEC monolayer.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598647","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.918038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.807742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Human brain","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.73345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.715511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Brain metastasis","weight":0.641196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_metastasis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.598665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.439905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.137589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.0853941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"}]}
