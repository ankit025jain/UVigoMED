{"id":53749,"title":"Sphingosine 1-phosphate: a potential molecular target for ovarian cancer therapy?","abstract":"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an important signaling regulator involved in tumor progression in multiple neoplasms. However, the role of S1P in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer remains unclear. Herein, we summarize recent advances in understanding the impact of S1P signaling in ovarian cancer progression. S1P, aberrantly produced in ovarian cancer patients, is involved in the regulation of key cellular processes that contribute to ovarian cancer initiation and progression. Moreover, agents that block the S1P signaling pathway inhibit ovarian cancer cell growth or induce apoptosis. Hence, current evidence suggests that S1P may become a potential molecular target for ovarian cancer therapy.
