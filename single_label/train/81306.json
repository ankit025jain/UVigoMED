{"id":81306,"title":"Physiologic neuromuscular dental paradigm for the diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular disorders.","abstract":"Shifting from traditional anatomical/mechanistic models, the physiologic neuromuscular dentistry (PNMD) paradigm acknowledges the primacy of physiology in shaping and controlling anatomy in a functioning human body. Occlusal disharmony from mandibular discrepancy to cranium leads to temporomandibular disorders (TMD), which is a disease of musculoskeletal imbalance in the postural chain exceeding the individual's physiologic adaptive capacity. To diagnose optimal craniomandibular alignment, PNMD is guided by real-time objective physiologic data such as electromyography (EMG).","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174214","annotations":[{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.797654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.761981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.643012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.23322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.201725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0416512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint disorder","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder"},{"name":"Pope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Adaptive capacity","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_capacity"}]}
