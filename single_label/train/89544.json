{"id":89544,"title":"[Proximal femoral intramedullary nail versus DHS plate for the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures. A prospective analysis].","abstract":"To show that patients with intertrochanteric fractures treated with a proximal femoral nail have a better postoperative course than those treated with a DHS plate (dynamic hip screw).Patients with a Boyd & Griffin type II intertrochanteric fracture were randomly divided into two groups: a group of patients treated with a PFN and another one treated with a DHS plate. All patients were assessed at 2, 4, 8 and 16 weeks using the Harris scale and the visual analog scale pre- and postoperatively, as well as the operative time, incision size, intraoperative bleeding, onset of partial and/or total weight bearing, healing time, time to attain prior physical activity level, and radiographic result.32 patients met our criteria. The variables that had a significant reduction were: incision, operative time, postoperative pain according to the visual analog scale, onset of mobility, partial weight bearing and pain at 2 weeks.The proximal femoral nail has better short-term outcomes than the DHS plate; however, in the medium term both implants have the same outcomes.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707612","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.752698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.67713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.620168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.424505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Intramedullary rod","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramedullary_rod"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.33764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dynamic hip screw","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_hip_screw"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"United States Department of Health and Human Services","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Physical activity level","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_activity_level"},{"name":"Party of New Forces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_New_Forces"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
