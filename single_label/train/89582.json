{"id":89582,"title":"Extensor-mechanism-reconstruction of the knee joint after traumatic loss of the entire extensor apparatus.","abstract":"Injuries to the extensor apparatus of the knee joint have an incidence of 0.5% to 6%. Although previous studies have described the advantages and disadvantages of operative treatment in cases of patellar tendon rupture, patella fracture or quadriceps tendon lesions, a report on the reconstruction of the extensor apparatus after traumatic loss of the patella, the patellar tendon, the tibial tuberosity and parts of the lateral quadriceps muscle is absent from the literature. We present the case of a young motorcyclist who underwent a reconstruction of the extensor apparatus using autologous tendon grafts. At a 24-month follow-up, the patient has a nearly physiological range of motion of the knee joint and is able to cope well with everyday life.
