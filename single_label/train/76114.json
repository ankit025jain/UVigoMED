{"id":76114,"title":"[Relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and bone mineral density in children under 7 years old].","abstract":"To evaluate the endogenous vitamin D level and its correlation with bone mineral density (BMD) in children under 7 years old.Totally 6?838 children who visited the Growth and Development Clinic due to \"growth retardation, night terrors, hyperhidrosis, and dysphoria\" were enrolled in the study. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level was measured by chemiluminescence, whereas individual BMD was measured by quantitative ultrasound.Among all subjects, serum 25(OH)D level was 34 ± 14 ng/mL, and the Z value of BMD was -0.49 ± 0.54. With increasing age, serum 25(OH)D level and BMD decreased gradually (P<0.01), and the detection rates for vitamin D deficiency and low BMD increased gradually (P<0.01). Compared with those with sufficient vitamin D, children with vitamin D deficiency had a significantly lower BMD (P<0.01) and a significantly higher detection rate for low BMD (P<0.01). 25-(OH)D level showed a positive linear correlation with BMD in children with vitamin D deficiency (P<0.01).Preschool and school-age children have severer vitamin D deficiency than infants. Vitamin D level may be correlated with BMD within a certain range.","date":"2014-09-18","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229952","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.632587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.531578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.167108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.133777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.110315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Chemiluminescence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemiluminescence"},{"name":"Night terror","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_terror"},{"name":"Hyperhidrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhidrosis"},{"name":"Dysphoria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphoria"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.0178734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Atomic number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"}]}
