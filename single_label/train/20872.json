{"id":20872,"title":"Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibit variability in capsular polysaccharide and capsule associated virulence traits.","abstract":"Novel therapies are urgently needed to treat carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp)-mediated infection, which constitute a major health threat in the United States. In order to assess if it is feasible to develop anticapsular antibodies as a potential novel therapy, it is crucial to first systematically characterize capsular polysaccharide (CPS) and virulence traits in these strains.Forty CR-Kp were genotyped by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and molecular capsule typing (C-patterns and wzi sequencing). Their biofilm formation, serum resistance, macrophage-mediated killing, and virulence in Galleria mellonella were compared. MAb (1C9) was generated by co-immunization with 2 CPSs, and cross-reactivity was investigated.MLST assigned 80% of CR-Kp isolates to the ST258-clone. Molecular capsule typing identified new C-patterns, including C200/wzi-154, which was widely represented and associated with blaKPC-3-bearing strains. Heterogeneity was detected in biofilm formation and macrophage-mediated killing. Differences in serum resistance correlated with virulence in G. mellonella. ST258 strains carrying blaKPC-3 were less virulent than those with blaKPC-2. MAb 1C9 cross-reacted with 58% of CR-Kp CPSs.CR-Kp ST258 strains exhibit variability of virulence-associated traits. Differences were associated with the type of KPC gene and CPS. Identification of cross-reacting anti-CPS mAbs encourages their development as adjunctive therapy.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634498","annotations":[{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.790876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.746487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.740286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.692027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.654549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.647429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.632463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.529832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.445723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Pulsed field gel electrophoresis","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_field_gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.333385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0970692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0782123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Multilocus sequence typing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilocus_sequence_typing"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Bacterial capsule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"},{"name":"Polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide_encapsulated_bacteria"}]}
