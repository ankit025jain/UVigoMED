{"id":62188,"title":"Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma with unusual eschar-like crusting.","abstract":"Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the skin. Clinically, SPTCL presents as subcutaneous tumors located on the extremities or trunk, often associated with systemic symptoms like fever or fatigue. The therapeutic regimen for SPTCL is at present not standardized. We describe herein a case of a young woman who presented with intermittent fever and skin rash and was diagnosed later with SPTCL. The case is reported here for its rarity and rapidly changing unusual clinical manifestations. This case also highlights that monotherapy with systemic steroid can be a valuable treatment option for the management of SPTCL, especially in those without hemophagocytic syndrome.
