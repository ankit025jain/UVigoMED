{"id":56368,"title":"Congenital uveal malignant melanoma.","abstract":"We report the clinical and pathological findings of a rare case of congenital uveal melanoma. A 7-week-old girl presented with history of a black area at the inner corner of her left eye since birth. Examination revealed an enlarged globe with an area of visible uveal pigment nasal to the cornea, an iris mass, and shallow anterior chamber in the left eye. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intraocular mass. Enucleation was performed when the girl was 2 months of age. Pathologic examination confirmed a malignant melanoma epithelioid cell type with extraocular extension. She was treated with chemotherapy and subtotal exenteration.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698625","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.815354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Uveal melanoma","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveal_melanoma"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.787633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.710712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.613936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.406432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.319691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.28053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.165536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Uvea","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvea"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Earth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.0136408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"}]}
