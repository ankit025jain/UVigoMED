{"id":86665,"title":"Newly synthesized anticancer drug HUHS1015 is effective on malignant pleural mesothelioma.","abstract":"The newly synthesized naftopidil analogue HUHS1015 reduced cell viability in malignant pleural mesothelioma cell lines MSTO-211H, NCI-H28, NCI-H2052, and NCI-H2452, with the potential greater than that for the anticancer drugs paclitaxel or cisplatin at concentrations higher than 30Â ?M. HUHS1015 induced both necrosis and apoptosis of MSTO-211H and NCI-H2052 cells. HUHS1015 upregulated expression of mRNAs for Puma, Hrk, and Noxa in MSTO-211H and NCI-H2052 cells, suggesting HUHS1015-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. HUHS1015 clearly suppressed tumor growth in mice inoculated with NCI-H2052 cells. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that HUHS1015 could be developed as an effective anticancer drug for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma.
