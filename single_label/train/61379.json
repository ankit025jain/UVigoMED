{"id":61379,"title":"[Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma].","abstract":"Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a subtype of nodal peripheral T-cell lymphoma associated with aggressive clinical course that affects mostly the elderly. Clinical features at diagnosis are characterized by polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, B-symptoms, and advanced stage. It usually responds to anthracycline-based chemotherapy but eventually relapses with a median progression free survival of less than 2 years. High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is an option for improving prognosis both in first-line and in relapsed or refractory settings. Several prospective clinical trials are evaluating the role of high dose chemotherapy as a consolidation in first-line treatment for T-cell lymphoma including AITL.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724413","annotations":[{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Autologous stem cell transplantation","weight":0.709789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autologous_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.567055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.526731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Hypergammaglobulinemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergammaglobulinemia"},{"name":"Polyclonal antibodies","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
