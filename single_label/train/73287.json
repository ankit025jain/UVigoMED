{"id":73287,"title":"Heterogeneity of epidemiological factors by breast tumor subtypes in Korean women: a case-case study.","abstract":"Breast cancer is heterogeneous in clinical behavior by subtypes; however, it is unclear how this heterogeneity is related to epidemiological factors. To evaluate the differences in epidemiological factors by breast tumor subtypes, we investigated the associations of epidemiological factors between tumor subtypes in Korean women. From the Seoul Breast Cancer Study, a total of 3,058 patients with breast cancer were included in the analyses. Tumor subtypes were classified based on hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses. The epidemiological factors of each subtype were compared through case-case analyses using multivariate a polytomous logistic regression model adjusted for age and recruiting centers. The distribution of the subtypes was as follows: 1,714 HR+ HER2- (56.0%), 414 HR+ HER2+ (13.5%), 423 HR- HER2+ (13.9%) and 507 HR- HER2- (16.6%) patients with breast cancer. There were significant differences in age, menopausal status, age at menarche, number of children, age at first full-term pregnancy (FFTP), duration of breastfeeding and duration of endogenous estrogen exposure between tumor subtypes (p?<?0.05). Compared to HR+ HER2- patients, the other subtype patients showed more frequency in having more numbers of children and less frequency in having earlier menarche, later FFTP and longer endogenous estrogen exposure. Although HR- HER2+ patients were less obese, HR- HER2- patients were younger and more obese. In conclusion, age, body mass index and reproductive factors were differentially associated with breast tumor subtypes suggesting a possible distinct etiology for tumor progression.
