{"id":64645,"title":"Allergic reactions to Anisakis found in fish.","abstract":"The food-borne parasite Anisakis is an important hidden food allergen. Anisakis is a parasitic nematode which has a third-stage larval form that infects mainly fish, and ingestion of contaminated seafood can result in severe allergic reactions. Symptoms experienced due to exposure to this parasite include gastrointestinal disorders, urticaria, dermatitis, asthma and even anaphylaxis. Accurate prevalence data of allergic sensitisation to Anisakis are difficult to estimate due to the lack of well-designed population-based studies. Current diagnostic approaches rely on the detection of serum IgE antibodies to allergenic proteins, which however demonstrate considerable immunological cross-reactivity to other invertebrate allergens. While exposure to this parasite seems to increase due to the increasing consumption of seafood worldwide, the immunology of infection and allergic sensitization is not fully understood.
