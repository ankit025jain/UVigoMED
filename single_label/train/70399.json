{"id":70399,"title":"Giant ethmoid osteoma originated from the lamina papyracea.","abstract":"Osteomas are slow- growing, benign tumors. They are the most common neoplasms of the paranasal sinuses. They are usually originates from the frontal and ethmoid sinus and much less frequently seen in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. Although the lamina papyracea is a part of ethmoid bone, a giant osteoma originated from the lamina papyracea is very uncommon. An osteoma of the paranasal sinus is usually asymptomatic. Headache, proptosis, epiphora, diplopia, dizziness, facial deformity, face pain and cerebral complications are possible symptoms. The treatment of the paranasal osteomas are controversial.A 65 year old patient that applied with stuffiness and headache to our clinic. She has had a smooth mass in the right nasal cavity. Paranasal sinus tomography showed an osseous lesion, the size of 4 x 3 cm, arising from the right lamina papyracea. The mass excised endoscopically and reported as osteoma histopathologically. There was no complication. After 9 months, there was no recurrence.Giant osteomas of paranasal sinuses, especially originated from the lamina papyracea are rare. They can be treated successfully by endoscopic approaches without any recurrence and complication despite its size.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195355","annotations":[{"name":"Ethmoid sinus","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethmoid_sinus"},{"name":"Diplopia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Sphenoidal sinus","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoidal_sinus"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Nasal cavity","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.704066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Sphenoid bone","weight":0.666265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.634709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Exophthalmos","weight":0.634441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophthalmos"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ethmoid bone","weight":0.550875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethmoid_bone"},{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.521095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.383757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Osteoma","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.160334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Orbital lamina of ethmoid bone","weight":0.0485372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_lamina_of_ethmoid_bone"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.0468441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Nasal bone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bone"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Sinus (anatomy)","weight":0.0136408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"}]}
