{"id":77457,"title":"Major health problems of expressway workers in Thailand: an 8-year cohort study.","abstract":"Workers in the transportation sector may be expose to environmental hazards resulting in adverse health outcomes. The present study aimed to assess environmental-hazard-related morbidity among transportation workers over an eight-year periodData were extracted from the registry database of a cohort of workers in the Expressway Authority of Thailand between 2004 and 2011. Annual trends and changes in health status were described. Factors associated with major health problems were also evaluatedThe cohort consisted of 2,000 to 2,700 workers. The trend of abnormal lung function, abnormal hearing, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and asthma significantly increased over the period. Very few workers had high serum lead levels.The present study revealed several major occupation-related health problems among transportation workers. In addition to an annual health assessment, other control measures should be instituted to protect workers from occupation-related exposures.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24765905","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.695711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.669436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.561689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.532872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.501912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.497669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Lead poisoning","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning"},{"name":"Hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.295618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.142562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"List of environmental health hazards","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_environmental_health_hazards"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Health assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_assessment"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Gulf War syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War_syndrome"},{"name":"Controlled-access highway","weight":0.0137002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway"}]}
