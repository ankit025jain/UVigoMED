{"id":79017,"title":"Identification of both MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G and bi-allelic GJB2 mutations in probands with non-syndromic hearing loss.","abstract":"Mutations in GJB2 and MT-RNR1 are common causes for non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL). In this study, we investigated the co-existence of both MT-RNR1 and bi-allelic GJB2 mutations in a large number of simplex and multiplex probands with NSHL.485 simplex and 134 multiplex probands with NSHL were recruited for mutation screening of GJB2 and MT-RNR1 by bidirectional sequencing. Clinical features of probands with both MT-RNR1 and bi-allelic GJB2 mutations were further analyzed in comparison with extended family members.MT-RNR1m.1555A>G and bi-allelic GJB2 mutations were both detected in one (0.21%) simplex probands and two (1.49%) multiplex probands. Variable hearing phenotypes were found in a pair of siblings with both MT-RNR1 and bi-allelic GJB2 mutations.MT-RNR1 and bi-allelic GJB2 mutations may co-exist not only in multiplex probands but also in simplex probands. The variable hearing phenotypes in closely-related family members may reflect the co-existence of different molecular causes and prompt extended genetic tests.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507663","annotations":[{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Proband","weight":0.274836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proband"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Nonsyndromic deafness","weight":0.194585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsyndromic_deafness"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.176462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.0945851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0375437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"GJB2","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GJB2"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Multiplexing","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing"},{"name":"1555","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1555"},{"name":"Simplex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex"},{"name":"Aktiengesellschaft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiengesellschaft"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-existence_of_genetically_modified_and_conventional_crops_and_derived_food_and_feed"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Extended family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_family"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"}]}
