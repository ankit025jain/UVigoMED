{"id":42962,"title":"[Surgical treatment of patients with severe fecal incontinence].","abstract":"The objective of the study is improvement of clinical and functional results of surgical treatment of patients with severe fecal incontinence. 79 patients with complete fecal incontinence were included in the study. The technique of surgical intervention was choosed in depending on the localization of structural and functional disorders of the rectum closing apparatus. Complex treatment in pre-operative and post-operative periods was directed on the improvement of functional results. Long-term results (6-24 months) were traced in 63 patients after surgical treatment and complex post-operative rehabilitation. Good and satisfactory results were identified in 57 (90.5%) patients, unsatisfactory results - in 6 (9.5%) patients. Choice of surgical technique in depending on the localization of structural and functional disorders of the rectum closing apparatus and combination of surgical correction with complex functional rehabilitation allow to increase treatment efficiency. Also it improves closing function in the most patients.
