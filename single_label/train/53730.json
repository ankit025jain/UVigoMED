{"id":53730,"title":"[Case of giant cell anaplastic ductal carcinoma of the pancreas].","abstract":"A 56-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with fever and systemic malaise. Abdominal computed tomography revealed an enhanced tumor of the pancreatic head, measuring 9cm in maximal diameter and containing a low-density area. Subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. Hemorrhage and necrosis were evident within the tumor, and osteoclastic polynuclear giant cells were also identified. A diagnosis of giant cell anaplastic ductal carcinoma of the pancreas was made. The patient has been free from recurrence for 6 months since surgery.
