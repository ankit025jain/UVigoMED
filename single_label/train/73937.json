{"id":73937,"title":"Combination of 2-methoxy-3-phenylsulfonylaminobenzamide and 2-aminobenzothiazole to discover novel anticancer agents.","abstract":"The fragment of 2-substituted-3-sulfonylaminobenzamide has been proposed to replace the fragment of 2-substituted-3-sulfonylaminopyridine in PI3K and mTOR dual inhibitors to design novel anticancer agents based on bioisostere. The combination of the fragment of 2-substituted-3-sulfonylaminobenzamide with the fragment of 2-aminobenzothiazole or 2-aminothiazolo[5,4-b]pyridine, or 2-amino[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine produced the novel structures of anticancer agents. As a result, nineteen target compounds were synthesized and characterized. Their antiproliferative activities in vitro were evaluated via MTT assay against four human cancer cell lines including HCT-116, A549, MCF-7 and U-87 MG. The SAR of target compounds was preliminarily discussed. Compound 1g with potent antiproliferative activity was examined for its effect on the AKT and p-AKT(473). The anticancer effect of 1g was evaluated in established nude mice HCT-116 xenograft model. The results suggested that compound 1g can block PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and significantly inhibit tumor growth. These findings strongly support our assumption that the fragment of benzamide can replace the pyridine ring in some PI3K and mTOR dual inhibitor to design novel anticancer agents.
