{"id":26709,"title":"Training surgeons in minimally invasive mitral valve repair: a single institution experience.","abstract":"We aimed to study the results of minimally invasive mitral valve repair performed by 5 young surgeons who were trained in mitral valve repair directly through a minimally invasive approach, and a senior surgeon who introduced the technique at our institution and was responsible for the training program.This was a retrospective, observational cohort study of prospectively collected data from 595 consecutive patients who underwent minimally invasive mitral repair performed by 5 trainees (n = 240, 40.3%) and by our lead consultant (n = 355, 59.7%) between 2007 and 2013. Treatment selection bias was controlled by constructing a propensity score from core patient characteristics and it was included along with the comparison variable in the multivariable analyses of outcome.Patients operated on by trainees were more likely to be female (p = 0.04), older (p = 0.001), and with history of atrial fibrillation (p = 0.001). Trainees required a significant longer cardiopulmonary bypass (137 ± 56 vs 123 ± 52 minutes; p = 0.003) and aortic clamp time (97 ± 41 vs 83 ± 40 minutes; p = 0.001). I-hospital mortalities were 1.3% in the trainees group and 0.8% in the senior surgeon group (p = 0.6). The incidence of stroke (1.7% vs 2.5%; p = 0.5), conversion to sternotomy (2.6% vs 3.5%; p = 0.5), and conversion to mitral valve replacement (12.5% vs 10.9%; p = 0.6) were similar between groups. No differences were found regarding other complications. Five-year survival (88.9% vs 89.5%; p = 0.4) and freedom from reoperation (94.5% vs 95.1; p = 0.6) were similar between groups.Minimally invasive mitral valve repair is a safe and reproducible surgical technique that can be taught successfully to cardiac trainees.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087930","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Atrial fibrillation","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.74506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Selection bias","weight":0.710405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.648787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.406998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.275382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Mitral valve repair","weight":0.133889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve_repair"},{"name":"Median sternotomy","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_sternotomy"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0396407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Mitral valve replacement","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve_replacement"},{"name":"Valve replacement","weight":0.0210801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_replacement"},{"name":"Fibrillation","weight":0.0193016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrillation"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Clamp (tool)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamp_(tool)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Heart valve repair","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve_repair"}]}
