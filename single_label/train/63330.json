{"id":63330,"title":"[Rapidly progressive AL amyloidosis in a patient with relapsed multiple myeloma after achieving a complete response to tandem autologous PBSCT].","abstract":"A 56-year-old male presented with pathological rib fracture and lumbago in 2006. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma (IgG-lambda type, D&S stage IIIA, ISS 2). He was treated with VAD therapy and tandem auto-PBSCT, and achieved CR in 2007. He was followed without chemotherapy, but relapsed in 2009. He received lenalidomide plus dexamethasone and bortezomib plus dexamethasone and achieved PR which was sustained for 25 months. In 2012, he developed edema of the lower legs and pleural effusion, and was diagnosed as having nephrotic syndrome and heart failure due to AL amyloidosis. He died of renal failure and heart failure 3 months after this diagnosis. Autopsy findings showed amyloid deposition in many organs including the heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, and intestines. Development of rapidly progressive AL amyloidosis is a rare complication of relapse after the achievement of CR, but careful monitoring is needed in patients with multiple myeloma.
