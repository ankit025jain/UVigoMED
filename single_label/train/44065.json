{"id":44065,"title":"MicroRNA-31 expression in relation to BRAF mutation, CpG island methylation and colorectal continuum in serrated lesions.","abstract":"The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is a distinct form of epigenomic instability. Many CIMP-high colorectal cancers (CRCs) with BRAF mutation are considered to arise from serrated pathway. We recently reported that microRNA-31 (miR-31) is associated with BRAF mutation in colorectal tumors. Emerging new approaches have revealed gradual changes in BRAF mutation and CIMP-high throughout the colorectum in CRCs. Here, we attempted to identify a possible association between miR-31 and epigenetic features in serrated pathway, and hypothesized that miR-31 supports the \"colorectal continuum\" concept. We evaluated miR-31 expression, BRAF mutation and epigenetic features including CIMP status in 381 serrated lesions and 222 non-serrated adenomas and examined associations between them and tumor location (rectum; sigmoid, descending, transverse and ascending colon and cecum). A significant association was observed between high miR-31 expression and CIMP-high status in serrated lesions with BRAF mutation (p?=?0.0001). In contrast, miR-31 was slightly but insignificantly associated with CIMP status in the cases with wild-type BRAF. miR-31 expression in sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs) with cytological dysplasia was higher than that in SSAs, whereas, no significant difference was observed between traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs) and TSAs with high-grade dysplasia. The frequency of miR-31, BRAF mutation CIMP-high and MLH1 methylation increased gradually from the rectum to cecum in serrated lesions. In conclusion, miR-31 expression was associated with CIMP-high status in serrated lesions with BRAF mutation. Our data also suggested that miR-31 plays an important role in SSA evolution and may be a molecule supporting the colorectal continuum.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752710","annotations":[{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.862549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cecum","weight":0.790507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecum"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.767944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.76687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.75335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.716491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.706266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.705394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.683772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.658496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"CpG island","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_island"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Ascending colon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_colon"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Sessility (zoology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sessility_(zoology)"},{"name":"MLH1","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLH1"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
