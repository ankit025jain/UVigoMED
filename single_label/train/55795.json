{"id":55795,"title":"Serous retinal detachment accompanied by MEWDS in a myopic patient with dome-shaped macula.","abstract":"Macular serous retinal detachment (MSRD) is a rare complication in highly myopic patients with an inferior staphyloma, tilted disc, or dome-shaped macula. Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS) presents with sudden visual loss and multiple yellowish dots that resolve spontaneously within several weeks. The authors report the development and spontaneous resolution of subretinal fluid accompanied by MEWDS in a myopic patient with a dome-shaped macula. Dysfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium due to MEWDS likely induced temporary MSRD in this patient.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24806701","annotations":[{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.838542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Macula of retina","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula_of_retina"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.608697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.559653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.499584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.282675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Vision loss","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pixel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Optical resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_resolution"},{"name":"Chiral resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiral_resolution"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Dysfunction (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunction_(album)"},{"name":"Evanescent wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanescent_wave"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.0111494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"}]}
