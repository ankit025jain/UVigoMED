{"id":89788,"title":"Safety and efficacy of edoxaban in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.","abstract":"Edoxaban is an oral, direct, once-daily factor Xa inhibitor. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of edoxaban compared to subcutaneous enoxaparin in Japanese patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-comparator, phase 3 trial, 92 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive edoxaban 30mg once daily (n=62) or enoxaparin sodium (enoxaparin) 2000IU (equivalent to 20mg) twice daily (n=30) for 11 to 14days. The primary endpoints were the incidence of major or clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding and incidence of any bleeding events (major, CRNM, or minor bleeding). Secondary efficacy endpoints included the incidence of thromboembolic events, venous thromboembolism-related deaths, and all-cause deaths. Additional adverse events were recorded throughout the study.In the edoxaban and enoxaparin treatment groups, the incidence of major or CRNM bleeding was 3.4% and 6.9%, respectively, while any bleeding event occurred in 25.4% and 17.2% of patients, respectively. The incidence of thromboembolic events was 6.5% in the edoxaban group and 3.7% in the enoxaparin group. All events were asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis. The incidence of adverse events was 72.9% and 82.8% in the edoxaban and enoxaparin groups, respectively.Compared to subcutaneous enoxaparin 2000IU twice daily, oral edoxaban 30mg once daily demonstrated similar safety and efficacy in the prevention of thromboembolic events in Japanese patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680549","annotations":[{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.74448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.711244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.697668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.678432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.646739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Enoxaparin sodium","weight":0.481163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoxaparin_sodium"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.229042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Factor X","weight":0.0972222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_X"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.0169501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Deep vein","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein"},{"name":"Phase III trial","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_III_trial"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"}]}
