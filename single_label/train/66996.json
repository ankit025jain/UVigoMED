{"id":66996,"title":"[Cytogenetics profiles of renal carcinoma].","abstract":"Renal carcinomas are histologically and prognostically heterogeneous. Genomic as well as chromosomal studies of these tumors have permitted a better comprehension of molecular mechanisms implicated in their development and progression. The most frequent histological subtypes are characterized by recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities, such as the loss of the chromosome 3 short arm involving a VHL gene copy in clear cell renal carcinomas, or trisomies 7 and 17 in papillary renal cell carcinomas. New histological subtypes like renal carcinomas associated with Xp11.2 translocations have also been individualized. Besides diagnosis, some chromosomal aberrations like the loss of a short arm of chromosome 9 in different renal carcinoma histological subtypes have a worse prognostic impact. The identification of chromosomal shuffles contributes in backing histological diagnosis and in precising the individual prognosis of patients. This review describes chromosomal abnormalities associated to renal carcinomas and their impact for an accurate classification of these tumors and the evaluation of their prognosis.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656859","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chromosome 9 (human)","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_9_(human)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.658103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.368227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Chromosome 3 (human)","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_3_(human)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.241683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Gene dosage","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_dosage"},{"name":"VHL","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHL"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"}]}
