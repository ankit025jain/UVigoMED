{"id":73506,"title":"Nuclear CSPP1 expression defined subtypes of basal-like breast cancer.","abstract":"The multi-exon CSPP1 gene, encoding for centrosome and microtubule-associated proteins involved in ciliogenesis and cell division, is a candidate oncogene in luminal breast cancer but expression of CSPP1 proteins remained unexplored.CSPP1 gene and protein expression was examined in normal mammary tissue, human breast cancer cell lines, and primary breast cancer biopsies from two patient cohorts. Cell type and epitope-dependent subcellular-specific CSPP1 staining pattern in normal mammary gland epithelium and cancer biopsies were correlated to molecular and clinical parameters.A novel, nuclear localised CSPP1 isoform was exclusively detected in luminal epithelial cells, whereas cytoplasmic CSPP-L was generally expressed in normal mammary epithelium. Luminal cell-related nuclear CSPP1 expression was preserved in type-matched cell lines and carcinomas, and correlated to gene copy number and mRNA expression. In contrast, basal-like carcinomas displayed generally lower CSPP1 mRNA expression. Yet, a subgroup of basal-like breast carcinomas depicted nuclear CSPP1 expression, displayed luminal traits, and differed from nuclear CSPP1 devoid counterparts in expression of eight genes. Eight-gene signature defined groups of basal-like tumours from an independent cohort showed significant differences in survival.Differential expression of a nuclear CSPP1 isoform identified biologically and clinically distinct subgroups of basal-like breast carcinoma.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901235","annotations":[{"name":"Centrosome","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrosome"},{"name":"Centriole","weight":0.846361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centriole"},{"name":"Mammary
