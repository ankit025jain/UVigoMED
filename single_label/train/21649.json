{"id":21649,"title":"Response to antiretroviral therapy (ART): comparing women with previous use of zidovudine monotherapy (ZDVm) in pregnancy with ART naïve women.","abstract":"Short-term zidovudine monotherapy (ZDVm) remains an option for some pregnant HIV-positive women not requiring treatment for their own health but may affect treatment responses once antiretroviral therapy (ART) is subsequently started.Data were obtained by linking two UK studies: the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (UK CHIC) study and the National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood (NSHPC). Treatment responses were assessed for 2028 women initiating ART at least one year after HIV-diagnosis. Outcomes were compared using logistic regression, proportional hazards regression or linear regression.In adjusted analyses, ART-naïve (n?=?1937) and ZDVm-experienced (n?=?91) women had similar increases in CD4 count and a similar proportion achieving virological suppression; both groups had a low risk of AIDS.In this setting, antenatal ZDVm exposure did not adversely impact on outcomes once ART was initiated for the woman's health.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24593018","annotations":[{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.809788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.745886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.354069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.313775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Zidovudine","weight":0.140579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zidovudine"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.113499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Nave","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"2028","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2028"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Self care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_care"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Re Saul D Harrison & Sons plc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re_Saul_D_Harrison_&_Sons_plc"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Cohort (military unit)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
