{"id":65443,"title":"Computer-assisted three-dimensional analysis of multifocal/multicentric prostate cancer.","abstract":"In order to study multiple contiguous prostate cancer lesions, we constructed computer-assisted, three-dimensional models of multifocal prostate cancer specimens obtained by radical prostatectomy. We then examined the genetic heterogeneity among the specimens by DNA microarray analysis. Cancer foci with high Gleason patterns were found to occur de novo, whereas those with low Gleason patterns occurred contiguously with cancers of low Gleason patterns. Three-dimensional analysis showed that distinct, noncontiguous cancerous foci were genetically independent and multicentric. In contrast some contiguous multifocal lesions had the same genetic origin.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827595","annotations":[{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.724617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.525106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.402995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.357486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.351053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.337859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Focus (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry)"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"De novo","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"},{"name":"Contiguity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguity"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
