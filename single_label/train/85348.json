{"id":85348,"title":"[Exploration and research of community management model for asthmatic children].","abstract":"To study the efficacy of community management model of bronchial asthma in children.Through community outreach and clinic, 120 cases of children with asthma were enrolled from the 11 000 children aged 0 to 14 in Zhanlanlu area, and a community management model of asthma was established according to the Global Initiative for Asthma requirements combined with the actual situation of the community, both physicians and patients participated in case identification, file creation, and long-term standardized management. Through repeated medical education, the telephone hotline and interactive network of asthma among physicians, children and parents, a physician-patient relationship was established. The data of standardized medication, scheduled re-visit to the hospital, frequency of asthma attacks, antibiotic use, medical expenses, the loss of parents work hours etc. before and after the implementation of community management model were analyzed and compared.After implementation of community management model, the use of systemic corticosteroids (19.4%), oral medication (31.6%) was significantly lower than those before implementation (68.3% and 90.0%) (?(2) = 51.9, 41.1, P < 0.01), use of inhaled corticosteroids (76.5%) and oral leukotriene receptor antagonist (79.6%) was significantly higher compared with control and before management level (10.0%), ?(2) = 106.0, P < 0.01. The days of attacks of asthma (4.6 ± 2.3), the use of antibiotics (16.2 ± 6.1), (5.7 ± 2.9) and the cost of treatment significantly decreased. In 16 cases (13.3%) two-way referral was applied. In this study, the dropout rate was 18.3%, by telephone and network supervision of lost cases, re-education, made some children return to management, eventually the dropout rate was 9.2%.Enrollment of children with bronchial asthma into community management model made the children adhere to the management regularly and a standardized management was achieved.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Respiratory Tract
