{"id":8234,"title":"Expression differences of miRNAs and genes on NF-?B pathway between the healthy and the mastitis Chinese Holstein cows.","abstract":"In order to discover the variation of microRNAs and genes associated with NF-?B signaling pathway between the healthy and the mastitis Chinese Holstein cows, Illumina Deep Sequencing and qRT-PCR are applied to detect 25 kinds of miRNAs (miR-16, miR-125b, miR-15, miR-29a, miR-23b, miR-146, miR-301a, miR-181b, let-7, miR-30b, miR-21, miR-223, miR-27b, miR-10a, miR-143, etc.) expression levels in blood samples and 14 genes (RelA, RelB, Rel, p105, p100, I?B?, I?B?, I?B?, I?B?, I?B?, Bcl-3, IKK?, IKK?, IKK?/NEMO) relative expression levels in nine tissues. The total number of miRNAs is declining, and RelA, Rel, p105, p100, I?B?, I?B?, I?B?, I?B?, Bcl-3, and IKK? expressions are rising in mastitis individuals. So, we suppose that NF-?B pathway is active in mastitis individuals as a result of the decrease inhibition of miRNAs. While in healthy ones, the NF-?B pathway is inactive, because of the miRNAs enhanced inhibition action. However, the specific regulatory mechanism of miRNAs on NF-?B pathway in mastitis Holstein cows needs further investigation. Moreover, due to obvious expression differences, some miRNAs, especially miR-16 and miR-223, may be used as new markers for the dairy mastitis prognosing.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793582","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.646552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mastitis","weight":0.638159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastitis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.617984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.549947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.359972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Illumina (company)","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina_(company)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.205101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.190833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Dairy","weight":0.0375893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"223","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/223"},{"name":"Holstein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holstein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Facial expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_expression"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Rel (DBMS)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rel_(DBMS)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"National Film Board of Canada","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Board_of_Canada"},{"name":"RELA","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELA"},{"name":"Holstein cattle","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holstein_cattle"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"International Baccalaureate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Baccalaureate"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"}]}
