{"id":12779,"title":"Rutin improves functional outcome via reducing the elevated matrix metalloproteinase-9 level in a photothrombotic focal ischemic model of rats.","abstract":"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption mediated by proteases plays a pivotal role in neural tissue damage after acute ischemic stroke. In an animal stroke model, the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-9, was significantly increased and it showed potential association with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and cerebral edema. Theoretically, it is expected that early blockade of expression and activation of MMP-9 after ischemic stroke provides neuroprotective effects from secondary neural tissue damage. This study was aimed to determine the ability of rutin to influence MMP-9 expression, activity and BBB disruption using a photothrombotic focal ischemic model in rats.Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing between 250 and 300 g (aged 8 weeks) received focal cerebral ischemia by photothrombosis using Rose Bengal (RB) and cold light. Injured animals were divided into two groups; one group received 50mg/kg of rutin intraperitoneally, starting 1h after injury and at 12h intervals for 3 days, while animals in the control group received weight-adjusted doses of saline vehicle over the same period. In each group, the expressions and activities of MMP-9 were assessed by Western blot and gelatin zymography at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after photothrombotic insult. The effects of rutin on BBB disruption and functional outcomes were also determined.Western blot and zymographic analysis showed up-regulated MMP-9 expression and activity in the ischemic cortex. The expression and activity of MMP-9 were significantly elevated at 6h after photothrombotic insult, which remained up-regulated for at least until 72 h after injury. In the rutin-treated group, MMP-9 expression and activity were significantly attenuated at 6, 24, and 48 h compared to the control group. Relative to the control group, BBB permeability was significantly reduced in the rutin-treated group. The results of the rotarod test revealed that rutin treatment significantly improved functional outcomes.Rutin treatment starting 1h after injury attenuated BBB disruption during photothrombotic focal ischemia, which was partly, at least, achieved through inhibitory effects on MMP-9 expression and activity. The results of this study suggest that rutin might be useful in clinical trials aimed to improve the outcome of patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Animal
