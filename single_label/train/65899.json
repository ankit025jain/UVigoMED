{"id":65899,"title":"Can electronic web-based technology improve quality of life data collection? Analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0828.","abstract":"Missing data are a significant problem in clinical trials, particularly for quality of life (QOL), which cannot be obtained retrospectively. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of an electronic web-based strategy for QOL data collection in a cooperative group radiation oncology trial setting.Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0828 was a prospective National Cancer Institute cooperative group companion study of RTOG-0415, a randomized study of conventional versus hypofractionated radiation. Forty-nine English-speaking patients with favorable risk prostate cancer who enrolled on RTOG-0415 consented to using web-based technology for completing QOL. In RTOG-0415, using paper forms, the 6-month QOL compliance rate was 52%. The purpose of RTOG-0828 was to test the feasibility of a web-based strategy with the goal of increasing the 6-month QOL completion rate by 25% (from 52% to 77%) for a relative improvement of ~50%. The web-based tool used in this study was VisionTree Optimal Care (VTOC; VisionTree Software, Inc, San Diego, CA), a Health-Insurance-Portability-Accountability-Act secure, online technology that allows real-time tracking and e-mail reminders. The primary endpoint was the 6-month compliance rate for the validated QOL instrument, Expanded Prostate Index Composite.The QOL completion rate at baseline was 98%. Compared with the prior 52% QOL completion rate at 6 months using paper forms, the QOL web-based completion rate at 6 months was 90% (2-sided P value < .001). At 12 months, the EPIC completion rate was 82% (compared with 36% using paper forms).This RTOG study suggests that a web-based strategy to collect QOL appears to be feasible in the cooperative group radiation oncology trial setting and is associated with an increase in the 6-month QOL compliance rate compared with the prior method of using paper forms. The RTOG plans to further test this strategy in a head-and-neck cancer trial across all participating RTOG sites.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766686","annotations":[{"name":"National Cancer Institute","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.717131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.596967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.531022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.486421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"San Diego","weight":0.468265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.175367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Email","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Missing data","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Cooperative","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Pet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Can (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)"},{"name":"Web application","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Electronic Privacy Information Center","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Privacy_Information_Center"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Volume table of contents","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_table_of_contents"}]}
