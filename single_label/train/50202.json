{"id":50202,"title":"Genetic polymorphisms of TCF7L2 lack influence on risk of the polycystic ovary syndrome - a systemic analysis.","abstract":"The results of previous researches that analyzed the association between genetic polymorphisms of transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2, rs7903146) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were conflicting. Current systematic analysis was conducted to re-explore this association using updated materials.The PubMed database was used for data collection and the final search was conducted on January 3, 2014. For TCF7L2 rs7903146, a non-significant slight increase in risk of PCOS development was observed under three genetic models (dominant model: OR=1.06, 95%CI: 0.93-1.21, p>0.05; recessive model: OR=1.12, 95%CI: 0.87-1.43, p> 0.05; homozygous model: OR=1.14, 95%CI: 0.87-1.47, p>0.05). In the subgroup analyses in Asian group, allele susceptibility of PCOS was calculated (allele model: OR=1.00, 95%CI: 0.74-1.35, p>0.05; dominant model: OR=0.98, 95%CI: 0.71-1.35, p>0.05; recessive model: OR=1.79, 95%CI: 0.33-9.84, p>0.05; homozygous model: OR=1.78, 95%CI: 0.32-9.80, p>0.05), the differences were again not statistically significant.The findings of this systemic analysis suggest that the polymorphism of TCF7L2 rs7903146 may not be associated with the susceptibility to PCOS.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815492","annotations":[{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.864258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.783382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.755154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.623636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.562133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.455534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.292156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Linguistics","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"TCF7L2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCF7L2"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"January 3","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_3"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"741","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/741"},{"name":"711","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/711"},{"name":"871","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/871"},{"name":"931","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/931"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Asian (cat)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_(cat)"},{"name":"Return to Sender (Dexter)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Sender_(Dexter)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
