{"id":66160,"title":"Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis in a child with nephrotic syndrome.","abstract":"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) as a complication in children with nephrotic syndrome is rarely reported. Although clinical characteristics are increasingly recognized, therapeutic management and clinical outcomes are not well documented. This case report presents a 10-year-old female who presented with dehydration associated with headache and decreased level of consciousness, which required intubation. Brain imaging revealed CVT. Thrombolytic therapy was started, and she showed a good clinical, as well as radiological recovery. The literature was reviewed to highlight the benefit of such therapy in cases with life threatening complications.
