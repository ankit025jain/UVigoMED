{"id":73358,"title":"Cancer patients acceptance, understanding, and willingness-to-pay for pharmacogenomic testing.","abstract":"Pharmacogenomics is gaining increasing importance in the therapeutics of cancer; yet, there is little knowledge of cancer patients' attitudes toward the use of pharmacogenomic testing in clinical practice. We carried out this study to explore cancer patients' acceptance, understanding, and willingness-to-pay for pharmacogenomic testing.A broad cross-section of gastrointestinal, lung, breast, and other cancer patients were interviewed in terms of their acceptance of pharmacogenomic testing using hypothetical time, efficacy, and toxicity trade-off and willingness-to-pay scenarios.Among the 96% of 123 adjuvant patients accepting chemotherapy under optimal conditions, 99% wanted pharmacogenomic testing that could identify a subset of patients benefiting from chemotherapy, accepting median incurred costs of $2000 (range $0-25,000) and turnaround time for test results of 16 days (range 0-90 days). Among the 97% of 121 metastatic patients accepting chemotherapy, 97.4% wanted pharmacogenomic testing that could detect the risk of severe toxicity, accepting median incurred costs of $1000 (range $0-10,000) and turnaround time for results of 14 days (range 1-90 days). The majority of patients wanted to be involved in decision-making on pharmacogenomic testing; however, one in five patients lacked a basic understanding of pharmacogenomic testing.Among cancer patients willing to undergo chemotherapy, almost all wanted pharmacogenomic testing and were willing-to-pay for it, waiting several weeks for results. Although patients had a strong desire to be involved in decision-making on pharmacogenomic testing, a considerable proportion lacked the necessary knowledge to make informed choices.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24911662","annotations":[{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.770182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.678124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.534913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Pharmacogenomics","weight":0.148912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacogenomics"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.056379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Turnaround (filmmaking)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnaround_(filmmaking)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Trade-off","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade-off"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
