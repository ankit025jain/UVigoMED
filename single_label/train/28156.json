{"id":28156,"title":"Potential of social media as a tool to combat foodborne illness.","abstract":"The use of social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, has been increasing substantially in recent years and has affected the way that people access information online. Social media rely on high levels of interaction and user-generated context shared through established and evolving social networks. Health information providers must know how to successfully participate through social media in order to meet the needs of these online audiences. This article reviews the current research on the use of social media for public health communication and suggests potential frameworks for developing social media strategies. The extension to food safety risk communication is explored, considering the potential of social media as a tool to combat foodborne illness.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24990140","annotations":[{"name":"Social network","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"},{"name":"Facebook","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Social media","weight":0.734693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.631704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.631202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Twitter","weight":0.594133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.563739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Risk management","weight":0.49647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management"},{"name":"Digital media","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.461225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Food safety","weight":0.362428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.210637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"},{"name":"Combat","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat"},{"name":"Foodborne illness","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness"},{"name":"Plug-in (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)"},{"name":"List of social networking websites","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites"},{"name":"Health communication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_communication"},{"name":"Potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential"},{"name":"Conceptual framework","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"}]}
