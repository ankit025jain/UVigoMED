{"id":60740,"title":"Reactive hemophagocytic syndrome in adults: a retrospective analysis of 162 patients.","abstract":"Current knowledge in reactive hemophagocytic syndrome mainly relies on single-center case series including a relatively small number of patients. We aimed to identify a multicenter large cohort of adult patients with reactive hemophagocytic syndrome and to describe relevant clinical and laboratory features, underlying conditions, and outcome.We conducted a multicenter study in 3 tertiary care centers in France over a 6-year period. The medical files of 312 patients with suspected hemophagocytic syndrome were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were classified with a positive, negative, or undetermined diagnosis of hemophagocytic syndrome by experts' consensus.Among the 312 patients fulfilling our inclusion criteria, 162 were classified with positive hemophagocytic syndrome (male, 67%; median age, 48 [35-62] years). Compared with patients without hemophagocytic syndrome, patients with hemophagocytic syndrome more frequently had an underlying immunodepression (45% vs 33%, P = .03) and exhibited higher temperature, ferritin, triglycerides, aspartate transaminase, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein, and lower hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, and sodium levels. Only 70% of them had hemophagocytosis features on bone marrow aspiration. Hematologic malignancies, especially non-Hodgkin lymphomas, were the main trigger of hemophagocytic syndrome, accounting for 56% of cases. The early mortality rate (ie, within 1 month after diagnosis) was 20%. Patients with hematologic malignancies-associated hemophagocytic syndrome had a poorer early outcome than those with underlying infection.In this large, multicenter study, hematologic malignancies are the main disease associated with hemophagocytic syndrome in adults. Early mortality is high, and outcome is influenced by the underlying disease.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
