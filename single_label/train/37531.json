{"id":37531,"title":"Screening programme for retinopathy of prematurity in Ilorin, Nigeria: a pilot study.","abstract":"The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of our hospital has a 30% survival rate among babies born premature weighing <1,000g. This hospital serves about 10 million people; there was no retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening program in place in Nigeria.Babies born premature were recruited based on preset criteria: ? 35 weeks Gestation Age and birth weight ? 1.9 kg. The first retina examination was done at 3-4 weeks post-delivery and were documented on a proforma and analyzed with SPSS 15 Statistical Package.58 eyes of 29 babies were examined. The birth weight range was 950-1900g, 17(58.6%) babies were ? 1500g, and 12 (41.4%) 1500-1900g. The Gestation age range was 27-35 weeks with a mean of 30. Avascularity in retina zones 2&3 was found in 52(89.6%) eyes mostly among babies <32 weeks gestation age and <1500g. Risk factors associated with retinal avascularity are highlighted. The challenges were with co-ordination of follow-up visits and accessibility to treatment such as laser and newer treatment methods.A cost effect screening criteria for ROP in Nigeria is suggested to include birth weight ? 1500g and gestational age ? 32 weeks. Dedicated staff & resources for treatment and imaging are needed for a successful program. An opportunity exists to study the effect of genetics on the development and severity of ROP among native African babies.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488284","annotations":[{"name":"Retinopathy of prematurity","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy_of_prematurity"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.834321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.814061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.741231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.597825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.552452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.387004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.352256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.259609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Ilorin, Nigeria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilorin,_Nigeria"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"1500","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"California Association of Regional Occupational Centers and Programs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Association_of_Regional_Occupational_Centers_and_Programs"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Accessibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Motor coordination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
