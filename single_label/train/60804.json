{"id":60804,"title":"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and dengue infection: rare case report.","abstract":"We describe a 21-year-old female patient returning from a journey to Cambodia, who developed dengue fever complicated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Hectic fever, rash, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hepatocellular dysfunction, a markedly elevated ferritin level, and a bone marrow demonstrating abundant hemophagocytosis were present. The patient recovered within 14 days. To our knowledge, this is only the second reported case of dengue virus-associated hemophagocytosis in Europe. As dengue is a rising pathogen in tropical import diseases, clinicians must be aware of its rare but serious complications.
