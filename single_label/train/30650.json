{"id":30650,"title":"[Spontaneous reportintg system data based on shuxuetong injection adverse reactions signal warning analysis].","abstract":"In this study, January 2009-December 2012 national adverse drug reaction monitoring center Shuxuetong the SRS data for the study, using the reporting rate ratio method and Bayesian belief propagation neural network Shuxuetong ADR warning signal, and balanced use of propensity score methods confounders. The results showed that chills as a possible warning signal. Tip clinical use Shuxuetong injection when, for the elderly, children, liver and kidney dysfunction are more prone to adverse reactions in patients with other special populations, the need to pay attention to the prevention of systemic allergic reactions, in particular the prevention shivering.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471318","annotations":[{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.908618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.711048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.658183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.605737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.424062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.405869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.355134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.307366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Shivering","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivering"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0827578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Belief","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief"},{"name":"Chills","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chills"},{"name":"Belief propagation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_propagation"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Sex reassignment surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Bayesian probability","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability"},{"name":"Dubbing (filmmaking)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Tipperary GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipperary_GAA"}]}
