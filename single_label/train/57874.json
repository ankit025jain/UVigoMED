{"id":57874,"title":"[Prenatal exposure to lipolysaccharide result in expression changes of myocardial renin angiotensin system in offspring rats].","abstract":"To explore expression changes of myocardial renin angiotensin system induced by prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharide in offspring rats.Twelve pregnant SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: LPS model group: intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.79 mg/kg) at 8, 10, 12 days of pregnancy; control group: intraperitoneal injection of sterile saline (0.5 ml) at 8, 10, 12 days of pregnancy; LPS + PDTC group: intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.79 mg/kg) at 8, 10, 12 days of pregnancy plus daily intraperitoneal injection of NF-?B inhibitor -pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 100 mg/kg) on day 8 to 14 pregnancy day. Protein expression of AngiotensinII(AngII) in heart was detected by immunohistochemistry; myocardial ACE,ACE2 mRNA expression was detected by real-time PCR; protein expression of ACE and ACE2 in heart was detected by Western blot in offspring rats of various groups.Compared with control group (0.07 ± 0.02,0.11 ± 0.01), AngII protein levels (0.14 ± 0.04) were significantly increased at 6 weeks (P < 0.01) and 16 weeks (0.17 ± 0.04, P < 0.05) in offspring rats of LPS model group, which could be significantly attenuated by PDTC intervention (0.10 ± 0.01,0.13 ± 0.03, respectively, all P < 0.05).Similarly, myocardial ACE mRNA expression in 16 weeks offspring rats of LPS model group was significantly upregulated compared with control group (1.10 ± 0.26 vs.0.72 ± 0.22, P < 0.05), which was significantly attenuated by PDTC intervention (0.67 ± 0.01, P < 0.01 vs.LPS group). Myocardial protein expression ACE2 in 16 weeks offspring rats of LPS model group was significantly downregulated compared to control group, which was slightly upregulated by PDTC intervention (P > 0.05).Pregnancy exposure to lipopolysaccharide increases myocardial ACE and AngII expression while reduces myocardial ACE2 expression in offspring rats, which might be one of the pathomechanisms of offspring hypertension.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25042922","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.946214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Renin","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renin"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.681948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.604043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.522884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.470446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.461637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.311797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.190947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.145004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.112555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Renin-angiotensin system","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renin-angiotensin_system"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
