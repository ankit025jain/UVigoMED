{"id":51237,"title":"[Rare abnormalities of parathyroid gland function and parathyroid hormone receptor action].","abstract":"The parathyroid glands, located near or within the posterior surface of the thyroid gland and secreting parathyroid hormone, are essential organs for the regulation of calcium and phosphate metabolism. As they are necessary to sustain life and maintain homeostasis, undetected or misdiagnosed parathyroid disorders may pose a significant threat to health outcomes, as their presence may increase morbidity and mortality in affected individuals. The clinical picture of some disorders associated with abnormal parathyroid hormone secretion and receptor action is sometimes complicated by coexisting abnormalities, and in these cases establishing the correct diagnosis is challenging. The remarkable progress of recent years in the area of hormonal assessment, imaging procedures and molecular biology, has resulted in a great improvement in the identification, differentiation and treatment of various parathyroid disorders and has made it possible to identify several new clinical entities. In this paper, we discuss the present state-of-art on the etiopathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of chosen rare abnormalities of parathyroid gland function and parathyroid hormone receptor action.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712267","annotations":[{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.744544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.744206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.564224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.44146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.374283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.344321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.315764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone_receptor"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Hormone receptor","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_receptor"},{"name":"Polycarbonate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycarbonate"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"}]}
