{"id":12687,"title":"The effects of remote ischemic preconditioning and N-acetylcysteine with remote ischemic preconditioning in rat hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury model.","abstract":"Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIP) and pharmacological preconditioning are the effective methods that can be used to prevent ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of RIP and N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) with RIP in the rat hepatic IR injury model.28 rats were divided into 4 groups. Group I (sham): only laparotomy was performed. Group II (IR): following 30 minutes of hepatic pedicle occlusion, 4 hours of reperfusion was performed. Group III (RIP + IR): following 3 cycles of RIP, hepatic IR was performed. Group IV (RIP + NAC + IR): following RIP and intraperitoneal administration of NAC (150 mg/kg), hepatic IR was performed. All the rats were sacrificed after blood samples were taken for the measurements of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and liver was processed for conventional histopathology.The hepatic histopathological injury scores of RIP + IR and RIP + NAC + IR groups were significantly lower than IR group (P = 0.006, P = 0.003, resp.). There were no significant differences in AST and ALT values between the IR, RIP + IR, and RIP + NAC + IR groups.In the present study, it was demonstrated histopathologically that RIP and RIP + NAC decreased hepatic IR injury significantly.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511549","annotations":[{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.804575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.784357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.757731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.709712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.642974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.621514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.577319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.551215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.504713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.474958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.361019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.188801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ischemic preconditioning","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_preconditioning"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Effective results in number theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_results_in_number_theory"},{"name":"NAC Breda","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAC_Breda"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Carbon group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_group"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Preconditioner","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preconditioner"}]}
