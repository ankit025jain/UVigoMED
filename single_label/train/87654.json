{"id":87654,"title":"Outcomes for high-energy distal femur articular fractures.","abstract":"Distal femur fractures are relatively rare injuries that usually require surgical treatment. Angular-stable plates allowing for anatomical repositioning and stable fixation of splinters, particularly in articular fractures, are commonly used in such cases. The goal of the study was to analyze the outcomes of the surgical treatment of high-energy articular fractures of distal femur.The study included 22 patients treated in years 2007-2013. The average follow-up period was 39.5 months. The range of knee motion was recorded during follow-up visits. Treatment outcomes are presented using the Prichett's criteria as well as using IKDC and KOOS scores. Bone union and lower limb axial deformity were assessed using X-ray images.The average range of motion was 0-99 degrees. According to Prichett's criteria, a total of 54% good and very good results as well as 36% of satisfactory results were recorded. The average IKDC score was 59.4 points while the average KOOS score was 54.7 points Bone union was achieved in 91.6% of fractures. Axial deformity was rare, and correlation between the valgus angle and the clinical and functional outcomes was observed.The applied methods for internal fixation afforded satisfactory treatment outcomes in most patients with high-energy distal femur fractures. No significant reduction in the mobility of the affected knee or axial deformation are observed after proper repositioning of distal femur fracture splinters using an angular-stable plate.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25046551","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.881596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.818951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.689089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.655043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.640569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.625018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.53115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.252483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.236379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.222908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lower limb","weight":0.162972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_limb"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Valgus deformity","weight":0.0589684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgus_deformity"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Deformation (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Positioning (marketing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)"}]}
