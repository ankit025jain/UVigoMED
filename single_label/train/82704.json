{"id":82704,"title":"Diagnosis of oral mucous membrane pemphigoid by means of combined serologic testing.","abstract":"Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) is a rare autoimmune bullous disease caused by various autoantibodies. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of MMP-specific autoantibodies in patient sera.We analyzed sera from 30 MMP-suspected patients with intractable oral mucosal lesions using a combination of indirect immunofluorescence with 1M NaCl-split skin, immunoblot analysis, and ELISAs. We also analyzed clinical features among different types of MMP.Seventeen, 4, and 3 patients were diagnosed with anti-BP180-type MMP, anti-laminin-332-type MMP, and combined anti-BP180/anti-laminin-332-type MMP, respectively.Our results indicated that a combination of immunologic testing for circulating autoantibodies is useful for the diagnosis of MMP.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556492","annotations":[{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.821942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.786011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.785026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Cicatricial pemphigoid","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicatricial_pemphigoid"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.753081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pemphigoid","weight":0.0649317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemphigoid"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"}]}
