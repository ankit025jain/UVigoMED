{"id":1063,"title":"Meta-analysis of cholesteryl ester transfer protein TaqIB polymorphism and risk of myocardial infarction.","abstract":"A number of studies have been conducted to explore the association between the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) TaqIB polymorphism and risk of myocardial infarction (MI); however, the results are inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to clarify the issue based on all the data available.Eligible studies were retrieved by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We calculated the crude odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) to assess the association between the TaqIB polymorphism and risk of MI.We included 13 studies involving 8733 MI cases and 8573 controls in the meta-analysis. The pooled results from all included studies showed decreased MI risk in the analysis of the B2B2 versus B1B1 (OR?=?0.78, 95% CI?=?0.68-0.91), dominant (OR?=?0.88, 95% CI?=?0.77-0.99), and recessive genetic models (OR?=?0.84, 95% CI?=?0.78-0.91). The frequency of the B2B2 genotype in MI patients was lower (OR?=?0.87, 95% CI?=?0.81-0.94). However, there was no significant association in the B1B2 versus B1B1 analysis (OR?=?0.92, 95% CI?=?0.81-1.05) and no significant difference for the B1B1 genotype (OR?=?1.04, 95% CI?=?0.98-1.11) and B1B2 genotype (OR?=?1.03, 95% CI?=?0.97-1.08). Cumulative analysis confirmed these results.Our results suggest that the B2B2 genotype of the CETP TaqIB polymorphism is a protective factor against the development of MI.
