{"id":59168,"title":"Measuring the meaning of miscarriage: revision of the Impact of Miscarriage Scale.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine a factor structure for the Impact of Miscarriage Scale (IMS). The 24 items comprising the IMS were originally derived from a phenomenological study of miscarriage in women. Initial psychometric properties were established based on a sample of 188 women (Swanson, 1999a).Data from 341 couples were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA).CFA did not confirm the original structure. EFA explained 57% of the variance through an 18-item, 4-factor structure: isolation and guilt, loss of baby, devastating event, and adjustment. Except for the Adjustment subscale, Cronbach's alpha coefficients were > or = .78.Although a 3-factor solution is most defensible, with further refinement and additional items, the 4th factor (adjustment) may warrant retention.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851662","annotations":[{"name":"Variance","weight":0.176993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Factor analysis","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.125451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Confirmatory factor analysis","weight":0.0557848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmatory_factor_analysis"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Phenomenology (philosophy)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"341","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/341"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Warrant (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(law)"},{"name":"Swanson","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson"},{"name":"Guilt","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
