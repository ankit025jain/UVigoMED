{"id":52425,"title":"Comparing the contributions of well-being and disease status to employee productivity.","abstract":"To compare employee overall well-being to chronic disease status, which has a long-established relationship to productivity, as relative contributors to on-the-job productivity.Data from two annual surveys of three companies were used in longitudinal analyses of well-being as a predictor of productivity level and productivity change among 2629 employees with diabetes or without any chronic conditions.Well-being was the most significant predictor of productivity cross-sectionally in a model that included disease status and demographic characteristics. Longitudinally, changes in well-being contributed to changes in productivity above and beyond what could be explained by the presence of chronic disease or other fixed characteristics.These findings support the use of well-being as the broader framework for understanding, explaining, and improving employee productivity in both the healthy and those with disease.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603200","annotations":[{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.472954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Productivity","weight":0.44291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.324431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.223642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.187122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Longitude","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude"},{"name":"Employee","weight":0.028099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"}]}
