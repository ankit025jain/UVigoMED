{"id":72309,"title":"Prevalence of perfusion defects detected by stress 99mtechnetium sestamibi myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography in asymptomatic patients with breast cancer.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to investigate myocardial perfusion in relation to disease history and laboratory parameters of atherosclerosis risk in asymptomatic patients with breast carcinoma.One-hundred and eighty-one patients with breast carcinoma were studied. Myocardial perfusion was assessed using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mtechnetium sestamibi.Perfusion defects were detected in 12 patients (7%). Higher body-mass index, increased concentrations of D-dimers, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, glucose, triglycerides, and urinary albumin, a history of hypertension and of radiotherapy to the left chest wall were all associated with increased risk of perfusion defects. In a multivariate stepwise selection logistic regression model, body mass index, albuminuria and radiotherapy to the left hemithorax were significantly associated with the presence of perfusion defects.In addition to other factors, treatment history may be associated with the presence of perfusion defects in patients with breast cancer.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982388","annotations":[{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.862063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Single-photon emission computed tomography","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.685838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.624787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Albuminuria","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuminuria"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.497336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.389445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.307046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.213089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Technetium (99mTc) sestamibi","weight":0.0518106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium_(99mTc)_sestamibi"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Thoracic cavity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
