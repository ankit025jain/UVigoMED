{"id":23581,"title":"Illustration of the difficulty of identifying Streptococcus equi strains at the subspecies level through a case of endocarditis in an immunocompetent man.","abstract":"We report a case of endocarditis caused by Streptococcus equi in an immunocompetent patient who was subsequently cured after appropriate antibiotherapy and cardiac surgery. However, it was challenging to identify the strain to the subspecies level, which highlights the necessity of developing reliable molecular tools to discriminate between the subspecies.
