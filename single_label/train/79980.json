{"id":79980,"title":"Toxoplasma's arms race with the host interferon response: a ménage à trois of ROPs.","abstract":"The Toxoplasma gondii virulence factors ROP5 and ROP18 both target immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) to evade immunity. In this issue of Cell Host & Microbe, Etheridge et al. (2014) identify a third virulence factor, ROP17, which forms a complex and synergizes with ROP5/ROP18 to fully disable the IRG system of antiparasite defense.
