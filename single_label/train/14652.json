{"id":14652,"title":"Increased brain penetration and potency of a therapeutic antibody using a monovalent molecular shuttle.","abstract":"Although biotherapeutics have vast potential for treating brain disorders, their use has been limited due to low exposure across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We report that by manipulating the binding mode of an antibody fragment to the transferrin receptor (TfR), we have developed a Brain Shuttle module, which can be engineered into a standard therapeutic antibody for successful BBB transcytosis. Brain Shuttle version of an anti-A? antibody, which uses a monovalent binding mode to the TfR, increases ?-Amyloid target engagement in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease by 55-fold compared to the parent antibody. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that the monovalent binding mode facilitates transcellular transport, whereas a bivalent binding mode leads to lysosome sorting. Enhanced target engagement of the Brain Shuttle module translates into a significant improvement in amyloid reduction. These findings have major implications for the development of biologics-based treatment of brain disorders.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411731","annotations":[{"name":"Lysosome","weight":0.903277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome"},{"name":"Transferrin","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.810976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood-brain barrier","weight":0.669013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-brain_barrier"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Fragment antigen-binding","weight":0.37894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_antigen-binding"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.352145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.311544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.264423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Transcytosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcytosis"},{"name":"Transferrin receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin_receptor"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Space Shuttle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle"},{"name":"Divalent","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divalent"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Engagement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Assortative mating","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assortative_mating"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
