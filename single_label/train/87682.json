{"id":87682,"title":"[Case-control study on close manipulative reduction combined with minimally invasive percutaneous plate fixation for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures].","abstract":"To compare the clinical effects of close manipulative reduction combined with minimally invasive percutaneous plate fixation(MIPPO) and conventional open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for the treatment of proximal humerus fractures.From April 2008 to March 2013, among the 75 patients with fractures of proximal humerus, 26 patients were male and 49 patients were female, ranging in age from 22 to 80 years; 18 patients had injuries caused by traffic accident and 57 patients had injuries caused by falling down. According to Neer classification, there were 49 cases of two-part fractures and 26 cases of three-part fractures. All the patients were divided into two groups: MIPPO group and ORIF group. There were 12 males and 21 females in the MIPPO group,including 22 cases of Neer two parts and 11 cases of Neer three parts, who were treated with close manipulative reduction combined with MIPPO. While the other 42 patients were in the ORIF group,including 16 males and 26 females. Among those patients,27 cases belonged to Neer two parts and 15 cases of Neer three parts, who were treated with ORIF. Length of the incision, blood loss, operating time, early postoperative pain(recorded by VAS), neck-shaft angle of proximal humerus and postoperative function of shoulder(recorded by Constant-Murley score, including pain, function, ROM and muscle length) were compared.The mean lengths of incision were (6.74 +/- 0.38) cm in MIPPO group and (16.82 +/- 1.74) cm in ORIF group;blood losses were (110.15 +/- 29.49) ml in MIPPO group and (326.19 +/- 59.71) ml in ORIF group; operation times were (48.60 +/- 10.18) min in MIPPO group and (68.84-16.22) min in ORIF group. VAS of patients in MIPPO group on the 1st and 3rd days postoperatively were lower than those of patients in the ORIF group. The postoperative radiographs verified good position of all screws and satisfactory reduction of bone fracture reduction in both groups. All the patients were followed up,and the durig ranged from 8 to 24 months (mean 14.2 months). In the MIPPO group, there was no humeral head necrosis and all patients gained bone union; while in the ORIF group, 3 patients sustained nonunion and received reoperation for bone grafting, and 2 patients sustained humeral head necrosis. The mean Constant-Murley scores of shoulder were 88.94 +/- 2.57 in the MIPPO group and 86.00 +/- 3.36 in the ORIF group.The close manipulative reduction combined with MIPPO is a better choice for fixation of proximal humerus fractures, compared with conventional plate. This method possesses such advantages as a shorter incision, less disturbance of the blood supply and stable fixation of the fracture, allowing early exercise so that the function of shoulder recovers rapidly.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029840","annotations":[{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.924562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.773001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.595998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.556612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.522381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.520555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.433153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.308579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.223431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Reduction (orthopedic surgery)","weight":0.113797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(orthopedic_surgery)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.113499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0805107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0471213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.024844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"}]}
