{"id":50051,"title":"Distance as a risk factor for amputation in patients with diabetes: a case-control study.","abstract":"We studied the association between amputation and distance of patients' residences to a diabetes care centre. We performed a case-control study matching each case (amputation) with 5 controls (no amputation) by age and sex. We compared the distance of residence to the diabetes centre, duration and type of diabetes, haemoglobin-A1c levels and foot examination findings for cases and controls. We analysed the association between distance and the strongest predictors of amputation. Sixty-six cases of amputation and 313 controls were identified. Distance of residence was 12.1km greater for cases (p = 0.028). In multivariate analysis, only diabetes duration (OR/year 1.07, 1.03 to 1.11) and neuropathy (OR 10.73, 4.55 to 25.74) were significantly associated with amputation. Patients with neuropathy resided 97 km further than those without neuropathy (p = 0.01). Patients requiring amputation reside at greater distances from the diabetes centre, possibly due to higher rates of neuropathy.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834582","annotations":[{"name":"Risk","weight":0.435884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.198761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Oregon Route 10","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Route_10"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"313","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/313"},{"name":"Distance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance"},{"name":"Kilometre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.0163128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Somnambulist (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnambulist_(Angel)"},{"name":"The Gamble (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamble_(The_O.C.)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"}]}
