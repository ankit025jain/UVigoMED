{"id":63165,"title":"Piceatannol exhibits selective toxicity to multiple myeloma cells and influences the Wnt/ beta-catenin pathway.","abstract":"Aberrant activation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling promotes development and progression of various malignant neoplasms. Recent studies observed that the Wnt pathway is constitutively active in myeloma cells and promotes an exaggerated proliferation. Thus, the Wnt signaling pathway might be an attractive therapeutic target for multiple myeloma. In this study, we identified piceatannol as an inhibitor of the Wnt/?-catenin pathway and as a potent inducer of apoptosis in myeloma cells. Interestingly, healthy cells remained mainly unaffected. These results reveal a significant selective induction of apoptosis by piceatannol and suggest a significant in vivo effect against multiple myeloma.","date":"2014-12-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24470348","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Wnt signaling pathway","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.526962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.508649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.348227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.175337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Inducer","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inducer"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Secretory pathway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretory_pathway"}]}
