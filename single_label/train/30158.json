{"id":30158,"title":"The H-Impairment Index (HII): a standardized assessment of alcohol-induced impairment in the Emergency Department.","abstract":"Emergency Departments (EDs) care for thousands of alcohol-intoxicated patients annually. No clinically relevant bedside measures currently exist to describe degree of impairment.To assess a group of bedside tests (\"Hack's Impairment Index [HII] score\") that applies a numerical value to the degree of alcohol-induced impairment in ED patients.A six-month retrospective review of HII score data was performed in a convenience sample of 293 intoxicated ED patients. Patients were scored 0-4 on five tasks, divided by the maximum score (20 if all tasks completed), every 2 hours; and classified by the number of visits: Low-frequency (1 visit); Medium-frequency (2 visits); High-frequency (?3 visits). Correlations were assessed between HII score, healthcare provider judgment of intoxication, and measured alcohol levels.Study patients had 513 visits; 236 were low-frequency, 26 middle-frequency and 31 high-frequency. Clinical assessment and HII score were strongly correlated (Spearman's rho?=?0.82, p?<<?0.001); clinical assessment and alcohol level less strongly so (rho?=?0.49, p?<<?0.001). Among low-frequency patients, HII score and alcohol level were weakly correlated (r?=?0.324, p?<?0.001), with no such correlation among high-frequency visitors (r?=?-0.04, p?=?0.89). The mean decline between serial HII scores was 0.126 (95% CI: 0.098-0.154).This pilot study shows the HII score can be performed at the bedside of alcohol-intoxicated patients. The HII declines in a reasonably predictable manner over time; and applies a quantitative, objective assessment of alcohol impairment.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555813","annotations":[{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.636184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Standardized test","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.359623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.328677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.137118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Numerical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"324","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/324"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"293","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/293"},{"name":"Convergence of random variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_random_variables"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"The Emergency (Ireland)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Rho","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho"},{"name":"Alcohol by volume","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume"},{"name":"Number","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Judgement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Strongly correlated material","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_correlated_material"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
