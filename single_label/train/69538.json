{"id":69538,"title":"[The effectiveness of use of prolit in patients with ureteral stone].","abstract":"The study was aimed to the evaluation of the efficacy of prolit in patients with urolithiasis and localization of stone in the ureter. 225 patients with various localization of solitary ureteral calculi ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 cm were under observation. Depending on the treatment, the patients were divided into two groups. The study group (n = 175) has received prolit for 30-40 days, control group (n = 50) has received standard therapy. As a result of treatment, spontaneous discharge of ureteral stone was registered in 158 (90.3%) patients of study group and only in 21 (42%) patients of control group. Renal colics during treatment were recorded four times more often among patients of control group. The intensity of pain in patients receiving prolit was less pronounced.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437238","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.275692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.0900983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Urolithiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urolithiasis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"225","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/225"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Commodore 4040","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_4040"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Calculus (medicine)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(medicine)"}]}
