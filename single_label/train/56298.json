{"id":56298,"title":"Bilateral vitreomacular traction resolved with a single intravitreal ocriplasmin injection.","abstract":"A 74-year-old woman was referred by her ophthalmologist for evaluation of blurred vision in both eyes over the course of several months, presenting with a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/150 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography showed vitreomacular traction (VMT) bilaterally with a full-thickness macular hole in the right eye; a single intravitreal injection of 125 ?g ocriplasmin was administered in the right eye. One week after the injection, BCVA in the right eye improved to 20/60 with release of VMT, and at 3 weeks bilateral release of VMT was observed.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708167","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.785427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.585583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.505245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Blurred vision","weight":0.425681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurred_vision"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.411377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.333385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.275382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"2060s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2060s"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"2050","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2050"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Human anatomical terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
