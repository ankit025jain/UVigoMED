{"id":11748,"title":"Antinociceptive effects of novel melatonin receptor agonists in mouse models of abdominal pain.","abstract":"To characterize the antinociceptive action of the novel melatonin receptor (MT) agonists, Neu-P11 and Neu-P12 in animal models of visceral pain.Visceral pain was induced by intracolonic (ic) application of mustard oil or capsaicin solution or by intraperitoneal (ip) administration of acetic acid. Neu-P11, Neu-P12, or melatonin were given ip or orally and their effects on pain-induced behavioral responses were evaluated. To identify the receptors involved, the non-selective MT1/MT2 receptor antagonist luzindole, the MT2 receptor antagonist 4-P-PDOT, or the ?-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone were injected ip or intracerebroventricularly (icv) prior to the induction of pain.Orally and ip administered melatonin, Neu-P11, and Neu-P12 reduced pain responses in a dose-dependent manner. Neu-P12 was more effective and displayed longer duration of action compared to melatonin. The antinociceptive effects of Neu-P11 or Neu-P12 were antagonized by ip or icv. administered naloxone. Intracerebroventricularly, but not ip administration of luzindole or 4-P-PDOT blocked the antinociceptive actions of Neu-P11 or Neu-P12.Neu-P12 produced the most potent and long-lasting antinociceptive effect. Further development of Neu-P12 for future treatment of abdominal pain seems promising.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574803","annotations":[{"name":"Naloxone","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone"},{"name":"Melatonin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin"},{"name":"Capsaicin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.847128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.769734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Opioid receptor","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_receptor"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.624967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.402309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Melatonin receptor","weight":0.388007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin_receptor"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.327971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.302877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.218501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Opioid antagonist","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_antagonist"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Mustard oil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_oil"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Melatonin receptor 1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin_receptor_1A"},{"name":"Melatonin receptor 1B","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin_receptor_1B"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"}]}
