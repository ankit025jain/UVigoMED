{"id":41769,"title":"An association of elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase with acute cholangitis.","abstract":"The early diagnosis of acute cholangitis (AC) is critical for appropriate treatment.Patient records from April 2008 to December 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Data on white blood cell count and levels of C-reactive protein, total-bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP) were collected from AC patients on the day they underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for diagnosis and treatment. Data were collected 3 months before ERCP to analyze the rate of change of these variables. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was performed.We enrolled 63 patients with AC and 65 patients with non-AC. The threshold values of ALP and gamma-GTP were 1.09 and 1.30, respectively.450 (IU/L) and 100 (IU/L), respectively, were thresholds of ALP and gamma-GTP on the day of ERCP. 1.09 and 1.30, respectively, were thresholds of ALP and gamma-GTP rates of change for the diagnosis of AC.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901126","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.730506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.664956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.537697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.524538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.222309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Cholangitis","weight":0.117317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangitis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Hero (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(Angel)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
