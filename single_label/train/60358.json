{"id":60358,"title":"Sarcoidosis--the greatest mimic.","abstract":"Little is known regarding the exact pathogenesis of sarcoidosis, but it is widely recognized that it affects multiple organs. The presentation and imaging features can be nonspecific, and this is the reason why it is a great mimic of other diseases. Diagnosis of sarcoidosis is often prompted initially by clinical suspicion. Imaging plays a crucial role in both detection and monitoring of disease process. This review is a case-based systemic approach looking at various systemic manifestation of the disease presenting real clinical encounters using various imaging modalities.
