{"id":78532,"title":"Partial mastoid obliteration combined with soft-wall reconstruction for middle ear cholesteatoma.","abstract":"The objective was to analyze the surgical outcomes of tympanoplasty with partial mastoid obliteration and soft-wall reconstruction for middle ear cholesteatoma.Sixty-nine patients (73 ears) with fresh middle ear cholesteatomas, 42 men and 27 women aged 6 to 89 years, were retrospectively analyzed. The cholesteatomas were the pars flaccida and tensa types in 59 and 12 ears, respectively. The patients underwent canal-wall-down tympanoplasty with partial mastoid obliteration and soft-wall reconstruction. Follow-up computed tomography was performed 6 to 12 months after surgery. Hearing outcomes were evaluated by the arithmetic mean of the hearing levels at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz.Residual cholesteatoma occurred in 7 ears (9.6%) and recurrent cholesteatoma in 1 ear (1.4%). No cavity problem was seen. Primary evaluation of postoperative hearing was performed 6 to 12 months after ossiculoplasy. Of the 50 ears with available audiogram in this period, the postoperative air-bone gaps were ? 15 dB and ? 20 dB in 27 (54.0%) and 37 (74.0%) ears, respectively. The postoperative hearing level was within 30 dB in 22 ears (44.0%). The hearing gain was ? 15 dB in 24 ears (48.0%).The surgical outcomes of tympanoplasty with partial mastoid obliteration and soft-wall reconstruction for middle ear cholesteatoma were satisfactory with a low incidence of cholesteatoma recidivism and tolerable postoperative hearing without cavity problems.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634153","annotations":[{"name":"Audiogram","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiogram"},{"name":"Cholesteatoma","weight":0.870545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesteatoma"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.80318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.769512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.711178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.440985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.40517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Equal-loudness contour","weight":0.328957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour"},{"name":"Mastoid process","weight":0.320925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_process"},{"name":"Tympanoplasty","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanoplasty"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Recidivism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism"},{"name":"Pars flaccida of tympanic membrane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pars_flaccida_of_tympanic_membrane"},{"name":"Arithmetic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"}]}
