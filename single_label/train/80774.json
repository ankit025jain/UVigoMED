{"id":80774,"title":"Long-term disseminated recurrence in spinal hydatid cyst: a case report.","abstract":"The spinal column is rarely affected by hydatid cyst; however, when involved, it has higher rates of recurrence particularly in case of osseous and paravertebral extensions. We report a 36-year-old patient. The patient was operated previously for hydatid cyst through laminectomy 13 years ago. After 13 years of surgery, the patient was admitted to our clinic with progressive paraparesis. Radiological evaluation revealed multicystic lesions affecting T4 and T5 vertebrae as well as the posterior thoracic wall and paravertebral musculature. Serological findings were also compatible with a hydatid cyst. The patient underwent surgical treatment; the cystic lesions were removed, and vertebral stabilization was provided. The treatment of hydatid cyst in the spine is challenging. Particularly in cases with vertebral involvement, spinal instability and recurrence are the main handicap. Preoperative and postoperative antihelminthic treatment as well as close clinical, radiological and serological follow up in postoperative period is important to avoid recurrence risk.
