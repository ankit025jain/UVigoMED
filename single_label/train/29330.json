{"id":29330,"title":"Sphingosine kinase-1 protects differentiated N2a cells against beta-amyloid25-35-induced neurotoxicity via the mitochondrial pathway.","abstract":"Although the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not fully understood, multiple lines of evidence suggests the importance of amyloid-? (A?) in the initiation/progression of the disease. A? has been shown to induce neuronal apoptosis via the sphingomyelin/ceramide pathway. This study was designed to elucidate whether the sphingosine kinase-1 (SPK1), a critical regulator of the ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate rheostat, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of death and survival of differentiated neuro-2a cells in response to beta-amyloid peptide fragment 25-35 (A?25-35). These results show that the expression of SPK1 was markedly decreased in A?25-35-induced neurotoxicity, as evidenced by the decreased cell viability and the increased apoptotic rate. Overexpression of SPK1 significantly attenuated A?25-35-induced neurotoxicity, whereas silencing the expression of SPK1 exacerbated it. Moreover, overexpression of SPK1 can significantly attenuate A?25-35-induced upregulation of Bax and rehabilitate the level of Bcl-2; concomitantly, it can ameliorate mitochondrial ultrastructure. These studies demonstrate that overexpression of SPK1 may moderate A?25-35-induced neurotoxicity by regulating the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and improving mitochondrial ultrastructure. Based on these findings, SPK1 is a potential therapeutic target for AD.
