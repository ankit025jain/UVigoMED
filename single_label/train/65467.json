{"id":65467,"title":"Tumor-suppressive microRNA-29s inhibit cancer cell migration and invasion via targeting LAMC1 in prostate cancer.","abstract":"Our recent studies of microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures revealed that microRNA-29s (miR-29s; including miR-29a/b/c) were significantly downregulated in prostate cancer (PCa) and was a putative tumor-suppressive miRNA family in PCa. Herein, we aimed to investigate the functional significance of miR-29 in cancer cells and to identify novel miR-29s-mediated cancer pathways and target genes involved in PCa oncogenesis and metastasis. Restoration of miR-29s in PC3 and DU145 cell lines revealed significant inhibition of cancer cell migration and invasion. To identify miR-29s-mediated molecular pathways and targets, we used gene expression data and in silico database analysis. Our analysis demonstrated that miR-29s modulated the focal adhesion pathway. Moreover, the laminin ?1 (LAMC1) gene was a candidate target of miR-29s regulation. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-29s directly regulated LAMC1. Silencing of LAMC1 significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in cancer cells, and LAMC1 was upregulated in PCa. miR-29s acted as tumor suppressors, contributing to cancer cell migration and invasion and directly targeting laminin signaling. Recognition of tumor-suppressive miRNA-mediated cancer pathways provides new insights into the potential mechanisms of PCa oncogenesis and metastasis, and suggests novel therapeutic strategies for treating this disease.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24820027","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Laminin","weight":0.757284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminin"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.73874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.723407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.721393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.627861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.589967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.577319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.480848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"DU145","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DU145"},{"name":"In silico","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Focal adhesion","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_adhesion"},{"name":"PC3","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC3"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Reporter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Depleted uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depleted_uranium"}]}
