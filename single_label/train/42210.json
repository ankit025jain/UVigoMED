{"id":42210,"title":"My treatment approach to chronic hepatitis C virus.","abstract":"The treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is evolving rapidly. In 2014, the standard of care and new backbone of HCV treatment is the polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (SOF). Our treatment approach in patients with HCV genotype 1 is 12 weeks of SOF, peginterferon (PEGINF), and ribavirin (RBV). In patients with cirrhosis or extrahepatic manifestations of HCV who cannot tolerate PEGINF, we use 12 weeks of SOF and simeprevir. The latter is less costly and more effective than SOF and RBV for 24 weeks. Our treatment approach in all patients with genotype 2 is SOF and RBV for 12 weeks. Hepatitis C virus genotype 3 is now the most costly and difficult to cure. Our approach to treatment-naive patients with genotype 3 is SOF and RBV for 24 weeks. In patients who have previously undergone PEGINF and RBV treatment, we use PEGINF, SOF, and RBV for 12 weeks, which is equally if not more effective and less costly than SOF and RBV for 24 weeks. Patients with cirrhosis who cannot tolerate PEGINF should be treated for 24 weeks with SOF and RBV, although the sustained virologic response is suboptimal.
