{"id":7608,"title":"Induction of interleukin-8 and interleukin-12 in neonatal ovine lung following experimental inoculation of bovine respiratory syncytial virus.","abstract":"This study aimed to determine the immunohistochemical expression of interleukin (IL)-1?, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-?, interferon (IFN)-?, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12 and to measure the concentrations of these cytokines in lung tissue from lambs infected experimentally with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV). Lambs (n = 15) were inoculated at 2 days of age with 20 ml of viral inoculum (1.26 Ã— 10(6) TCID50 per ml) or sterile medium (n = 15). Rectal temperature, pulse and respiratory rates were monitored daily in control and infected lambs. Lambs were killed and subject to necropsy examination at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 15 days post inoculation (dpi). There was a temporal association between pulmonary expression of these cytokines and lung pathology in BRSV-infected lambs. The cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 were not elevated, but there was a significant increase in IL-1?, TNF-?, IFN-? and IL-6 proteins and labelled cells, suggesting that these cytokines may play a role in the biological response to BRSV infection and contribute to the development of lung lesions. There was also a significant increase in the cytokine concentration and number of immunolabelled cells expressing IL-8 and IL-12 in infected lungs, suggesting that these cytokines might be used as therapeutic targets in the management of BRSV, in conjunction with measures to combat the causative pathogen and prophylactic methods aimed at preventing infection.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Animal
