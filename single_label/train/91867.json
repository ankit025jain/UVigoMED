{"id":91867,"title":"Posterior atlantoaxial dislocation complicating odontoid fracture without neurologic deficit: a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Traumatic posterior atlantoaxial dislocation associated with odontoid fracture is extremely rare, with only eight cases reported thus far in the English literature. This report concerns a 47-year-old female who presented with considerable pain and stiffness in the neck without a neurologic deficit after injury due to a fall. Radiographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a posterior dislocation of the atlas with respect to the axis with an odontoid fracture. No cord compression or intramedullary cord signal abnormalities were detected at the level of the atlantoaxial dislocation. A pedicle screw fixation/fusion was performed via a posterior approach following successful closed reduction.
