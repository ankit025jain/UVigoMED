{"id":91202,"title":"Imaging and clinical tests for the diagnosis of long-standing groin pain in athletes. A systematic review.","abstract":"To examine the validity of clinical tests available for the diagnosis of longstanding groin pain in athletes.Systematic review.A published search strategy of MeSH terms in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and SportDiscuss.diagnostic studies relating to athletic groin pain, professional or semi-professional athletes, symptoms lasting for more than six weeks, and not limited by age or gender. A priori exclusion criteria were utilised.QUADAS tool, sensitivity and specificity, likelihood ratios and predictive values of the reported tests and investigations.577 Journal articles were identified. Five studies met all requirements. Sensitivity and specificity of clinical tests ranged between 30 and 100% and 88 and 95% respectively with negative likelihood ratio of 0.15-0.78 and positive likelihood ratios of 1.0-11.0. Sensitivity and specificity of investigations (MRI, herniography, and dynamic ultrasound) ranged between 68% and 100% as well as 33% and 100% respectively with negative likelihood ratios between 0 and 0.32 and positive likelihood ratios between 1.5 and 8.1.There is a lack of validated diagnostic clinical tests available for clinicians and a lack of symptomology being evaluated. It is recommended that a reference standard should be applied and data should be reported in sufficient detail to calculate diagnostic statistics that is useful to the clinician.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529632","annotations":[{"name":"Medical Subject Headings","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Subject_Headings"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.38857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.146445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Likelihood-ratio test","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood-ratio_test"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Groin","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groin"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Psychodynamics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodynamics"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"A priori and a posteriori","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori"}]}
