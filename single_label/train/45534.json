{"id":45534,"title":"Primary oesophageal melanoma - a case report.","abstract":"Primary upper gastrointestinal tract melanoma is a rare but well recognised entity, with a poor prognosis because of delay in diagnosis. Furthermore, it may be difficult to determine whether a gastrointestinal melanoma represents a metastasis or a primary tumour. We report a 67-year-old man with a primary oesophageal melanoma, treated with surgical resection, who remains disease-free two years post resection.
