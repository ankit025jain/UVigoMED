{"id":82936,"title":"The sensitivity and specificity of frozen-section histopathology in the management of benign oral and maxillofacial lesions.","abstract":"The management of odontogenic cysts and tumors typically requires a biopsy, which may present significant challenges and prompt an additional visit to the operating room before definitive treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the validity of frozen-section diagnosis in the management of benign oral and maxillofacial lesions, allowing intraoperative diagnosis followed by definitive treatment under the same general anesthetic.A retrospective chart review of patients treated at the University of Michigan Health System was performed. Patients of all ages who had a diagnosis of a benign maxillofacial lesion by frozen-section and permanent histopathology reports were included for analysis. Patients were identified using the Current Procedural Terminology code for enucleation and curettage and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for benign cysts or tumors of skull, face, or lower jaw.Of 450 patients reviewed, 214 had intraoperative frozen-section examination available for comparison with permanent histopathology. There were 121 men (56.5%) and 93 women (43.5%), with a mean age of 41 years. Compared with final permanent histopathology, the overall sensitivity of frozen sections was 92.1%. Frozen-section histopathology had a sensitivity greater than 90% and a specificity greater than 95% for the diagnosis of dentigerous cyst and keratocyst odontogenic tumor.In this study of 214 patients with benign maxillofacial lesions, frozen-section histopathology was found to be a valid diagnostic modality with high sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. These results and analysis support the use of frozen-section histopathology for the treatment of benign maxillofacial lesions and underscore its value in the management of these lesions.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485198","annotations":[{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.810789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery"},{"name":"Curettage","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curettage"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.673924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"General anaesthetic","weight":0.671356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthetic"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.649945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.44917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.387411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.337543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.304159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Odontogenic","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontogenic"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"University of Michigan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan"},{"name":"Current Procedural Terminology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_Procedural_Terminology"},{"name":"Dentigerous cyst","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentigerous_cyst"},{"name":"Odontogenic cyst","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontogenic_cyst"},{"name":"Cryogenics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Frozen section procedure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_section_procedure"},{"name":"Michigan","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
