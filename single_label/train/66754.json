{"id":66754,"title":"Anti-inflammatory effect of Marchantin M contributes to sensitization of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel.","abstract":"As pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines contribute to the malignancy of many types of human cancer, we examined the anti-inflammatory effect of bisbibenzyls, a diverse bioactive group of naturally occurring compounds. Marchantin M (Mar M) was identified through a screening process of these compounds as a potent anti-inflammatory agent based on its capacity to inhibit LPS-induced IL6, IL1? and CCL2 expression in HUVECs and PBMCs without affecting cell proliferation. Since Mar M has been found to exhibit anticancer activity, we observed that Mar M treatment also resulted in decreases in the expressions of IL6, IL1? and TNF? in metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) cells. This effect was further confirmed in other cancer cell lines that express high level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, inactivation of NF-?B, a critical transcription factor controlling many pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions, was observed in Mar M-treated PCa cells as evidenced by decreased phosphor-p65 and subsequently phosphor-STAT3. Mar M also suppressed phosphorylation of IKB?, an inhibitor of NF-?B in the cytosol. However, reduced phosphor-p65 by Mar M was slightly increased when knockdown of IKB?, suggesting that Mar M may target upstream molecules of IKB?/NF-?B signaling. Finally, treatment with Mar M resulted in more enhanced-sensitivity of PCa cells to docetaxel-induced apoptosis than that of the IL6 blocking. Our study demonstrates the potential of the anti-inflammatory agent Mar M as an adjuvant to improve the efficacy of traditional anticancer agents such as docetaxel.
