{"id":90026,"title":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation transport after traumatic aortic valve injury.","abstract":"Traumatic injury to the aortic valve is an uncommon clinical entity. Rarer still is the transport of such a patient using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to a specialized ECMO center for definitive repair. We present a case of traumatic rupture of the aortic valve complicated by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with interhospital transport using ECMO and subsequent aortic valve replacement.
