{"id":74213,"title":"Clinical impact of biopsy method on the quality of surgical management in melanoma.","abstract":"Though guidelines recommend excisional biopsy for diagnosing melanoma, partial biopsy techniques are commonly performed, risking underestimation of Breslow depth and altering surgical management. Biopsy choice patterns by specialty and subsequent impact on surgical management was examined.Retrospective review of the University of Vermont Cancer Registry. All patients with a single, primary cutaneous melanoma from 1/02 to 6/12 analyzed.Among 853 lesions analyzed, 606 had Breslow depth <1?mm. Dermatologists perform 62.6% of biopsies, favoring shave biopsies; surgeons favor excisional biopsies (48%), and primary care doctors favor punch biopsies (44.8%), (P?<?0.001). Final Breslow depth was upstaged in 107 (12.5%); however, only 23 of 488 partial biopsies (4.7%) displayed a discrepancy great enough to change surgical recommendations (P?<?0.001). There was no statistically significant relationship with presence of ulceration, regression, high Clark level, or high mitotic index.Partial biopsy techniques are commonly performed in diagnosing melanoma; especially among dermatologists, who perform the majority of biopsies. Though partial biopsies were less accurate in determining Breslow thickness; they rarely alter recommendations for surgical management. Predictive features could not be determined to identify the few cases where a Breslow discrepancy was clinically relevant.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24862925","annotations":[{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.519125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.460249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.409281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.323049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.224806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.135492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Mitotic index","weight":0.123079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitotic_index"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"University of Vermont","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vermont"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Vermont","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"853","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/853"},{"name":"Shaving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"},{"name":"Ronald Breslow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Breslow"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"}]}
