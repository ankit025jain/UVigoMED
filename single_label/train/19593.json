{"id":19593,"title":"Prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms and risk factors for carriage in long-term care facilities: a nested case-control study.","abstract":"Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are a potentially important reservoir of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms; however, limited data exist.A point-prevalence study was conducted in four co-located LTCFs in Australia. Nasal and rectal swabs were cultured for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and MDR Gram-negative bacilli (GNB). Molecular typing and resistance detection were performed. Risk factors for colonization with an MDR organism were determined using a nested case-control study.Consent was obtained from 115 (85%) of 136 eligible participants. Forty-one (36%) residents carried at least one type of MDR organism. The prevalence was 16% MRSA (n?=?18), 6% VRE (n?=?7) and 21% MDR GNB [n?=?24; including extended-spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (n?=?12) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n?=?6)]. The majority of ESBL-producing E. coli and A. baumannii were clonal. Current wound management [adjusted OR (AOR) 8.81 (95% CI 2.78-27.94), P?<?0.001], medical device in situ [AOR 5.58 (95% CI 1.34-23.32), P?=?0.018] and pressure ulcer [AOR 3.69 (95% CI 1.06-12.86), P?=?0.04] were independent risk factors for MDR organism colonization. Advanced dementia [AOR 3.54 (95% CI 1.23-10.23), P?=?0.02] and prolonged antibiotic use [AOR 2.95 (95% CI 1.01-8.60), P?=?0.047] were independently associated with MRSA colonization, whilst current wound management [AOR 15.59 (95% CI 4.85-50.10), P?<?0.001] and fluoroquinolone use [AOR 4.27 (95% CI 1.20-15.25), P?=?0.025] were risk factors for MDR GNB colonization.LTCFs are an important reservoir of MDR organisms, with person-to-person transmissions being a potential issue. We have identified several predictors of colonization with MDR organisms, allowing a more targeted management of high-risk residents.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710025","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.809898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.802221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.717548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.642946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.636573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Acinetobacter baumannii","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter_baumannii"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.288801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.279552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.0639325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Bedsore","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedsore"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin-resistant_Enterococcus"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Electromagnetic radiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
