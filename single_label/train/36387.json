{"id":36387,"title":"Modified Nikaidoh procedure with double-root translocation in a 1-year-old boy.","abstract":"A 1-year-old boy weighing 10.4 kg underwent successful biventricular repair for transposition of the great arteries, a ventricular septal defect, and a left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction with moderate pulmonary stenosis of the bicuspid pulmonary valve (z score ofÂ -4.4 for the pulmonary valve) by means of a modified Nikaidoh procedure with double root translocation by use of a valve-spared pulmonary root. The postoperative echocardiogram showed no LVOT obstruction, no aortic valve regurgitation, and mild pulmonary stenosis and pulmonary valve regurgitation. No reintervention has been required during the 6-year follow-up, with annular growth of the pulmonary valve.
