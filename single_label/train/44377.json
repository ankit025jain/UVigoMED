{"id":44377,"title":"The incidence of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma in the United Kingdom and The Netherlands is levelling off.","abstract":"Barrett's oesophagus (BO) is a risk factor for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). Several studies report increasing incidences of BO with substantial variation.To determine age- and sex-stratified incidence rates (IR) of BO and OAC.Cohort study using two primary care databases in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands (NL) (2000-2012). BO and OAC cases were identified using disease-specific READ codes (UK) and free-text search with manual validation (NL). Age- and sex-specific incidence rates (IRs) were calculated for both BO and OAC.From the study population of 6,885,420 subjects in the UK, we identified 12,312 incident BO and 40 (0.3%) subsequent incident OAC cases. There were 1383 incident BO, and subsequent 5 (0.4%) incident OAC cases among the 1,487,191 subjects in the NL. The IR of BO increased linearly with age: 15.6/100,000 PYs (UK) and 23.7/100,000 PYs (NL) for patients aged 40-44 years, increasing to 85.6/100,000 PYs (UK) and 87.0/100,000 PYs (NL) for 70-74 years. In both the UK and the NL, IR of BO was 2-4 times higher in males than females across all age groups. With respect to calendar time, the IR of BO increased by 35% (UK) and 41% (NL) from 2000 to 2003, after which IRs remained stable until 2012.The incidence rates of BO in the UK and the NL increased until 2003, but levelled off thereafter. Around 0.3% of patients with BO developed OAC at least 1 year after BO diagnosis. These findings may help tailor endoscopic surveillance strategies among patients with BO.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738722","annotations":[{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.798006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.76913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.588224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.540771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.535987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.498387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.497222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.297409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.0489124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Bolivia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia"},{"name":"Calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar"},{"name":"Calendar date","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_date"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"885","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/885"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"1383","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1383"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Barrett","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett"},{"name":"Ontario Academic Credit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Academic_Credit"},{"name":"Tailor","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailor"},{"name":"Computer security","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"IBM 700/7000 series","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_700/7000_series"},{"name":"Cohort (military unit)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)"},{"name":"Power Macintosh 7100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_7100"},{"name":"Power Macintosh 6100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_6100"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Uncial 0100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0100"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"}]}
