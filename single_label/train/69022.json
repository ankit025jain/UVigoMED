{"id":69022,"title":"[Consultation hours for adolescent males: because men's health begins in adolescence].","abstract":"Young men are underrepresented in terms of offers concerning primary and secondary prevention in medicine. As a consequence, urologists often only see boys and young men from the perspective of missed prevention.What should an offer for boys and young men look like in a urologist's practice that focuses on the physical, social and sexual health of boys and young men? The author draws analogies for the establishment of consultation hours for young men in a urologist's practice based on her successful establishment of consultation hours for girls in a gynecologist's practice.Due to acceleration, boys also enter puberty early today. Because of their lack of knowledge about the changes in their body, they can be described as overnewsed and underinformed, despite their intense media consumption. This mixture of half-knowledge, coolness, sexual curiosity and lack of ability for predictive planning and action prevents boys and young men from having the knowledge they need to adequately and responsibly deal with their physical, social and sexual health care.If boys and young men had the opportunity to learn, appreciate, and protect their bodies at an early stage through competent preventive offers in the urologist's practice, then they would also experience less stress and powerlessness. In addition, it is almost certain that solid, fundamental understanding concerning their health will also lead to specific effects in male health competence. Only in this manner can young men be made ??aware of the preventive services in a urological practice and can be a partner in other medically necessary decision-making processes.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477879","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Reproductive health","weight":0.803461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.569226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.509404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Andrology","weight":0.496338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrology"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.436741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.371845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.317046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.28707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.165548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.125893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.113089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0650786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Analogy","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy"},{"name":"New media","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Action theory (philosophy)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_theory_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Domestic partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_partnership"},{"name":"Canada Health Act","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Health_Act"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Curiosity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0130192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"}]}
