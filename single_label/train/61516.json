{"id":61516,"title":"Host thiopurine methyltransferase status affects mercaptopurine antileukemic effectiveness in a murine model.","abstract":"Thiopurines are used for many cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients with an inherited host defect in thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) are at high risk for life-threatening toxicity if treated with conventional dosages, but the impact on antileukemic efficacy is less clear.We treated thiopurine-sensitive BCR-ABL+Arf-null Tpmt+/+ ALL in Tpmt+/+, +/-, or -/- recipient mice to test the impact of the host polymorphism on antileukemic efficacy.Median survival was similar in untreated mice of different Tpmt genotypes (16-18 days). However, in mice treated with low-dose mercaptopurine (such as tolerated by TPMT-/- patients), the difference in 30-day leukemia-free survival by Tpmt genotype was profound: 5% (±9%) for Tpmt+/+ mice, 47% (±26%) for Tpmt+/- mice, and 85% (±14%) for Tpmt-/- mice (P=5×10), indicating a substantial impact of host Tpmt status on thiopurine effectiveness. Among Tpmt+/+ recipient mice, leukemia-free survival improved with higher doses of mercaptopurine (similar to doses tolerated by wild-type patients) compared with lower doses, and at higher doses was comparable (P=0.6) to the survival of Tpmt-/- mice treated with the lower dose.These findings support the notion that germline polymorphisms in Tpmt affect not only host tissue toxicity but also antitumor effectiveness.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710003","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.807574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.726634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.660011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Mercaptopurine","weight":0.628281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercaptopurine"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.518116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.468265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Thiopurine methyltransferase","weight":0.353333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiopurine_methyltransferase"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.243012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.219913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Thiopurine","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiopurine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Methyltransferase","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyltransferase"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"1618","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1618"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}]}
