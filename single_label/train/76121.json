{"id":76121,"title":"[Effect of electroacupuncture stimulation of \"Fenglong\" (ST 40) on expression of inflammatory cytokines of celiac macrophages in hyperlipidemia rats].","abstract":"To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation of \"Fenglong\" (ST 40) on celiac inflammatory factors in rats with hyperlipemia (HLP), so as to reveal its mechanism underlying improvement of HLP.A total of 40 SD rats were randomized into normal control, high fat forage, high fat + common forage, high fat + EA, and high fat + common forage+ EA groups, with 8 rats in each group. The HLP model was established by feeding the animals with high fat forage for 28 days. EA (2 mA, 2 Hz/100 Hz) was applied to bilateral ST 40 for 30 min, once daily for 28 days. Contents of plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were detected by using an automatic biochemistry analyzer. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and interleukin-1 gamma (IL-1gamma) in macrophages of the abdominal cavity were detected using flow cytometry (FCM).Compared with the normal control group, the contents of plasma TC and LDL-C, and celiac macrophages' MCP-1, ICAM-1 and IL-1gamma contents were significantly increased in the high fat forage group and high fat + common forage group (P < 0.01). In comparison with the high fat forage group, contents of plasma TC and LDL-C, and macrophages' MCP-1, ICAM-1 and IL-1gamma were considerably down-regulated in the high fat + EA group (P < 0.01). Similarly, the levels of plasma TC and LDL-C, and macrophages' MCP-1, ICAM-1 and IL-1gamma were obviously lower in the high fat+ common forage+ EA group than in the high fat + common forage group (P < 0.01). No significant differences were found in plasma TG and HDL-C levels among the five groups (P > 0.05).EA stimulation of \"Fenglong\" (ST 40) has a role in down-regulating contents of plasma TC and LDL-C and celiac macrophages' MCP-1, ICAM-1 and IL-1gamma in the abdominal cavity in hyperlipemia rats, which may contribute to its effect in improving hyperlipemia.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
