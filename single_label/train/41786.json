{"id":41786,"title":"Modification of the hepatitis B virus envelope protein glycosylation pattern interferes with secretion of viral particles, infectivity, and susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies.","abstract":"The envelope proteins of hepatitis B virus (HBV) bear an N-linked glycosylation site at N146 within the immunodominant a-determinant in the antigenic loop (AGL) region. This glycosylation site is never fully functional, leading to a nearly 1/1 ratio of glycosylated/nonglycosylated isoforms in the viral envelope. Here we investigated the requirement for a precise positioning of N-linked glycan at amino acid 146 and the functions associated with the glycosylated and nonglycosylated isoforms. We observed that the removal of the N146 glycosylation site by mutagenesis was permissive to envelope protein synthesis and stability and to secretion of subviral particles (SVPs) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) virions, but it was detrimental to HBV virion production. Several positions in the AGL could substitute for position 146 as the glycosylation acceptor site. At position 146, neither a glycan chain nor asparagine was absolutely required for infectivity, but there was a preference for a polar residue. Envelope proteins bearing 5 AGL glycosylation sites became hyperglycosylated, leading to an increased capacity for SVP secretion at the expense of HBV and HDV virion secretion. Infectivity-compatible N-glycosylation sites could be inserted at 3 positions (positions 115, 129, and 136), but when all three positions were glycosylated, the hyperglycosylated mutant was substantially attenuated at viral entry, while it acquired resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, these findings suggest that the nonglycosylated N146 is essential for infectivity, while the glycosylated form, in addition to its importance for HBV virion secretion, is instrumental in shielding the a-determinant from neutralizing antibodies.At the surface of HBV particles, the immunodominant a-determinant is the main target of neutralizing antibodies and an essential determinant of infectivity. It contains an N-glycosylation site at position 146, which is functional on only half of the envelope proteins. Our data suggest that the coexistence of nonglycosylated and glycosylated N146 at the surface of HBV reflects the dual function of this determinant in infectivity and immune escape. Hence, a modification of the HBV glycosylation pattern affects not only virion assembly and infectivity but also immune escape.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Digestive System
