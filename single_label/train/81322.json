{"id":81322,"title":"Why use oral splints for temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)?","abstract":"Several etiologic routes have either been determined or proposed for Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD). Notable among these are myofascial, disc displacement, and arthritides disorders. The absence of concrete and universally accepted evidence-based treatment approaches means that debates as to the precise etiology and treatment of TMDs continue while practitioners attempt to treat and improve the lives of patients who present with these debilitating disorders. The use of oral splints (OS) by clinicians with responsibility to manage TMDs is quite popular, even though its mechanism of action and efficacy remains unclear. This article reviews the rationale for the continued use of OS for the management of TMDs.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163219","annotations":[{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.366152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.318934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.311024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.193871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.184698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Concrete","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Autism therapies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_therapies"},{"name":"Splint (medicine)","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splint_(medicine)"}]}
