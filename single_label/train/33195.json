{"id":33195,"title":"ST-segment elevation after direct current shock mimicking acute myocardial infarction: a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"External direct current (DC) shocks are and have long been commonly used for electrical cardioversion/defibrillation of atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. ST-segment elevation after cardio version with DC is an easily ignored phenomenon, occurring acutely and resolving during the first few minutes postshock. Here, we describe electrocardiographic findings of widespread ST-segment elevation lasting at least 1 hour after DC cardioversion for ventricular defibrillation due to Brugada syndrome and mimicking acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This case of ST-segment elevation without a dynamic and evolving AMI underscores the need to consider other causes of ST-segment elevation.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856749","annotations":[{"name":"Brugada syndrome","weight":0.898537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugada_syndrome"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.859999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Cardioversion","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioversion"},{"name":"Defibrillation","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillation"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Direct current","weight":0.667347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.641133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.579766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.348425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Electric shock","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_shock"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"}]}
