{"id":42783,"title":"Low pepsinogen I level predicts multiple gastric epithelial neoplasias for endoscopic resection.","abstract":"Synchronous/metachronous gastric epithelial neoplasias (GENs) in the remaining lesion can develop at sites other than the site of endoscopic resection. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the predictive value of serum pepsinogen for detecting multiple GENs in patients who underwent endoscopic resection.In total, 228 patients with GEN who underwent endoscopic resection and blood collection for pepsinogen I and II determination were evaluated retrospectively.The mean period of endoscopic follow-up was 748.8Â±34.7 days. Synchronous GENs developed in 46 of 228 (20.1%) and metachronous GENs in 27 of 228 (10.6%) patients during the follow-up period. Multiple GENs were associated with the presence of pepsinogen I <30 ng/mL (p<0.001). Synchronous GENs were associated with the presence of pepsinogen I <30 ng/mL (p<0.001).Low pepsinogen I levels predict multiple GENs after endoscopic resection, especially synchronous GENs. Cautious endoscopic examination prior to endoscopic resection to detect multiple GENs should be performed for these patients.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827624","annotations":[{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.779563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.616901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.602943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.543607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.235411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Pepsin","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsin"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.026362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Synchronization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization"},{"name":"834","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/834"},{"name":"228","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/228"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
