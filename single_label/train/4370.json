{"id":4370,"title":"A dot-ELISA test using a Gnathostoma spinigerum recombinant matrix metalloproteinase protein for the serodiagnosis of human gnathostomiasis.","abstract":"Gnathostomiasis caused by Gnathostoma spinigerum, is a hazardous food- borne helminthic zoonosis, and is endemic especially in developing countries in Asia. Definitive diagnosis, relying upon identification of worms from human tissues or body, is rarely accomplished. Consequently, sensitive supporting tools such as serological tests have been used widely. But these methods are time con- suming, need sophisticated equipment and are impractical in some settings. In the present study a dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA), using C. spin igerum recombinant matrix metalloproteinase protein as the antigen, was developed and assessed using sera of gnathostomiasis and other parasitosis pa- tients as well as healthy controls. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 97.4%, 100%, 96.1%, 92.9%, and 100%, respectively. The dot-ELISA appears to be a suitable rapid test for diagnostic purpose as well as epidemiological studies.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417498","annotations":[{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Parasitic worm","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.657353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.408763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.357917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Parasitic disease","weight":0.321043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_disease"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Worm","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Gnathostomiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnathostomiasis"},{"name":"Gnathostoma spinigerum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnathostoma_spinigerum"},{"name":"Gnathostoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnathostoma"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Confidence trick","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Point-of-care testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-of-care_testing"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Pa (Maori)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa_(Maori)"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"92.9 (Perth radio station)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/92.9_(Perth_radio_station)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Spin (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)"}]}
