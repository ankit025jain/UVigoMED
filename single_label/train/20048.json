{"id":20048,"title":"Impact of a mixed bacterial lysate (OM-85 BV) on the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of inactivated influenza vaccine in children with recurrent respiratory tract infection.","abstract":"It is known that the immunogenicity and efficacy of conventional inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) are not completely satisfactory in children. The aim of this prospective, randomised, single-blind study was to compare the immune response to, and the effectiveness and safety of, an IIV (Fluarix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) administered to 68 children aged 36-59 months affected by recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) who were vaccinated with (n=33) or without (n=35) the mixed bacterial lysate OM-85 BV (Broncho-vaxom, Vifor Pharma, Geneva, Switzerland). OM-85 BV had no effect on seroconversion or seroprotection rates, geometric mean titres, or dendritic cells, which were not significantly different between the two groups. Moreover, OM-85 BV did not significantly increase the pool of the memory B cells that produce IgG and IgM antibodies against the influenza antigens. However, respiratory morbidity was significantly lower in the children treated with OM-85 BV (p<0.05), thus confirming its positive effect on the incidence of RRTIs. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups. These findings show that the immune response of children to influenza vaccine is not significantly influenced by the administration of OM-85 BV. However, the use of OM-85 before and at the same time as IIV seems to reduce respiratory morbidity, and seems to be safe and well tolerated.
