{"id":44378,"title":"Randomised clinical trial: The beneficial effects of VSL#3 in obese children with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.","abstract":"Gut microbiota modifiers may have beneficial effects of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) but randomised controlled trials (RCT) are lacking in children.To perform a double-blind RCT of VSL#3 vs. placebo in obese children with biopsy-proven NAFLD.Of 48 randomised children, 44 (22 VSL#3 and 22 placebo) completed the study. The main outcome was the change in fatty liver severity at 4 months as detected by ultrasonography. Secondary outcomes were the changes in triglycerides, insulin resistance as detected by the homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA), alanine transaminase (ALT), body mass index (BMI), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and activated GLP-1 (aGLP-1). Ordinal and linear models with cluster confidence intervals were used to evaluate the efficacy of VSL#3 vs. placebo at 4 months.At baseline, moderate and severe NAFLD were present in 64% and 36% of PLA children and in 55% and 45% of VSL#3 children. The probability that children supplemented with VSL#3 had none, light, moderate or severe FL at the end of the study was 21%, 70%, 9% and 0% respectively with corresponding values of 0%, 7%, 76% and 17% for the placebo group (P < 0.001). No between-group differences were detected in triglycerides, HOMA and ALT while BMI decreased and GLP-1 and aGLP1 increased in the VSL#3 group (P < 0.001 for all comparisons).","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738701","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.904407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.866133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.714865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Steatohepatitis","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatohepatitis"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.697067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.645467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.556219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.468468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.449282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.40236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.373826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.215948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.174872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.149266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Linear model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_model"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
