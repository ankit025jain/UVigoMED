{"id":47852,"title":"Genetic polymorphisms of XRCC1 gene and susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma in Chinese population.","abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer in the worldwide. Accumulated evidences indicate that genetic polymorphisms of human X-ray repair complementing group 1 gene (XRCC1) are associated with the susceptibility to HCC. This study aims to investigate the potential association between XRCC1 c.482C>T and c.1178G>A genetic polymorphisms and the susceptibility to HCC. A total of 1,069 Chinese Han subjects consisting of 530 HCC patients and 539 cancer-free controls were recruited in this case-control study. The created restriction site-polymerase chain reaction and directly DNA sequencing methods were utilized to analyze the genotyping of XRCC1 genetic polymorphisms. Our data suggested that the XRCC1 c.482C>T and c.1178G>A genetic polymorphisms were statistically associated with the increased risks of HCC [for c.482C>T, TT vs. CC: OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.26-3.32, P = 0.003; T vs. C: OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.51, P = 0.017; for c.1178G>A, AA vs. GG: OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.26-3.67, P = 0.004; A vs. G: OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10-1.61, P = 0.004]. The allele-T and genotype-TT of c.482C>T and allele-A and genotype-AA of c.1178G>A genetic polymorphisms may enhance the susceptibility to HCC. Our findings indicate that the studied XRCC1 genetic polymorphisms may influence the risk of HCC in Chinese populations and might be used as molecular markers for assessing the risk of HCC.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570146","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.670417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.464844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"China","weight":0.332313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.314783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.271385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.254042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.153823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.128596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.120568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"XRCC1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XRCC1"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Alcoholics Anonymous","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous"},{"name":"1178","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1178"},{"name":"263","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/263"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Trinidad and Tobago","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Area code 530","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_530"},{"name":"The Strip (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strip_(The_O.C.)"}]}
