{"id":66445,"title":"Elimination and degradation of glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide in patients with end-stage renal disease.","abstract":"The affect of the kidneys in elimination and degradation of intact incretin hormones and their truncated metabolites is unclear.To evaluate elimination and degradation of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in patients with dialysis-dependent kidney failure.Twelve non-diabetic patients treated with chronic hemodialysis and 12 control subjects were examined in a double-blind, randomized, matched observational study at the Department of Nephrology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Over 4 separate study days, synthetic human GIP or GLP-1 was infused with or without concurrent inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 using sitagliptin or placebo. Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagon, and intact and total forms of GLP-1 or GIP were measured repeatedly. Plasma half-life (T1/2), metabolic clearance rate (MCR), area under curve, and volume of distribution for intact and metabolite levels of GLP-1 and GIP were calculated.Fasting concentrations of intact GLP-1 and GIP were increased in dialysis patients (P < .001) whereas fasting levels of GLP-1 and GIP metabolites did not differ between groups (P > .738). MCRs of intact GLP-1 and GIP, and the GLP-1 metabolite were reduced in dialysis patients on the placebo day (P < .009), and T1/2 of intact and metabolite forms of GLP-1 and GIP were comparable between groups (P > .121).Unexpectedly, degradation and elimination of the intact and metabolite forms of GLP-1 and GIP seemed preserved, although reduced, in patients with dialysis-dependent kidney failure.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712563","annotations":[{"name":"Glucagon","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.922575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sitagliptin","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitagliptin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Incretin","weight":0.809336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incretin"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.737921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.709644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.673924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Volume of distribution","weight":0.671581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_distribution"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.626059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.528221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.494167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.472774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Copenhagen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen"},{"name":"University of Copenhagen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Copenhagen"},{"name":"Gastric inhibitory polypeptide","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_inhibitory_polypeptide"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Distribution (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Artificial life","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life"}]}
