{"id":88483,"title":"Rare case of dual lesion: nonossifying fibroma and osteochondroma.","abstract":"In this paper, we offer radiographic and pathologic evidence of a unique coexisting dual lesion. A 14-year-old boy presented for evaluation of a painful right knee after sustaining a twisting injury. The patient was found to have a torn anterior cruciate ligament, in addition to incidental finding of distal femoral dual lesion composed of tissue consistent with a nonossifying fibroma and an osteochondroma. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the medical literature of a dual lesion containing both an osteochondroma and nonossifying fibroma.
