{"id":23881,"title":"Is there any value in measuring faecal calprotectin in Clostridium difficile positive faecal samples?","abstract":"Markers of intestinal inflammation have been proposed for inclusion in Clostridium difficile diagnostic algorithms. Faecal calprotectin (f-Cp), a sensitive marker of intestinal inflammation, was evaluated for utility in C. difficile diagnosis in the hospital setting. One hundred and twenty C. difficile positive and 99 C. difficile negative faecal samples of hospital-acquired diarrhoea were analysed for f-Cp using a quantitative ELISA. C. difficile positivity was confirmed using ELISAs for either toxins (n?=?45) or glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) with toxin gene confirmation (n?=?75). Non-parametric ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis) was used for data analysis. C. difficile positive samples had higher (P<0.05) median (interquartile range) f-Cp levels; 336 µg g(-1) (208-536) for toxin and 249 µg g(-1) (155-498) for GDH and toxin gene positive compared with 106 µg g(-1) (46-176) for C. difficile and culture-negative faecal samples. Five C. difficile positive samples were f-Cp negative (<50 µg g(-1)). A f-Cp concentration >50 µg g(-1) was 96?% sensitive and 26?% specific for C. difficile, with area under the ROC curve of 0.82. There is no role for f-CP alone in predicting C. difficile infection in hospital-acquired diarrhoea due to its low specificity.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464697","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.912788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.898499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.781244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.689984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.689003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.669144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.433045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.353725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.239537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Glutamate dehydrogenase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"249","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/249"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Non-parametric statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Gonzo (company)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzo_(company)"}]}
