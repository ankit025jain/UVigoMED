{"id":77311,"title":"[Person-organization fit as a mediator of relationship between work environment and stress among social workers].","abstract":"Occupational stress of social workers is associated with various psychosocial hazards in the work environment. Some of them affect person-organization fit (P-O fit). The aim of the study was to verify a hypothesis on the mediating role of P-O fit in the relationship between work environment and stress.The research was based on a sample of 500 social workers directly involved in social work. The data were obtained using the Person-Organization Fit Questionnaire by Czarnota-Bojarska, the Work Environment Questionnaire developed by the Department of Occupational Psychology, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, ?Ã³d?, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) by Cohen et al.As revealed by the regression analysis of the 4 analyzed work environment factors, only organizational politics was significantly related with perceived stress. Complementary and supplementary dimensions of P-O fit and identification with organization were the mediators of the relationship between organizational policies and stress, but only complementary fit proved to be a total mediator.The results of the study suggest that person-organization fit, especially its complementary aspect, is an essential determinant of accomplishing the core functions of social work and good practice among social workers.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090851","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.523435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.477647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.417948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.359055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Politics","weight":0.322557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"},{"name":"Industrial and organizational psychology","weight":0.322371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Social work","weight":0.306483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.30633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.121984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Institute of Occupational Medicine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Occupational_Medicine"},{"name":"Structuralism","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0272758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Civic Platform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Platform"},{"name":"Honda Fit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Fit"},{"name":"Supplementary angles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_angles"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"},{"name":"Best practice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice"}]}
