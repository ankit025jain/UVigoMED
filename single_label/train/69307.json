{"id":69307,"title":"Increased serum C-reactive protein level is associated with increased storage lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.","abstract":"Chronic inflammation is considered as one of the contributing mechanisms of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level is the widely used biomarker of inflammatory status. This study investigated the association between serum CRP level in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) before and after medical treatment.A total of 853 men with BPH and LUTS were enrolled. All patients completed the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) questionnaire and urological examinations. The parameters of uroflowmetry (maximum flow rate, Qmax; voided volume, VV), post-void residual (PVR), total prostate volume (TPV) and transition zone index (TZI), serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), and serum CRP levels were obtained. All patients were treated with alpha-blocker or antimuscarinic agent based on the IPSS voiding to storage subscore ratio (IPSS-V/S). Correlation analyses were performed between serum CRP levels with age, IPSS, TPV, TZI, Qmax, PVR, VV, PSA and between baseline and post treatment.The mean age was 66.9 ± 11.6 years old and the mean serum CRP levels were 0.31 ± 0.43 mg/dL. Univariate analyses revealed serum CRP levels were significantly associated with age (p<0.001), PSA levels (p = 0.005) and VV (p = 0.017), but not significantly associated with TPV (p = 0.854) or PVR (p = 0.068). CRP levels were positively associated with urgency (p<0.001) and nocturia (p<0.001) subscore of IPSS, total IPSS (p = 0.008) and storage IPSS (p<0.001) and negatively associated with IPSS- V/S ratio (p = 0.014). Multivariate analyses revealed that serum CRP levels were significantly associated with age (p = 0.004) and storage IPSS subscore p<0.001). Patients with IPSS-V/S<1 and treated with tolterodine for 3 months had significant decrease of CRP levels after treatment.Serum CRP levels are associated with storage LUTS and sensory bladder disorders, suggesting chronic inflammation might play a role in the patients with storage predominant LUTS.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24454896","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Muscarinic antagonist","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_antagonist"},{"name":"Tolterodine","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolterodine"},{"name":"Nocturia","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturia"},{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.569493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.522422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.52066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.250837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Transitioning (transgender)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitioning_(transgender)"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
