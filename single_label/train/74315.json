{"id":74315,"title":"Subharmonic aided pressure estimation for monitoring interstitial fluid pressure in tumours--in vitro and in vivo proof of concept.","abstract":"The feasibility of using subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) to noninvasively estimate interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) was studied. In vitro, radiofrequency signals, from 0.2 ml/l of Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging, N Billerica, MA) were acquired within a water-tank with a Sonix RP ultrasound scanner (Analogic Ultrasound, Richmond, BC, Canada; fT/R=6.7/3.35 MHz and fT/R=10/5 MHz) and the subharmonic amplitudes of the signals were compared over 0-50 mmHg. In vivo, five swine with naturally occurring melanomas were studied. Subharmonic signals were acquired from tumours and surrounding tissue during infusion of Definity and compared to needle-based pressure measurements. Both in vitro and in vivo, an inverse linear relationship between hydrostatic pressure and subharmonic amplitude was observed with r(2)=0.63-0.95; p<0.05, maximum amplitude drop 11.36 dB at 10 MHz and -8 dB, and r(2) as high as 0.97; p<0.02 (10 MHz and -4/-8 dB most promising), respectively, indicating that SHAPE may be useful in monitoring IFP.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856899","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.824076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.756417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.491778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.478086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.411798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.41176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.391098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.316177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.255638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Billerica, Massachusetts","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billerica,_Massachusetts"},{"name":"Richmond, British Columbia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_British_Columbia"},{"name":"Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Powers_Europe"},{"name":"Proof of concept","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept"},{"name":"Subharmonic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subharmonic"},{"name":"Avaya Definity","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaya_Definity"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Hydrostatic pressure","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_pressure"},{"name":"Nanosecond","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosecond"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Multiplicative inverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Fluid statics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_statics"},{"name":"Massachusetts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts"},{"name":"Water tank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_tank"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Probability amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude"},{"name":"Analogic Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogic_Corporation"}]}
