{"id":79467,"title":"[Relationship between immune response and secretory otitis media].","abstract":"Otitis media with effusion (OME) was first described by Austrian otologist POLITZERZAI in 1867. The main feature is ear effusion and conductive hearing loss. However the etiology and pathogenesis of OME has not been clear up to now. It is thought that OME can be induced by upper respiratory infection,also can arise after radiotherapy of head and neck cancer. Presently the dysfunction of eustachian tube,infection of middle ear and allergic reaction are considered to be the major causes of OME. In recent years, more and more researches have concerned in immune response and otitis media with effusion.","date":"2014-01-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417174","annotations":[{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.797668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Upper respiratory tract infection","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.701566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.671254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.510982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.492058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.404853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.366709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Otology","weight":0.29774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otology"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Conductive hearing loss","weight":0.183226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductive_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Austria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Alpha taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_taxonomy"}]}
