{"id":17356,"title":"Homologous prime boosting based on intranasal delivery of non-pathogenic invasive Escherichia coli expressing MPT64, decreases Mycobacterium tuberculosis dissemination.","abstract":"Protein-subunit vaccines as boosting strategies against tuberculosis (TB) infection are currently in the pipeline of TB vaccine research. Their main limitation is represented by their poor immunogenicity, which makes it necessary to couple protein-subunits with adjuvant molecules. In this study, we employed replication-deficient invasive Escherichia coli strains to deliver Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins to the cytoplasm of non-phagocytic eukaryotic cells using various priming and prime-boosting vaccination protocols. Our results demonstrate that intranasal administration of invasive E. coli expressing the M. tuberculosis protective antigen MPT64 to mice primed with a recombinant BCG strain over-expressing MPT64 on its surface, decrease bacterial burden in mice spleens. Our data suggest that replication-deficient invasive E. coli may represent a suitable platform for BCG/rBCG priming followed by homologous-boosting immunization strategies.
