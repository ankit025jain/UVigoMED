{"id":79646,"title":"Ectopic cutaneous schistosomiasis - case report.","abstract":"Schistosomiasis is best known in its visceral form but it can attack the skin, its ectopic cutaneous manifestation being rare and clinically difficult to diagnose. It is characterized by isolated or coalescent papules, erythematous, pruritic or asymptomatic, with zosteriform distribution, often located on the trunk. The authors report a case of a 28-year-old female patient with lesions on the abdomen, with positive stool results for Schistosoma and absence of active symptoms of visceral disease. The case reveals rare exuberant cutaneous manifestation and the importance of the diagnosis of this entity in patients from endemic regions.
