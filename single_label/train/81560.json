{"id":81560,"title":"Overjet, overbite, and anterior crowding relapses in extraction and nonextraction patients, and their correlations.","abstract":"In this study, we aimed to compare the relapse of maxillary and mandibular anterior crowding, overjet, and overbite 5 years after treatment in subjects with Class I and Class II malocclusions treated with and without extractions, and also to evaluate the correlations among these factors.The sample comprised 84 subjects with Class I and Class II malocclusions, treated with and without extractions. Group 1 comprised 44 subjects with an initial mean age of 12.96 years treated without extractions. Group 2 included 40 subjects with an initial mean age of 13.01 years treated with 4 premolar extractions. Data were obtained from dental casts at the pretreatment, posttreatment, and long-term posttreatment stages. Intergroup comparisons were performed with t tests. To verify the correlations among the relapse of overjet, overbite, and anterior crowding, the Pearson correlation test was used.Maxillary incisor irregularity and its relapse in the nonextraction group were significantly greater at the long-term posttreatment stage and the long-term posttreatment period, respectively. Long-term postreatment overjet changes were similar in the groups. Overbite and its relapse were significantly greater in the extraction group in the long-term posttreatment stage and period, respectively. There was a positive correlation of the relapse of mandibular incisor crowding with the relapse of overjet and overbite, and also a correlation of overjet and overbite relapses.There was greater maxillary crowding relapse in the nonextraction group and greater overbite relapse in the extraction group. There were significant and positive correlations of overjet and overbite relapses with mandibular anterior crowding relapse and consequently between overjet and overbite relapses.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975000","annotations":[{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.910198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.813874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.810198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Maxillary sinus","weight":0.53429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_sinus"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.497193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.37219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.260294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0960096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Overbite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overbite"},{"name":"Stage (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Data (Star Trek)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Irregularity of a surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregularity_of_a_surface"},{"name":"Intergroups in the European Parliament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergroups_in_the_European_Parliament"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
