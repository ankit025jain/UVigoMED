{"id":20781,"title":"Improving quality of tuberculosis care in India.","abstract":"In India, the quality of care that tuberculosis (TB) patients receive varies considerably and is often not in accordance with the national and international standards. In this article, we provide an overview of the third (latest) edition of the International Standards of Tuberculosis Care (ISTC). These standards are supported by the existing World Health Organization guidelines and policy statements pertaining to TB care and have been endorsed by a number of international organizations. We call upon all health care providers in the country to practice TB care that is consistent with these standards, as well as the upcoming Standards for TB Care in India (STCI).","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640340","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.728398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.415465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"International organization","weight":0.392673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.10409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"International standard","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0202786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Incunabula Short Title Catalogue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incunabula_Short_Title_Catalogue"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
