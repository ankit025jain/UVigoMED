{"id":69061,"title":"The effect of different doses of chloroprocaine on saddle anesthesia in perianal surgery.","abstract":"To investigate a saddle anesthesia with different doses of chloroprocaine in perianal surgery.Total 60 Patients aged 18-75 years (Anesthesiologists grade I or II) scheduled to receive perianal surgery. Patients using saddle anesthesia were randomized to group A, group B and group C with the same concentration (0.5%) chloroprocaine with different doses 1.0 mL, 0.8 mL and 0.6 mL, respectively. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR) and the sensory and motor block were recorded to evaluate the anesthesia effect of chloroprocaine in each group.The duration of sensory block of group C is shorter than those of group A and B. The maximum degree of motor block is observed (group C: 0 level, group A: III level; and group B: I level) after 15 minutes. Besides, there was a better anesthetic effect in group B than group A and group C, such as walking after saddle anesthesia. However, there is also no significant difference of blood pressure decreasing in these three groups.It's worth to employ a saddle anesthesia with appropriate doses of chloroprocaine in clinical perianal surgery.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474180","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.682766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.626425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.602327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.470048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.352588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0495871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Chloroprocaine","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroprocaine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"1875","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1875"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Electric motor","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Schlaich Bergermann & Partner","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlaich_Bergermann_&_Partner"},{"name":"Saddle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
