{"id":56533,"title":"Severe bilateral paralimbal sterile infiltrates after photorefractive keratectomy.","abstract":"This study presents a case report of the clinical presentation and management of a 47-year-old male myope who underwent photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and developed bilateral sterile corneal infiltrates at 1 day post-operatively. The patient was successfully treated with aggressive topical antibiotic and topical steroid therapy. The final corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was 20/25 with faint corneal scarring. Peripheral sterile corneal infiltrate can occur after PRK with excellent prognosis. Infectious causes should be suspected in all cases of corneal infiltrate. The most likely cause of peripheral sterile corneal infiltrate in this case was pooling of the tear film containing antigens under the bandage contact lens.
