{"id":68293,"title":"Germline genetic variants associated with prostate cancer and potential relevance to clinical practice.","abstract":"The inherited link of prostate cancer predisposition has been supported using data from early epidemiological studies, as well as from familial and twin studies. Early linkage analyses and candidate gene approaches to identify these variants yielded mixed results. Since then, multiple genetic variants associated with prostate cancer susceptibility have now been found from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Their clinical utility, however, remains unknown. It is recognised that collaborative efforts are needed to ensure adequate sample sizes are available to definitively investigate the genetic-clinical interactions. These could have important implications for public health as well as individualised prostate cancer management strategies. With the costs of genotyping decreasing and direct-to-consumer testing already offered for these common variants, it is envisaged that a lot of attention will be focussed in this area. These results will enable more refined risk stratification which will be important for targeting screening and prevention to higher risk groups. Ascertaining their clinical role remains an important goal for the GWAS community with international consortia now established, pooling efforts and resources to move this field forward.
