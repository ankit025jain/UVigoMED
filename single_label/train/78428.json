{"id":78428,"title":"[Clinical analysis of 337 cases of chronic rhinosinusitis].","abstract":"To explore the clinical symptoms and signs situation of chronic rhinosinusitis, for future treatment provides the basis.The clinical data of 337 patients with chronic sinusitis were analyzed, using SPSS 18.0 software and conducted Person chi-square test and Kruskal-Wallis test to analysis.VAS total score of chronic nasal sinusitis patients is 15.9 +/- 5.7. The three top of severe symptoms were: stuffy nose 56 cases (16.6%), nasal secretions or postnasal drip 23 cases (6.8%) and dizziness or headache 11 cases (3.3%), there are statistically significant differences (chi2 = 430.923, P < 0.01). Lund-Kennedy score found side with mucosa edema and secretion serious degree higher than nasal polyp, there are statistically significant difference (chi2 = 128.684, P < 0.01). Lund-Mackay score showed that the three top parts of all shadow were: maxillary sinus 314 side (46.6%), OMC 135 side (20.0%) and the former screen 112 side (16.6%), there are statistically significant differences between groups (chi2 = 803.274, P < 0.01). The pearson correlation coefficient r between VAS score and Lund-Kennedy score is 0.516, there are correlation (P < 0.05). VAS score and Lund-Mackay (r = 0.213), there are not correlation (P > 0.05).Comprehensive treatment should be proceeded according to different symptom severity and sinus lesions parts with patients, grasped the surgery procedures strictly, so as to improve the cure rate.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
