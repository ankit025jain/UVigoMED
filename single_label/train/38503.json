{"id":38503,"title":"[Feasibility and results of at-home follow-up after early postpartum discharge from maternity units in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso].","abstract":"to describe the feasibility and results of at-home follow-up of mothers and newborns discharged early from the maternity ward after normal childbirth.This prospective descriptive study took place during a one month period (April 1-30, 2011) in five maternity units in Bobo-Dioulasso, the second largest city in Burkina Faso. Mothers with normal vaginal deliveries and no complications at the sixth hour postpartum were included in the study with their newborns after informed oral consent. The discharge took place between 12 and 48 hours after delivery. The follow-up took place by telephone, home visits, and emergency hospital visits in cases of complications. A postnatal hospital visit was systematically planned for day 7.The study included 630 mothers and their babies. There were 1567 phone calls made: 27 women could not be reached by telephone after discharge, and 140 home visits took place, either at the mother's request or because of the failure to reach her by telephone. Complications were observed in 55 mothers and 135 babies.Postnatal follow-up at home is required for mothers and their newborns discharged early from the maternity ward after normal childbirth in view of the possibility of complications. This ensures continuity of care to improve survival of mothers and babies. As cell phones become more and more available, they may play an important role as a tool for such follow up.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418900","annotations":[{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.407755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.244135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Burkina Faso","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.128219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.126224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Maternity","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity"},{"name":"Continuity (fiction)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_(fiction)"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"1567","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1567"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Requirements management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_management"},{"name":"Sext","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sext"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Ward (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(law)"},{"name":"Continuity of Care Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_Care_Document"}]}
