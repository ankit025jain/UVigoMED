{"id":87496,"title":"[Surgical treatment of ischial apophysis avulsion. Case report].","abstract":"The optimal management of ischial apophysis avulsion, especially indications for surgery, is not well defined. The authors present the case of a 16-year-old man who sustained an avulsion fracture of the ischial apophysis during his athlete training programme. The avulsion was diagnosed by X-ray. Because of displacement, surgery was indicated and open reduction with osteosynthesis was performed using a subgluteal approach on the eighth day after injury. Full weight bearing was allowed at nine weeks after injury, after the post-operative rehabilitation programme had been completed. Return to his sports activity was allowed at four months after injury. At one post-operative year the patient was free of any symptoms. The proper surgical treatment of a displaced ischial apophysis avulsion and subsequent rehabilitation allow for early full weight bearing, including sports activities. The subgluteal approach provides good access to the ischial tuberosity with a minimal risk of complications and a good cosmetic outcome. Key words:apophysis, ischial tuberosity, avulsion.
