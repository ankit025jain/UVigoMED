{"id":88547,"title":"Higher 25(OH)D2 is associated with lower 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3.","abstract":"Despite common use of supplemental vitamin D2 in clinical practice, the associations of serum vitamin D2 concentrations with other vitamin D metabolites and total vitamin D are unclear.The aim of the study was to measure vitamin D2 and D3 levels and examine their associations with each other and with total vitamin D.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 679 randomly selected participants from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D2 [25(OH)D2], 25(OH)D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 [1,25(OH)2D2], and 1,25(OH)2D3 were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and were summed to obtain total 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D. Associations between all metabolites (D2, D3, and total levels) were examined using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Spearman correlations.25(OH)D2 and 1,25(OH)2D2 were detectable in 189 (27.8%) and 178 (26.2%) of the men, respectively. Higher 25(OH)D2 levels did not correlate with higher total 25(OH)D (r = 0.10; P = .17), although median total 25(OH)D was slightly higher in those with detectable vs undetectable 25(OH)D2 (25.8 vs 24.3 ng/mL; P < .001). 25(OH)D2 was not positively associated with total 1,25(OH)2D levels (r = -0.11; P = .13), and median 1,25(OH)2D level was not higher in those with detectable vs undetectable 25(OH)D2. Higher 25(OH)D2 was associated with lower 25(OH)D3 (r = -0.35; P < .001) and 1,25(OH)2D3 (r = -0.32; P < .001), with median levels of both D3 metabolites 18-35% higher when D2 metabolites were undetectable.In a cohort of older men, 25(OH)D2 is associated with lower levels of 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3, suggesting that vitamin D2 may decrease the availability of D3 and may not increase calcitriol levels.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828488","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.738571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.460158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.447954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.376722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.308895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.243062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.227058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.16565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Hydroxide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"1835","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1835"},{"name":"189","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/189"},{"name":"679","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/679"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Match play","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_play"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Dopamine receptor D2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor_D2"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Spearman, Texas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman,_Texas"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
