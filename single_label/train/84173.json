{"id":84173,"title":"[Playful intervention with chronically-ill children: promoting coping].","abstract":"Chronic diseases can adversely affect the development process of children. This qualitative, action-research study had the aim to analyze the effects of activities in the manual \"Como H6spede no Hospital\" (As a patient in the hospital) on the coping process of children with chronic diseases. Study participants included six children and adolescents aged seven to 13 years, who suffered from a chronic disease. Data were collected in the pediatric clinic of a public hospital in the Brazilian state of Para√≠ba, through participant observation and individual sessions with activities from the manual. Data interpretation followed the principles of thematic analysis. The activities from the manual encouraged participants' search for information about their disease and treatment, and increased their interest and participation in their health care process, thereby contributing to better coping. The study points to the need for comprehensive care for children with chronic diseases.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25158466","annotations":[{"name":"Patient","weight":0.806209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.720727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.464734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"States of Brazil","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Brazil"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.210637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Public hospital","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_hospital"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Participant observation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participant_observation"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Real estate development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_development"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Health intervention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_intervention"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Como","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Como"}]}
