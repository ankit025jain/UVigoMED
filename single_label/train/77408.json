{"id":77408,"title":"[Treatment of psychosomatic disorders occurring in the vocational context - concept and first findings ].","abstract":"Psychosomatic symptoms often present within the vocational context. The unmet need for easily accessible and early interventions led to the development of a variety of offers in this area. From a scientific point of view, the question of how such a \"psychosomatic consultation in the workplace\" (PCIW) is best conceptualized remains open.We analysed treatment documentation for all patients of two recently established PCIW from January 2011 to January 2012 both descriptively and by qualitative content analysis.A total of 67 patients were seen, 75% of whom were male. For 75% of users PCIW constituted the first contact with psychosomatic-psychotherapeutic-psychiatric services. For about 80%of the patients a work-related aetiology could be considered. 40%of patients were recommended to outpatient psychotherapeutic care.PCIW represents an easily accessible therapeutic offer in the vocational context. There often is a mix of work-related and personal problems that suggests the cooperation of occupational and psychosomatic physicians.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24877574","annotations":[{"name":"Physician","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.603919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Psychosomatic medicine","weight":0.384485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic_medicine"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Content analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_analysis"},{"name":"Vocational education","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"Perspective (cognitive)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Battle of the Denmark Strait","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Denmark_Strait"},{"name":"First contact (science fiction)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_contact_(science_fiction)"}]}
