{"id":68364,"title":"Molecular biomarkers in advanced renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"The availability of agents directly targeting tumorigenic and angiogenic pathways has significantly improved the outcomes of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in recent years. However, all patients eventually become resistant and a substantial percentage experience immediate disease progression with first-line targeted therapy. In addition, patients have variable clinical benefit and/or tolerance to different agents, including drugs within the same class. Thus, the choice of therapy for an individual patient remains empiric at present. Upon this landscape, several molecular biomarkers have been investigated with the purpose of guiding therapy. This review discusses prognostic biomarkers correlating with the outcome of patients independent of therapy, and predictive biomarkers of treatment response, including circulating biomarkers (such as VEGF and VEGF-related proteins, cytokine and angiogenic factors, and lactate dehydrogenase), and tissue-based biomarkers (such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms). Many potential prognostic and predictive molecular biomarkers have now been identified in RCC, although none has yet entered into clinical practice, and all require prospective validation in appropriately designed randomized studies. In the near future, however, validated biomarkers may become integral to management strategies in RCC, enabling tailored treatment for individual patients to improve clinical outcomes.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526734","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.742332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.685678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.679314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.565246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.330124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.161245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Empiricism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
