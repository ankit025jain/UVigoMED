{"id":90775,"title":"[Peace-time gunshot maxillofacial injury in Arkhangelsk region].","abstract":"We analyzed civilian gunshot wounds of maxillofacial area in 87 patients living in the Arkhangelsk region. It is noted that gunshot injuries most often occur as a result of the attempted suicide (45 cases (51,7%)), firearm associated crimes (33 cases (37,9%)) and careless handling with the weapon (9 cases (10,4%)). The most common wound canal features are described. In the majority of cases tangential gunshot wounds were seen (55 cases (63,2%)), penetrating wounds (19 cases (21,8%)) and perforating wounds (13 cases (15)). During the last years increased the number of gunshot injures by traumatic weapons (11 (12.6%)). It is recommended to take into consideration the direction and topography of the wound canals during the debridement.
