{"id":52535,"title":"Insulin-like growth factor-II: its role in metabolic and endocrine disease.","abstract":"Insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) is a widely expressed 7Â·5 kDa mitogenic peptide hormone. Although it is abundant in serum, understanding of its physiological role is limited compared with that of IGF-I. IGF-II regulates foetal development and differentiation, but its role in adults is less well understood. Evidence suggests roles in a number of tissues including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, bone and ovary. Altered IGF-II expression has been observed in metabolic conditions, notably obesity, diabetes and the polycystic ovary syndrome. This article summarizes what is known about the actions of IGF-II and its dysregulation in metabolic and endocrine diseases. The possible causes and consequences of dysregulation are discussed along with the implications for diagnostic tests and future research.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24593700","annotations":[{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.892155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.846453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Peptide hormone","weight":0.751453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_hormone"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Mitogen","weight":0.586484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.47851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Endocrine disease","weight":0.25435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_disease"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.218346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"}]}
