{"id":92768,"title":"PPAR? and RXR ligands disrupt the inflammatory cross-talk in the hypoxic breast cancer stem cells niche.","abstract":"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are affected by the local micro-environment, the niche, in which inflammatory stimuli and hypoxia act as steering factors. Here, two nuclear receptors (NRs) agonists, i.e. pioglitazone (PGZ), a ligand of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-?, and 6-OH-11-O-hydroxyphenanthrene (IIF), a ligand of retinoid X receptors, were investigated for their capability to interference with the cross-talk between breast CSCs and the niche compartment. We found that IIF potentiates the ability of PGZ to hamper the mammospheres-forming capability of human breast tumours and MCF7 cancer cells, reducing the expression of CSCs regulatory genes (Notch3, Jagged1, SLUG, Interleukin-6, Apolipoprotein E, Hypoxia inducible factor-1? and Carbonic anhydrase IX). Notably, these effects are not observed in normal-MS obtained from human breast tissue. Importantly, NRs agonists abolish the capability of hypoxic MCF7 derived exosomes to induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype in mammary glands fibroblasts. Moreover, NRs agonist also directly acts on breast tumour associated fibroblasts to downregulate nuclear factor-?B pathway and metalloproteinases (MMP2 and MMP9) expression and activity. In conclusion, NRs agonists disrupt the inflammatory cross-talk of the hypoxic breast CSCs niche.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue
