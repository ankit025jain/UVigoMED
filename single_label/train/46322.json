{"id":46322,"title":"Peginterferon and ribavirin for treatment of recurrent hepatitis C disease in HCV-HIV coinfected liver transplant recipients.","abstract":"Achievement of a sustained virologic response (SVR) with antiviral therapy significantly improves graft survival in hepatitis C virus (HCV) monoinfected liver transplant (LT) patients. Risks and benefits of HCV therapy in HCV-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfected LT recipients are not well established. Among 89 HCV-HIV LT recipients in the HIVTR cohort, 39 (23% Black, 79% genotype 1, 83% fibrosis stage ? 1) were treated with peginterferon-a2a or a2b plus ribavirin for a median 363 days (14-1373). On intent-to-treat basis, 22% (95% CI: 10-39) and 14% (95% CI: 5-30) achieved an end-of-treatment response (EOTR) and SVR, respectively. By per-protocol analysis (completed 48 weeks of therapy Â± dose reductions), 42% and 26% had EOTR and SVR, respectively. Severe adverse events occurred in 85%, with 26% hospitalized with infections and 13% developing acute rejection. Early discontinuations and dose reductions occurred in 38% and 82%, respectively, despite use of growth factors in 85%. Eighteen of 39 treated patients (46%) subsequently died/had graft loss, with 10 (26%) attributed to recurrent HCV. In conclusion, SVR rates are low and tolerability is poor in HCV-HIV coinfected transplant recipients treated with peginterferon and ribavirin. These results highlight the critical need for better tolerated and more efficacious HCV therapies for HCV-HIV coinfected transplant recipients.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636466","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.748916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.651187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.551285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
