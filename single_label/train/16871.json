{"id":16871,"title":"[Bacterial meningitis in children: epidemiological data and outcome].","abstract":"The bacterial meningitis in children remains a worrisome affection both by its frequency and by its gravity.describe the epidemiological, clinical and evolutionary data of bacterial meningitis in children aged between 3 months and 15 years.we conducted a retrospective study of all cases of bacterial meningitis collected in the department of pediatrics of Hedi Chaker hospital, during a period of 6 years (2006-2011). We analyzed the files retrospectively and we studied the epidemiological data and the outcome.Thirty cases of bacterial meningitis were recorded. The most frequent species were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae followed by Neisseria meningitidis with respectively 43%, 40%, and 6% of cases. The yearly distribution of these bacteria showed an increase of the rate of the bacterial meningitis during the last 2 years. The average age of our patients was 1 year 6months (3 months-13 years). All the patients were vaccinated according to the Tunisian vaccination calendar; and none of them had pneumococcal vaccine or the Hib vaccine. The main clinical manifestations were fever (100 %), seizures (14 %) and vomiting (44 %). Bulging fontanel was noted in 15cas (55 %), somnolence in 11 cases (40 %) and axial hypotonia in 12 cases (44 %). In the outcome, the neurological sequelae were showed in eight patients (26%).In our study, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were the main microorganisms responsible for bacterial meningitis. We strongly recommend the introduction pneumococcal vaccine in our vaccination calendar.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24938236","annotations":[{"name":"Somnolence","weight":0.922164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence"},{"name":"Haemophilus influenzae","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae"},{"name":"Neisseria meningitidis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria_meningitidis"},{"name":"Fontanelle","weight":0.884338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontanelle"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.872094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Hib vaccine","weight":0.821933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hib_vaccine"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.738291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.719463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Pneumococcal vaccine","weight":0.617019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_vaccine"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Bacterial meningitis","weight":0.488001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_meningitis"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Neisseria","weight":0.429685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.411358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.294293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Haemophilus","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus"},{"name":"Hypotonia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotonia"},{"name":"Gravitation","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation"},{"name":"Calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
