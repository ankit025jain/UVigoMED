{"id":52281,"title":"MicroRNA-23b is an independent prognostic marker and suppresses ovarian cancer progression by targeting runt-related transcription factor-2.","abstract":"Our previous study found that runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX2) was upregulated in human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tissues and may be involved in tumor progression and prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which RUNX2 is aberrantly expressed in EOC. We firstly confirmed that miRNA-23b directly targets RUNX2 in EOC. Then, ectopic expression of miR-23b significantly inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenicity by regulating the expression of RUNX2. Furthermore, the down-regulation of miR-23b was significantly correlated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis of patients with EOC. Collectively, miR-23b may function as tumor suppressor through inhibiting the upregulation of RUNX2, and may be a potential prognostic marker for EOC.
