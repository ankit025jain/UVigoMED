{"id":74154,"title":"Immunization method for multi-pass membrane proteins using highly metastatic cell lines.","abstract":"A novel method using metastatic breast cancer cell lines was established for producing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against multi-span membrane proteins. Grafting of metastatic cells (MCF7-14) into the mammary gland of BALB/cJ/nu/nu mice induced splenic hypertrophy (1.6-3.0×10(8)cells/spleen [n=6]). More than half of the mAbs against MCF7-14 cells reacted with the cell membrane. Inducing production of antibodies against the extracellular domain of multi-pass membrane proteins is difficult. Because the protein structure becomes more complex as the number of transmembrane domains increases, preparing antigens for immunization in which the original structure is maintained is challenging. Using highly metastatic MDA-MB231 cells as the host cell line, we produced mAbs against a 12 transmembrane protein, solute carrier family 6 member 6 (SLC6A6), as a model antigen. When SLC6A6-overexpressing MDA-MB231 cells were grafted into nude mice, the number of splenocytes increased to 2.7-11.4×10(8)cells/spleen (n=10). Seven mAb-producing clones that not only recognized the extracellular domain of SLC6A6 but also were of the IgG subclass were obtained. Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry analyses revealed that these mAbs recognized the native form of the extracellular domain of SLC6A6 on the cell surface. Our novel immunization method involving highly metastatic cells could be used to develop therapeutic mAbs against other multi-pass membrane proteins.
