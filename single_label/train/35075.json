{"id":35075,"title":"[Magnetic resonance imaging of premature infants with punctate white matter damage and short-term neurodevelopmental outcome].","abstract":"To investigate the early diagnosis with MRI changes, MRI types and short-term neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants with punctate white matter damage (PWMD).There were 44 preterm infants with PWMD (group A) from March 2009 to August 2010 at the neonatal ward of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, according to the number, shape and distribution of the lesions, group A was divided into dot injury group (A1), clusters group (A2) and linear group (A3), the first MRI and DWI scan of all cases were within 14 days after birth, and 17 subjects received re-examination with the MRI in the hospital. Twenty preterm infants with normal MRI (group B) received the follow-up, according to the age, 20 normal full-term infants were selected (group C) as the control group using paired design. Mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) were determined using Bayley scales of infant development-II.First MRI scan:in 44 infants with PWMD, group A1, A2, A3 separately had, 10, and 9 infants. MRI follow up in 17 cases showed that in 4 cases of A1 group the dot lesions disappeared; in 3 of 4 cases in clusters group who received re-examination, the lesions disappeared, 1 case had periventricular leukomalacia (PVL); in 5 of the 9 cases who had re-examination in linear group the lesions disappeared, while in 4 cases the lesions evolved into PVL. MDI and PDI: Group A [MDI (102.9 ± 15.5) , PDI (107.7 ± 17.5) ] was lower than that of group B[MDI (114.0 ± 13.1) , PDI (120.8 ± 9.4) ], group C [MDI (114.2 ± 12.2) , PDI (119.5 ± 10.7) ] (P < 0.05) . There were no significant differences between group B and group C. Group A1 [MDI (112.2 ± 8.1) , PDI (116.4 ± 8.5) ] had no significant differences compared with group B and group C. Group A2 [MDI (100.8 ± 12.5) , PDI (105.0 ± 12.1) ] showed significantly reduced values compared with group B, Group C, Group A1 (P < 0.05) ,Group A3 [MDI (75.8 ± 11.6) , PDI (79.1 ± 16.2) ] had lower values than group B, Group C, Group A1, and Group A2 (P < 0.05) .Premature infants with PWMD mainly showed dot-like and clustered injury that are easy to be absorbed and disappear, but the linear lesions are likely to evolve into PVL. In addition, the cluster-like and linear injury have an influence on short-term cognition and motion development, especially the outcome of linear injury was the worst.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
