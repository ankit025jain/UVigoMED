{"id":45010,"title":"Multi-TGDR, a multi-class regularization method, identifies the metabolic profiles of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus.","abstract":"Over the last decade, metabolomics has evolved into a mainstream enterprise utilized by many laboratories globally. Like other \"omics\" data, metabolomics data has the characteristics of a smaller sample size compared to the number of features evaluated. Thus the selection of an optimal subset of features with a supervised classifier is imperative. We extended an existing feature selection algorithm, threshold gradient descent regularization (TGDR), to handle multi-class classification of \"omics\" data, and proposed two such extensions referred to as multi-TGDR. Both multi-TGDR frameworks were used to analyze a metabolomics dataset that compares the metabolic profiles of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) infected with hepatitis B (HBV) or C virus (HCV) with that of cirrhosis induced by HBV/HCV infection; the goal was to improve early-stage diagnosis of HCC.We applied two multi-TGDR frameworks to the HCC metabolomics data that determined TGDR thresholds either globally across classes, or locally for each class. Multi-TGDR global model selected 45 metabolites with a 0% misclassification rate (the error rate on the training data) and had a 3.82% 5-fold cross-validation (CV-5) predictive error rate. Multi-TGDR local selected 48 metabolites with a 0% misclassification rate and a 5.34% CV-5 error rate.One important advantage of multi-TGDR local is that it allows inference for determining which feature is related specifically to the class/classes. Thus, we recommend multi-TGDR local be used because it has similar predictive performance and requires the same computing time as multi-TGDR global, but may provide class-specific inference.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707821","annotations":[{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.61914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.484489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.469054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Feature selection","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.380063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.380063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Supervised learning","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning"},{"name":"Multiclass classification","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiclass_classification"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.318273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.314057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.2165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inference","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.20487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Training set","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_set"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Predictive inference","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_inference"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Statistical classification","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Gradient descent","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent"},{"name":"Tikhonov regularization","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"}]}
