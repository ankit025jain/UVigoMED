{"id":53584,"title":"Longitudinal myocardial strain alteration is associated with left ventricular remodeling in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"In normal subjects, left ventricular (LV) dimensions have been shown to decrease over time, while wall thickness is increasing. The aim of this study was to investigate LV remodeling in a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during a 3-year follow-up period and its potential association with decreased longitudinal systolic strain (?L).One hundred seventy-two patients with type 2 diabetes without overt heart disease were prospectively enrolled and underwent echocardiography with speckle-tracking imaging to assess global LV ?L at baseline and at 3 years. The associations between alteration in ?L (defined as |?L| < 18%), LV geometry at baseline, and LV remodeling over time were evaluated.Among the 172 enrolled patients, 154 completed 3-year follow-up. At baseline, patients with ?L alteration had higher LV end-systolic volumes (28 ± 11 vs 23 ± 9 mL, P < .001) and relative wall thicknesses (RWT; 0.44 ± 0.06 vs 0.40 ± 0.07, P = .008) compared with those with normal ?L. At 3-year follow-up, RWTs remained stable in both groups. LV volumes significantly decreased in patients with normal ?L but not in patients with ?L alteration. Multivariate analysis showed that ?L alteration was independently associated with LV end-systolic volume (? = 5.0, P = .006) and RWT (? = 0.03, P = .03) at baseline and with changes in both LV end-diastolic volume (? = 19.1, P = .001) and LV end-systolic volume (? = 2.6, P = .047) over 3 years.In patients with type 2 diabetes, ?L alteration was associated with higher RWT and LV volumes and with the absence of decreases in LV volumes over time, which might be an early sign of adverse LV remodeling.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508363","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.795575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.794355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.760642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.663118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.497909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.159466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"Ventricular remodeling","weight":0.138374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_remodeling"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0721644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0554503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Latvia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Altered chord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Uncial 047","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_047"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
