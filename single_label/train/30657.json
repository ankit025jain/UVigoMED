{"id":30657,"title":"[Drug-associated hyperthermic syndromes].","abstract":"Drug-associated hyperthermic syndromes include the serotonin syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, neuroleptic-induced catatonia, anticholinergic syndrome, sympatomimetic syndrome and malignant hyperthermia. Discontinuation of medication is a sufficient treatment for mild serotonin syndrome. In a more severe situation the patient's spasticity and hyperthermia are treated with drugs. In neuroleptic malignant syndrome discontinuation of medication does not suffice, but the patient needs active therapy. Many of the drugs causing these syndromes are common in clinical use. Starting an effective treatment early enough is more important than a precise diagnosis.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471206","annotations":[{"name":"Serotonin syndrome","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome"},{"name":"Anticholinergic","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticholinergic"},{"name":"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroleptic_malignant_syndrome"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Catatonia","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catatonia"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antipsychotic","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.734292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.518451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Spasticity","weight":0.295556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasticity"},{"name":"Malignant hyperthermia","weight":0.0636559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_hyperthermia"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"}]}
