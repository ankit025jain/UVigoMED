{"id":24039,"title":"Future options for (economically) sustainable research in sepsis.","abstract":"The relentless increase in healthcare costs and the global economic crisis require us to rethink the way research is done. The heterogeneity of patients is a major challenge in designing and coordinating high-quality studies about sepsis. Studies on new treatments and devices, such as polymyxin B hemoperfusion, must be optimized not only for potential benefits for a specific population (i.e. efficacy), but also for their eventual implementation in real-world situations (i.e. effectiveness) and for economic costs (i.e. efficiency). In this regard, theragnosis and newer statistical tools could help us obtain useful information from real-life observational data. In this review, we discuss the basic components required for sustainable research in polymyxin B hemoperfusion.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457491","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.729716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Late-2000s recession","weight":0.46667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_recession"},{"name":"Financial crisis","weight":0.418355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.379912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.257106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.198881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Academic major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major"}]}
