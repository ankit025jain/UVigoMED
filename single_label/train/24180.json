{"id":24180,"title":"Antistaphylococcal action of lacto- and bifidobacteria and interleukn-2.","abstract":"Antistaphylococcal action of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMV B-7281, L. acidophilus LMV B-7279 and Bifidobacterium animalis VKB as well as interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been determined on the model of experimental staphylococcal infection in mice. It has been established that peroral administration of certain probiotic strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria or composition L. acidophilus LMV B-7279--L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMV B-7281 with IL-2 to mice favored the reducing of terms of staphylococcus persistence in the kidneys of experimental mice. The studied schemes are promising for treatment of patients with surgical infection.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450180","annotations":[{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.784194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.72209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.278737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Lactobacillus acidophilus","weight":0.136252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_acidophilus"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus","weight":0.0932836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_delbrueckii_subsp._bulgaricus"},{"name":"Bifidobacterium","weight":0.0727563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifidobacterium"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Staphylococcal infection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcal_infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Persistence (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Iveco LMV","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iveco_LMV"},{"name":"Industrija motornih vozil","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrija_motornih_vozil"},{"name":"Scheme (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Bifidobacterium animalis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifidobacterium_animalis"}]}
