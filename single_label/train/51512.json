{"id":51512,"title":"Comparison of quality of life in a group of Lebanese type 1 diabetics on insulin pump and those on multiple daily injections.","abstract":"The aim of the study is to investigate the differences in the quality of life (QOL) in Lebanese youths with type 1 diabetes using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and those using multiple daily injections (MDI) treatment modalities.A descriptive, cross-sectional, comparative matched design was used. The sample included 36 adolescents and young adults on one of two treatment modalities (CSII or MDI) and matched for age, gender, and level of education. QOL was measured with the Indiana Diabetes Quality of Life for Youth and latest HbA1C level was recorded.The CSII group had significantly lower HbA1C levels (p < 0.001), and reported better health perception (p = 0.029), more satisfaction with life (p = 0.002), less impact of the disease (p = 0.002), and fewer worries about their disease (p = 0.029), compared to the MDI group. The overall quality of life score was also significantly better in the CSII group than in the MDI group (p = 0.001).Findings suggest that CSII is associated with better glycemic control and QOL in the Lebanese youth population with type 1 diabetes.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684122","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.856556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.623267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Insulin pump","weight":0.515674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_pump"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.452303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lebanon","weight":0.437221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.308728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Conventional insulinotherapy","weight":0.108378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_insulinotherapy"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Indiana","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"}]}
