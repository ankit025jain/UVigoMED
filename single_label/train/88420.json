{"id":88420,"title":"Recombinant interleukin-12, but not granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, improves survival in lethally irradiated nonhuman primates in the absence of supportive care: evidence for the development of a frontline radiation medical countermeasure.","abstract":"Hematopoietic syndrome of acute radiation syndrome (HSARS) is a life-threatening condition with no approved treatment. We compared recombinant human interleukin-12 (rHuIL-12; 175 ng/kg × 1) with vehicle, granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; 10 µg/kg/day × 18), or rHuIL-12+G-CSF after lethal irradiation in rhesus monkeys in a Good Laboratory Practice, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study. Fluids, antibiotics, and blood products were not used. Survival at day 60 was significantly increased for rHuIL-12 versus G-CSF or vehicle. rHuIL-12/G-CSF combination provided no additional survival benefit over rHuIL-12. Both rHuIL-12 and rHuIL-12+G-CSF increased blood cell nadirs, induced earlier recovery of all hematopoietic lineages, and significantly decreased frequencies of severe cytopenias versus vehicle or G-CSF. In bone marrow, rHuIL-12 alone increased erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocyte counts relative to vehicle or G-CSF. Thus, a single injection of rHuIL-12, without supportive medical intervention, significantly improved survival and promoted multilineage hematopoietic recovery in a nonhuman primate model of HSARS.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852354","annotations":[{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.920564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Megakaryocyte","weight":0.713027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megakaryocyte"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.708148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.682034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.557294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.550483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.456328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.447581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rhesus macaque","weight":0.436718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque"},{"name":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.363837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood product","weight":0.333738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_product"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cytopenia","weight":0.279067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopenia"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.144121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Monkey","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Taxon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
