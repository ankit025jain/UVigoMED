{"id":89334,"title":"Breast cholesterol granuloma: a report of two cases with discussion on potential pathogenesis.","abstract":"Breast cholesterol granuloma is a very rare lesion that can clinically and radiologically mimic breast carcinoma. Herein, we report two cases of breast cholesterol granulomas along with clinical, radiological, cytological and histological findings. We also discuss the potential pathogenesis of this rare breast nodular lesion, suggesting its relation not only to mammary duct ectasia but also to the rupture of a breast macrocyst.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24730340","annotations":[{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.64799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.317887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"}]}
