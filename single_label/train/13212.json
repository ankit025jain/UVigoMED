{"id":13212,"title":"Genetic diversity and phylogenetic analysis of glycoprotein gp85 of avian leukosis virus subgroup J wild-bird isolates from Northeast China.","abstract":"Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), first isolated in 1989, preferentially infects meat-type birds. Chinese layer flocks have experienced outbreaks of this virus since 2008. To analyze the status of ALV-J infection in wild birds in China, 585 wild birds collected from three provinces of Northeast China from 2010 to 2012 were tested, and six ALV-J strains were isolated for the first time. Furthermore, the gp85 genes of the six strains were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The results indicated that two different ALV-J strains coexisted in Chinese wild birds from 2010 to 2012. These results not only expand the epidemiological data available for ALV-J and provide necessary information for the further understanding of the evolution of ALV-J, but they also highlight the potential role of wild-bird migration in the spread of ALV-J.
