{"id":9898,"title":"The use of mouse models of breast cancer and quantitative image analysis to evaluate hormone receptor antigenicity after microwave-assisted formalin fixation.","abstract":"Microwave methods of fixation can dramatically shorten fixation times while preserving tissue structure; however, it remains unclear if adequate tissue antigenicity is preserved. To assess and validate antigenicity, robust quantitative methods and animal disease models are needed. We used two mouse mammary models of human breast cancer to evaluate microwave-assisted and standard 24-hr formalin fixation. The mouse models expressed four antigens prognostic for breast cancer outcome: estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Ki67, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Using pathologist evaluation and novel methods of quantitative image analysis, we measured and compared the quality of antigen preservation, percentage of positive cells, and line plots of cell intensity. Visual evaluations by pathologists established that the amounts and patterns of staining were similar in tissues fixed by the different methods. The results of the quantitative image analysis provided a fine-grained evaluation, demonstrating that tissue antigenicity is preserved in tissues fixed using microwave methods. Evaluation of the results demonstrated that a 1-hr, 150-W fixation is better than a 45-min, 150-W fixation followed by a 15-min, 650-W fixation. The results demonstrated that microwave-assisted formalin fixation can standardize fixation times to 1 hr and produce immunohistochemistry that is in every way commensurate with longer conventional fixation methods.
