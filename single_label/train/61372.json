{"id":61372,"title":"Conservative management of cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma in pregnancy.","abstract":"Cavernous sinus cavernous hemangiomas in pregnancy are extremely rare lesions. The precise management of these lesions remains unknown. The authors present a case of a cavernous hemangioma in pregnancy, centered within the cavernous sinus that underwent postpartum involution without surgical intervention. A 34-year-old pregnant patient (gravida 1, para 0) presented to an otolaryngologist with persistent headache and left-sided facial pain and numbness in the V1 distribution. While being treated for sinusitis, her symptoms progressed to include a left-sided oculomotor palsy and abducens palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging without contrast revealed an expansile mass within the left cavernous sinus consistent with a cavernous hemangioma. The patient was evaluated by a neurosurgeon who recommended close follow-up and postpartum imaging without surgical intervention. Although the lesion enlarged during pregnancy, the patient was able to undergo an uncomplicated cesarean section at 37 weeks. All facial and ocular symptoms resolved by 9 months postpartum, and MRI showed a decrease in lesion size and reduced mass effect. The authors conclude that nonsurgical management may be a viable approach in patients who have an onset or exacerbation of symptoms associated with cavernous sinus cavernous hemangiomas during pregnancy because postpartum involution may negate the need for surgical intervention.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724853","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Paresthesia","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.721188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.626748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.597485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.533406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.501002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Oculomotor nerve","weight":0.446933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculomotor_nerve"},{"name":"Parity (biology)","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(biology)"},{"name":"Abducens nerve","weight":0.307222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abducens_nerve"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Cavernous sinus","weight":0.288198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavernous_sinus"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.241274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Visual cortex","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex"},{"name":"Conservative Party (UK)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"},{"name":"Cavernous hemangioma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavernous_hemangioma"},{"name":"Glossary of terms associated with gravidity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_terms_associated_with_gravidity"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Mass effect (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_effect_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
