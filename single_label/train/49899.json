{"id":49899,"title":"Managing chronic conditions: economic analysis can help mitigate costs of diabetic ulcers.","abstract":"Hospital finance leaders should perform economic analyses of emerging treatments for chronic conditions that could provide cost-effective alternatives to generally accepted standards of care. One such treatment for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) is noncontact low-frequency ultrasound, which has been shown to reduce both costs and healing times associated with these conditions. By reviewing results of clinical trials to understand the costs and treatment considerations for DFUs and other chronic conditions, finance leaders can engage in informed conversations with physicians on how best to manage costs.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851459","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.72699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.336381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.210637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.169901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Chronic wound","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_wound"}]}
