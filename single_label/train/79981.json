{"id":79981,"title":"Efficacy of Withania somnifera chemotypes NMITLI - 101R, 118R and Withaferin A against experimental visceral leishmaniasis.","abstract":"The immunoprophylactic and therapeutic potentials of root extracts of Withania somnifera chemotypes (NMITLI-118, NMITLI-101) and pure withanolide-withaferin A was investigated against Leishmania donovani infection in hamsters. The naive animals, fed orally with immunostimulatory doses of chemotypes 101R, 118R (10 and 3 mg/kg) and withaferin A (9 and 3 mg/kg) for five consecutive days and challenged with Leishmania parasites on day 6, were euthanized on days 30 and 45 p.c. for the assessment of parasite clearance, real-time analysis of mRNAs of Th1/Th2 cytokines (IFN-?, IL-12, TNF-?, iNOS/IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-?), NO production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, lymphocyte transformation test and antibody responses. By day 45 p.c., there was a significant increase in the mRNA expression of iNOS, IFN-?, IL-12 and TNF-? but decrease in IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-?, an enhanced Leishmania-specific LTT response as well as ROS, NO and antileishmanial IgG2 levels in 101R-treated hamsters followed by 118R- and withaferin A-treated ones, respectively. When these chemotypes were given to L. donovani-infected hamsters at different doses, there was moderate therapeutic efficacy of chemotype 101R (~50%) at 30 mg/kg × 5 followed by the other two. The results established that the 101R is the most potential chemotype and can be evaluated for combination therapy along with available antileishmanials.
