{"id":17658,"title":"Metal complexes of ONO donor Schiff base ligand as a new class of bioactive compounds: synthesis, characterization and biological evolution.","abstract":"Present work reviews that, the synthesis of (E)-N'-((7-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxo-2H-chromen-8-yl)methylene)benzohydrazide [L] ligand and their metal complexes. The colored complexes were prepared of type [M(2+)L]X2, where M(2+)=Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Sr and Cd, L=(7-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxo-2H-chromen-8-yl)methylene)benzohydrazide, X=Cl(-). Ligand derived from the condensation of 8-formyl-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin and benzohydrazide in the molar ratio 1:1 and in the molar ratio 1:2 for metal complexes have been prepared. The chelation of the ligand to metal ions occurs through the both oxygen groups, as well as the nitrogen atoms of the azomethine group of the ligand. Reactions of the Schiff base ligand with Manganese(II), Cobalt(II), Nickel(II), Copper(II), Strontium(II), and Cadmium(II) afforded the corresponding metal complexes. The structures of the obtained ligand and their respective metal complexes were elucidated by infra-red, elemental analysis, Double beam UV-visible spectra, conductometric measurements, magnetic susceptibility measurements and also thermochemical studies. The metal complex exhibits octahedral coordination geometrical arrangement. Schiff base ligand and their metal complexes were tested against antioxidants, antidiabetic and antimicrobial activities have been studied. The Schiff base metal complexes emerges effective ?-glucosidase inhibitory activity than free Schiff base ligand.
