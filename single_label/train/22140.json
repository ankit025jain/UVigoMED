{"id":22140,"title":"Clinical value of dual-phase 18F-FDG SPECT with serum procalcitonin for identification of etiology in tumor patients with fever of unknown origin.","abstract":"The purpose of the study was to evaluate clinical value of dual-phase 18F-FDG SPECT with serum procalcitonin (PCT) in identifying cancers in patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO).PCT test and dual-phase 18F-FDG SPECT were sequentially performed on 50 consecutive patients with FUO. Two radiologists evaluated all 18F-FDG SPECT data independently. A consensus was reached if any difference of opinions existed. Final diagnosis was based on a comprehensive analysis of results for the PCT test, dual- phase 18F-FDG SPECT and bacterial cultivation, regarded as a gold standard.Among 50 patients, 34 demonstrated PCT ? 0.5 ?g/L. Coincidence imaging showed in 37 patients with inflammatory lesions, and 13 with malignancy. Finally, 36 bacterial, 1 fungal and 1 viral infections, as well as 12 cancerous fevers were confirmed by dual-phase 18F-FDG SPECT with PCT, combined with bacterial cultivation and clinical follow-up.Our study demonstrated that dual-phase 18F-FDG SPECT in association with PCT could be a valuable tool for diagnosis in tumor patients with FUO.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568478","annotations":[{"name":"Virus","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.797734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Single-photon emission computed tomography","weight":0.79244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever of unknown origin","weight":0.583969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever_of_unknown_origin"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.259376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.124458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Horticulture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Porphyria cutanea tarda","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyria_cutanea_tarda"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"}]}
