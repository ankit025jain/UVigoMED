{"id":23812,"title":"In silico analysis of potential human T Cell antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis for the development of subunit vaccines against tuberculosis.","abstract":"In silico analysis was used to predict MHC class I and class II promiscuous epitopes and potential antigens, from 24 novel T cell antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Majority of the antigens (16/24) had high affinity peptides to both MHC class I and class II alleles and higher population coverage compared to well-proven T cell antigens ESAT-6, CFP-10 and Ag85B. Among these, highest population coverage were calculated for three novel T cell antigens Rv0733 (97.24%), Rv0462 (96.9%) and Rv2251 (96.3%). The prediction results were experimentally tested by in vitro stimulation of these novel T cell antigens with blood drawn from QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-IT) positive healthy household contacts of tuberculosis patients and pulmonary TB patients. Significantly higher level interferon-? (IFN-?) was observed, with these novel T cell antigens, in healthy household contacts compared to pulmonary TB subjects (p?=?0.0001). In silico analysis also resulted in prediction of 36 promiscuous epitopes from the novel 24 T cell antigens. Population coverage for 4 out of the 36 promiscuous epitopes was >90% [67 VVLLWSPRS (Rv1324), 42 VVGVTTNPS (Rv1448c), 178 MRFLLSAKS (Rv0242c) and 842 IRLMALVEY (Rv3800c)]. Our results shows that these novel antigens and promiscuous epitopes identified from our analysis can further be investigated for their usefulness for subunit vaccine development.
