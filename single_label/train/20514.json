{"id":20514,"title":"Description of a new Mycobacterium intracellulare pattern of PCR restriction enzyme analysis of hsp65 gene.","abstract":"This work comprises 9 pulmonary nontuberculous mycobateria isolates obtained from sputum of 4 different patients from Brazil. The sequencing and phylogenetic analysis allowed their accurate identification as Mycobacterium intracellulare. We report a mutation at position 453 creating a new HaeIII cutting site and, therefore, a new PRA-hsp65 M. intracellulare profile.
