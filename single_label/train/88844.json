{"id":88844,"title":"Tibial fractures in children. A retrospective 27-year follow-up study.","abstract":"Tibial fracture is the third most common long-bone fracture in children. Traditionally, most tibial fractures in children have been treated non-operatively, but there are no long-term results.94 children (64 boys) were treated for a tibial fracture in Aurora City Hospital during the period 1980-89 but 20 could not be included in the study. 58 of the remaining 74 patients returned a written questionnaire and 45 attended a follow-up examination at mean 27 (23-32) years after the fracture.89 children had been treated by manipulation under anesthesia and cast-immobilization, 4 by skeletal traction, and 1 with pin fixation. 41 fractures had been re-manipulated. The mean length of hospital stay was 5 (1-26) days. Primary complications were recorded in 5 children. The childrens' memories of treatment were positive in two-thirds of cases. The mean subjective VAS score (range 0-10) for function appearance was 9. Leg-length discrepancy (5-10 mm) was found clinically in 10 of 45 subjects and rotational deformities exceeding 20° in 4. None of the subjects walked with a limp. None had axial malalignment exceeding 10°. Osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee was seen in radiographs from 2 subjects.The long-term outcome of tibial fractures in children treated non-operatively is generally good.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24786903","annotations":[{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.647165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.42684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.394913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.346727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.242274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.242241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.23704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.215641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.194684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Manipulation under anesthesia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipulation_under_anesthesia"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Professional wrestling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"24th century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24th_century_BC"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Limp","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limp"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Aurora (astronomy)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy)"}]}
