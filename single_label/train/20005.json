{"id":20005,"title":"Preventing diseases and outbreaks at child care centers using an education, evaluation, and inspection method.","abstract":"From 2005 to 2008, Washoe County, Nevada, child care centers experienced an increase in illnesses from communicable disease outbreaks. The number of ill children and caregivers from these outbreaks went from 26 in 2005 to 266 in 2008, an increase of 923%. A clear need to reverse this trend existed. Therefore, in 2009 Washoe County strengthened its regulations for child care facilities by adding numerous communicable disease prevention standards. In addition, in 2009 a two-year education, evaluation, and inspection program was implemented at Washoe County child care centers. Following the implementation of this program, a decline occurred in the number of illnesses. The number of ill children and caregivers from outbreaks went from 266 in 2008 to 13 in 2011, a decrease of 95%.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683935","annotations":[{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.538274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Child care","weight":0.190491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_care"},{"name":"Nevada","weight":0.154061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.122221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.114122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Washoe County, Nevada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washoe_County,_Nevada"},{"name":"Inspection","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspection"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"923","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/923"},{"name":"266","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/266"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Law of Austria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Austria"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
