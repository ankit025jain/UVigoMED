{"id":19659,"title":"Staphylococcus aureus nasal and pharyngeal carriage in Senegal.","abstract":"Nasal and pharyngeal swabs were collected from 132 patients admitted to the Principal Hospital in Dakar (Senegal), in January and February 2012. The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus carriage was 56.1% (n = 74): 40.2% for pharyngeal samples and 36.4% for nasal samples. None of the isolates was methicillin-resistant. Carriage was independently associated with being female (p <0.01) and large households (?15 members) (p 0.04). The luk-PV genes encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) were present in 26.2% of the isolates. These data highlight the importance of the oropharynx as a site of colonization, and the high prevalence of PVL-positive isolates in Senegal as compared with industrialized countries.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707853","annotations":[{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.664554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.142583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Senegal","weight":0.115579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Industrialisation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Dakar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar"},{"name":"Oropharynx","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oropharynx"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Sailor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor"},{"name":"Carriage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage"},{"name":"Nasal cavity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Dean (education)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(education)"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Panton-Valentine leukocidin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panton-Valentine_leukocidin"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Leukocidin","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocidin"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
