{"id":91784,"title":"The effect of zoledronic acid on the fracture risk in men  with osteoporosis.","abstract":"Prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized studies on osteoporosis treatment with bisphosphonates in men are rare. This review focuses on a recent trial and compares the results with other studies.This review provides a summary of recent literature on fracture risk in men following treatment with zoledronic acid. According to a recent clinical study with 1,199 men, zoledronic acid was linked to a lower risk of vertebral fractures. In this manuscript, a re-analysis of the presented statistical data will be demonstrated by performing a Bonferroni-correction to adjust for type 1 error accumulation in multiple statistical tests.It will be shown that the provided evidence linking zoledronic acid to a lower fracture risk in male osteoporosis is true, but less pronounced than originally assumed.Comparative clinical studies are recommended, where the benefits of different bisphosphonates are compared to each other under the same experimental conditions.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474679","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.706631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.657294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.474907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.150554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Zoledronic acid","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoledronic_acid"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.108111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Meteorological reanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorological_reanalysis"},{"name":"Bisphosphonate","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
