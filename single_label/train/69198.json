{"id":69198,"title":"Current treatment of renal artery aneurysms may be too aggressive.","abstract":"Most studies recommend repair of renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) >2 cm in diameter in asymptomatic patients, but other studies have suggested that their natural history may be more benign. We hypothesized that rupture and death in patients with asymptomatic RAAs is low and that current recommendations for RAA treatment at 2 cm may be too aggressive.Retrospective review of all RAAs treated at a tertiary care medical center from 2002 to 2012.Fifty-nine RAA were identified in 40 patients (mean age at diagnosis, 56 years; male:female ratio, 17:23); 31 were saccular, 8 were fusiform, and 5 were bilobed. Twenty-nine patients were asymptomatic; the remainder of patients presented with hematuria (n = 4), abdominal pain (n = 3), difficult-to-control hypertension (n = 3), or flank pain (n = 2). Aneurysm location included the main renal artery bifurcation (n = 35), main trunk (n = 7), primary branch (n = 6), pole artery (n = 6), and secondary branch (n = 1). Operative management of RAAs included vein patch (n = 6), prosthetic patch (n = 4), primary repair (n = 3), plication (n = 1), patch and implantation (n = 1), and ex vivo repair (n = 1). Eight asymptomatic RAAs were treated surgically (mean RAA diameter = 2.4 ± 0.1 cm, range, 2-3 cm), with the remaining 33 asymptomatic RAAs being managed conservatively (mean RAA diameter = 1.4 ± 0.1 cm, range, 0.6-2.6 cm). Mean hospital length of stay was 4 days, with no late postoperative complications and 0% mortality. Non-operated patients were followed for a mean of 36 ± 9 months, with no late acute complications and 0% mortality. Mean RAA growth rate of patients with multiple imaging studies was 0.60 ± 0.16 mm/y.The rate of aneurysm rupture and death in our untreated RAA patients is zero, the growth rate is 0.60 ± 0.16 mm/y, and there were no adverse outcomes in asymptomatic RAAs >2 cm that were observed. We may currently be too aggressive in treating asymptomatic RAAs.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462256","annotations":[{"name":"Hematuria","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.6469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.547214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.52321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.487259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.423819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.402615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.363573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.322781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.259055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Branch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Transdermal patch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal_patch"},{"name":"Manager (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0136898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"}]}
