{"id":68233,"title":"Phase II randomized study of figitumumab plus docetaxel and docetaxel alone with crossover for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.","abstract":"Figitumumab is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody targeting insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), with antitumor activity in prostate cancer. This phase II trial randomized chemotherapy-na√Øve men with progressing castration-resistant prostate cancer to receive figitumumab every 3 weeks with docetaxel/prednisone (Arm A) or docetaxel/prednisone alone (Arm B1). At progression on Arm B1, patients could cross over to the combination (Arm B2).Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was the primary endpoint; response assessment on the two arms was noncomparative and tested separately; H0 = 0.45 versus HA = 0.60 (? = 0.05; ? = 0.09) for Arm A; H0 = 0.05 versus HA = 0.20 (? = 0.05, ? = 0.10) for Arm B2. A comparison of progression-free survival (PFS) on Arms A and B1 was planned.A total of 204 patients were randomized and 199 treated (Arm A: 97; Arm B1: 102); 37 patients crossed over to Arm B2 (median number of cycles started: Arm A = 8; B1 = 8; B2 = 4). PSA responses occurred in 52% and 60% of Arms A and B1, respectively; the primary PSA response objective in Arm A was not met. Median PFS was 4.9 and 7.9 months, respectively (HR = 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.96). PSA response rate was 28% in Arm B2. The figitumumab combination appeared more toxic, with more treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events (75% vs. 56%), particularly hyperglycemia, diarrhea, and asthenia, as well as treatment-related serious adverse events (41% vs. 15%), and all-causality grade 5 adverse events (18% vs. 8%).IGF-1R targeting may merit further evaluation in this disease in selected populations, but combination with docetaxel is not recommended.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24536060","annotations":[{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.842185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.746031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.644892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.550591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.462103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Phase II trial","weight":0.127538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_II_trial"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1_receptor"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.111231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Chromosomal crossover","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover"}]}
