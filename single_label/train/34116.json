{"id":34116,"title":"The influence of visual and tactile perception on hand control in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.","abstract":"To investigate tactile perception and manual dexterity, with or without visual feedback, in males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).Forty males with DMD (mean age 9 y 8 mo, SD 2 y 3 mo; range 5-14 y), recruited from the teaching hospital of the School of Medicine of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, with disease severity graded as '1' to '6' on the Vignos Scale and '1' on Brooke's Scale, and 49 healthy males (mean age 8 y 2 mo; range 5-11 y; SD 1 y 11 mo), recruited from a local education center, participated in the study. We assessed tactile perception using two-point discrimination and stereognosis tests, and manual dexterity using the Pick-Up test with the eyes either open or closed. Analysis of variance was used to compare groups; a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Males with DMD exhibited no impairment in tactile perception, as measured by the two-point discrimination test and the number of objects correctly named in the stereognosis test. Manipulation during stereognosis was statistically slower with both hands (p<0.001), and manual dexterity was much worse in males with DMD when there was no visual feedback (p<0.001).Males with DMD exhibited disturbances in manipulation during stereognosis and dexterity tests. Hand control was highly dependent on visual information rather than on tactile perception. Motor dysfunction in males with DMD, therefore, might be related to altered neural control.","date":"2014-08-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766613","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.672841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.592836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Muscular dystrophy","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.294999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.235948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.219076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0562587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"P-value","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"},{"name":"Stereognosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereognosis"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Fine motor skill","weight":0.0195416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_motor_skill"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Sicherheitsdienst","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicherheitsdienst"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Optical feedback","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_feedback"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Discrimination testing","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_testing"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Psychological manipulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation"},{"name":"Butterfly Bomb","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_Bomb"},{"name":"California's 1st State Senate district","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_1st_State_Senate_district"}]}
