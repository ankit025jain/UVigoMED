{"id":47512,"title":"[Robotic-assisted minimally invasive abdominothoracal oesophageal resection with intrathoracic anastomosis].","abstract":"Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy is one of the approaches used worldwide for treating oesophageal cancer. The adoption of minimally invasive oesophagectomy has increased worldwide since its first description more than 15 years ago. However, minimally invasive oesophagectomy with a chest anastomosis has advantages. By using a four-arm robotic platform, not only the preparation of the gastric tube and mobilisation of the oesophagus but also the intrathoracic anastomosis of the oesophagogastrostomy can be performed in a comfortable and safe way.The indication for oesophageal resection is oesophageal cancer.The operative procedure comprises robotic-assisted abdominothoracal oesophageal resection with reconstruction by a gastric tube and intrathoracic anastomosis (Ivor Lewis procedure).Robotic abdominal and thoracic minimally invasive esophagectomy is feasible, and safe with a complete lymph node dissection. Especially the intrathoracic anastomosis of the oesophagogastrostomy can be performed in a comfortable and safe way.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585191","annotations":[{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.891218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Esophagectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagectomy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.817748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.729313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Thoracic cavity","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.259241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.207234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Ivor Lewis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivor_Lewis"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"}]}
