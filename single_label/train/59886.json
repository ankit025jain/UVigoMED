{"id":59886,"title":"Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (Rosai-Dorfman disease) of the true vocal cord.","abstract":"Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) is a rare disorder involving massive benign proliferation of histiocytes in the lymph nodes. The etiology is unknown and the disease usually presents as painless lymphadenopathy accompanied with fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Due to its rarity, the disease is still difficult to diagnose when associated with extranodal involvement. We present an unusual case of a 39-year-old African American female with RDD involving the left true vocal cord.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080658","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Night sweats","weight":0.777657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_sweats"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.527298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.496316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Histiocyte","weight":0.476225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiocyte"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.475356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.242892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Histiocytosis","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiocytosis"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
