{"id":76678,"title":"Association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with race/ethnicity and constitutive skin color in urban schoolchildren.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which constitutive skin color explains racial/ethnic differences in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations in urban schoolchildren. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to determine associations of 25OHD with parent-reported race/ethnicity and constitutive skin color as measured by reflectance colorimeter [individual typology angle (ITA°; higher value corresponds to lighter skin)] in 307 Greater Boston schoolchildren aged 9-15 during October-December 2011. Nearly 60% of all children were inadequate in 25OHD (<20 ng/mL). Prevalence of inadequate 25OHD differed by race/ethnicity (p<0.001): white (46.6%), black (74.5%), Hispanic (64.7%), Asian (88.9%), and multi-racial/other (52.7%). Serum 25OHD increased 0.6 ng/mL per 10° increase in ITA° value (p<0.001). The prediction of 25OHD by race/ethnicity was slightly stronger than the prediction by skin color in separate models (R2=0.19, R2=0.16, respectively). Most of the variability in 25OHD in race/ethnicity was due to constitutive skin color in this group of racially diverse US children.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24945426","annotations":[{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Boston","weight":0.475957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Greater Boston","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Boston"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Human skin color","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin_color"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"White","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Black","weight":0.146946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Analysis of covariance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_covariance"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"915","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/915"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Reflectivity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectivity"},{"name":"Covariance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Lighter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighter"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
