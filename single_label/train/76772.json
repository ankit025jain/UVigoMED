{"id":76772,"title":"Eruptive xanthomas masquerading as molluscum contagiosum.","abstract":"Eruptive xanthomas are cutaneous manifestations of hyperlipidemias in which lipids accumulate in large foam cells within the skin. They classically present as crops of 1- to 4-mm yellow-orange papules and are often associated with extreme hypertriglyceridemia. We describe a 12-year-old boy with autism who was thought to have widespread molluscum contagiosum for a year before dermatologic consultation was obtained. Recognition of eruptive xanthomas led to the discovery of massive hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglycerides 6853 mg/dL) and diabetes mellitus. Through medical intervention, including insulin and fenofibrate therapy, and dietary modification with weight loss, the xanthomas cleared during the subsequent months, and his serum triglyceride levels nearly normalized.
