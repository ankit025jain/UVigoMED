{"id":92202,"title":"Center-of-pressure total trajectory length is a complementary measure to maximum excursion to better differentiate multidirectional standing limits of stability between individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury and able-bodied individuals.","abstract":"Sensorimotor impairments secondary to a spinal cord injury affect standing postural balance. While quasi-static postural balance impairments have been documented, little information is known about dynamic postural balance in this population. The aim of this study was to quantify and characterize dynamic postural balance while standing among individuals with a spinal cord injury using the comfortable multidirectional limits of stability test and to explore its association with the quasi-static standing postural balance test.Sixteen individuals with an incomplete spinal cord injury and sixteen able-bodied individuals participated in this study. For the comfortable multidirectional limits of stability test, participants were instructed to lean as far as possible in 8 directions, separated by 45Â° while standing with each foot on a forceplate and real-time COP visual feedback provided. Measures computed using the center of pressure (COP), such as the absolute maximal distance reached (COPmax) and the total length travelled by the COP to reach the maximal distance (COPlength), were used to characterize performance in each direction. Quasi-static standing postural balance with eyes open was evaluated using time-domain measures of the COP. The difference between the groups and the association between the dynamic and quasi-static test were analyzed.The COPlength of individuals with SCI was significantly greater (p ? 0.001) than that of able-bodied individuals in all tested directions except in the anterior and posterior directions (p ? 0.039), indicating an increased COP trajectory while progressing towards their maximal distance. The COPmax in the anterior direction was significantly smaller for individuals with SCI. Little association was found between the comfortable multidirectional limits of stability test and the quasi-static postural balance test (r ? -0.658).Standing dynamic postural balance performance in individuals with an incomplete spinal cord injury can be differentiated from that of able-bodied individuals with the comfortable limits of stability test. Performance among individuals with an incomplete spinal cord injury is characterized by lack of precision when reaching. The comfortable limits of stability test provides supplementary information and could serve as an adjunct to the quasi-static test when evaluating postural balance in an incomplete spinal cord injury population.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438202","annotations":[{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.692342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.370755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.203108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.174827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.154468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.139031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Trajectory","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.0304399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Center of pressure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_pressure"},{"name":"Force platform","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_platform"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Rope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope"},{"name":"Supplementary angles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_angles"},{"name":"Excursion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excursion"},{"name":"Optical feedback","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_feedback"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Sensorimotor","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorimotor"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
