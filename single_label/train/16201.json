{"id":16201,"title":"[Proteome mass-spectrometric analysis and typing of Vibrio cholerae strains isolated in the territory of Russian Federation in 2010 - 2012].","abstract":"Conduction of a comparative proteomic mass-spectrometric (MS) analysis using a personal database of V. cholerae protein mass-spectra and genetic VNTR-typing of cholera causative agent strains.V. cholerae O1 El Tor strains - 7, V. cholerae non O1/non O139 - 2. Protein profiling and VNTR-genotyping of strains was carried out on MALDI TOF-MS Autoflex (Bruker Daltonics) mass-spectrometer and SIS Cholera-strains-VNTR.The established community of a proteomic profile of epidemic cholera vibrio strains isolated in 2010 - 2012 in Moscow allowed to determine Indian origin of a toxigenic strain isolated in Taganrog in 2011. M/z proteins distinguishing V. cholerae O1 and non O1/non O139 strains were identified. Proteomic analysis confirms the results of VNTR-genotyping.Study and typing of V. cholerae members with determination of their origin and phylogenetic relationship is possible using a collection of V. cholerae mass-spectra.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051705","annotations":[{"name":"Cholera","weight":0.815556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.716893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.700068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Vibrio cholerae","weight":0.668902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_cholerae"},{"name":"Vibrio","weight":0.618293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.497585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Moscow","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"},{"name":"El Tor","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Tor"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.411436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.375321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"Taganrog","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taganrog"},{"name":"Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix-assisted_laser_desorption/ionization"},{"name":"Bruker","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruker"},{"name":"Proteome","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteome"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Typewriter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Federation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation"},{"name":"O antigen","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_antigen"},{"name":"Secret Intelligence Service","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Conduction (heat)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduction_(heat)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Territory (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)"}]}
