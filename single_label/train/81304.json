{"id":81304,"title":"Soluble toll like receptor 2 (TLR-2) is increased in saliva of children with dental caries.","abstract":"Dental caries is the most common microbial disease affecting mankind. Caries risk assessment methods, identification of biomarkers and vaccine development strategies are being emphasized to control the incidence of the largely preventable disease. Pattern recognition receptors such as the toll like receptors (TLR) have been implicated as modulators of host-microbial interactions. Soluble TLR-2 and its co-receptor, CD14 identified in saliva can bind the cell wall components of cariogenic bacteria and modulate the disease process. The objective of this study is to determine the potential of salivary sTLR-2 and sCD14 as biomarkers of caries activity and indirect measures of the cariogenic bacterial burden.Unstimulated whole saliva was collected from twenty caries free and twenty caries active children between the ages of 5 and 13 years. The concentration of sCD14 and sTLR-2 together with that of the cytokine IL-8 reported to be increased in dental caries was assessed by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.While the level of sCD14 and that of IL-8 was equivocal between the two groups, the sTLR-2 concentration in caries active saliva was significantly higher than that in caries free saliva.The sTLR-2 in saliva could serve as a potential biomarker for caries activity.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174416","annotations":[{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.91239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell wall","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_wall"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.688377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.655419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.58717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"TLR 2","weight":0.449893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_2"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.385833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"CD14","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD14"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.270076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.146135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0818325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Co-receptor","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-receptor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pattern recognition","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"}]}
