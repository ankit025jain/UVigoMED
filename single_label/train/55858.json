{"id":55858,"title":"[Retinoblastoma: recent advances].","abstract":"Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy of infancy with an incidence of 1/15,000 to 1/20,000 births. Sixty percent of retinoblastomas are unilateral, with a median age at diagnosis of two years, and in most cases are not hereditary. Retinoblastoma is bilateral in 40% of cases, with an earlier median age at diagnosis of one year. All bilateral and multifocal unilateral forms are hereditary and are part of a genetic cancer predisposition syndrome. All children with a bilateral or familial form, and 10 to 15% of children with an unilateral form, constitutionally carry an RB1 gene mutation. The two most frequent symptoms revealing retinoblastoma are leukocoria and strabismus. Diagnosis is made by fundoscopy, with ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contributing both to diagnosis and assessment of the extension of the disease. Treatment of patients with retinoblastoma must take into account the various aspects of the disease (unilateral/bilateral, size, localization…), the risk to vision and the possible hereditary nature of the disease. The main prognostic aspects are still premature detection and adapted coverage by a multi-disciplinary specialized team. Enucleation is still often necessary in unilateral disease; the decision for adjuvant treatment is taken according to the histological risk factors. The most important recent therapeutic advances concern the conservative treatment which is proposed for at least one of the two eyes in most bilateral cases: laser alone or in combination with chemotherapy, cryotherapy or brachytherapy. Recently, the development of new conservative techniques of treatment, such as intra-arterial selective chemotherapy perfusion, aims at preserving visual function in these children and decreasing the number of enucleations and the need for external beam radiotherapy. The vital prognosis related to retinoblatoma is now excellent in industrialized countries, but long-term survival is still related to the development of secondary tumors, mainly secondary sarcoma. Retinoblastoma requires multi-disciplinary care as well as a long term specialized follow-up. Early counseling of patients and their family concerning the risk of transmission of the disease and the risk of development of secondary tumors is necessary.
