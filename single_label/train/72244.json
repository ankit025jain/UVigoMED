{"id":72244,"title":"Predictors of benefit finding in the adult children of patients with cancer.","abstract":"This study aimed to investigate the predictors of benefit finding in 311 adult children of patients with cancer. Participants completed a comprehensive online/pen-and-paper survey measuring benefit finding, gender of parent, outcome and duration of illness, caregiving experience, and emotional experiences including reaction to diagnosis and grief and loss. Greater benefit finding was positively associated with stronger emotional experiences, satisfaction with the caregiving role, and outcome of parental cancer, explaining 15.3% of the variance in benefit finding. Higher emotional reactions and outcome of parental cancer as significant predictors of parental cancer provide some support for the applicability of theories of post-traumatic growth to this cohort.
