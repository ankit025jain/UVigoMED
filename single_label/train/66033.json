{"id":66033,"title":"[SCF/c-Kit signaling promotes invasion of T24 cells via PI3K pathway].","abstract":"To explore the role of SCF/c-Kit signaling in the invasion of bladder cancer T24 cells.Western blotting was used to detect the expression of c-Kit and PI3K pathway activation stimulated by stem cell factor (SCF) in T24 cells. The invasiveness of T24 cells before and after SCF stimulation and Wortmannin (aspecific PI3K inhibitor) treatment was evaluated using Transwell invasion assay (direct and indirect counting methods).T24 cells expressed c-Kit protein and showed obvious Akt phosphorylation after stimulation with SCF (1 ng/ml) for 24 h. Compared to the control group, SCF stimulation (1 ng/ml) caused a greater number of T24 cells to migrate through the polycarbonate film (P<0.01), and this effect was blocked by the application of Wortmannin before the stimulation.SCF/c-Kit signaling promotes the invasiveness of T24 cells, and this effect is mediated by the PI3K pathway.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Male Urogenital
