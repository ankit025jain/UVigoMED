{"id":49857,"title":"Impact of prophylactic central compartment neck dissection on locoregional recurrence of differentiated thyroid cancer in clinically node-negative patients: a retrospective study of a large clinical series.","abstract":"In clinically node-negative patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), indications for routine central lymph node dissection (RCLD) are the subject of intensive research, and surgeons are divided between the pros and cons of this surgery. To better define the role of neck dissection in the treatment of DTC, we analyzed retrospectively the results in three centers in Italy.The clinical records of 752 clinically node-negative patients with DTC who underwent operative treatment between January 1998 and December 2005 in three endocrine surgery referral units were evaluated retrospectively. The complications and medium- and long-term outcomes of total thyroidectomy (TT) alone (performed in 390 patients: group A) and TT combined with bilateral RCLD (362 patients: group B) were analyzed and compared.The incidence of permanent hypoparathyroidism and permanent unilateral vocal folds was 1% and 0.8% in group A and 3.6% and 1.7% in the group B, respectively. Bilateral temporary recurrent nerve palsy was observed in one of the 362 patients in group B. After a follow-up of 9.5 ± 3.5 years (mean ± SD), the locoregional recurrence rate with positive cervical lymph nodes was not substantially significantly different between the two groups.In our series, TT combined with bilateral RCLD was associated with a greater rate of transient and permanent complications. Similar incidences of locoregional recurrence were reported in the two groups of patients. Considering the recent trend toward routine central lymphadenectomy, further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of these different approaches.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856120","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Hypoparathyroidism","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoparathyroidism"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Neck dissection","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_dissection"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Recurrent laryngeal nerve","weight":0.708186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_laryngeal_nerve"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Cervical lymph nodes","weight":0.680581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.657294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.45569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.43407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0252209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"}]}
