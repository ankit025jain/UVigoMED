{"id":31827,"title":"One-stage bilateral open reduction using the anterior iliofemoral approach in developmental dysplasia of the hip.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of one-stage bilateral open reduction using the anterior approach in the treatment of patients with bilateral Tönnis Type III and IV Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH). Forty-six patients were retrospectively evaluated. Thirty-eight were female, eight were male. The mean age was 16.63 (11-29) months. The mean follow-up period was 27.18 (12-65) months. The mean hospitalization period after surgery was 1.91 (1-5) days. The mean pre-operative hematocrit level was 35.14% (28.1-44.1) and the mean pre-operative hemoglobin level was 11.75 g/dl (9.3-13.6). The mean post-operative hematocrit level was 32.54% (26.7-40.4) and the mean post-operative hemoglobin level was 10.80 g/dl (8.78-12.3). None of the patients required blood transfusion. The mean anesthesia duration was 133.30 (95-180) minutes, and the mean operation duration was 107.58 (70-145) minutes. According to the modified scoring system by Trevor et al, excellent results were obtained in 66 hips of 46 patients (71.8%), and good results were obtained in 26 hips (28.2%). Twenty two hips (23.91%), which developed acetabular dysplasia in the follow-up period required a secondary acetabular intervention. According to the Kalamchi and MacEwen classification, Type I avascular necrosis developed in ten hips, Type II in one hip, and Type IV in two hips. One-stage bilateral open reduction using the anterior iliofemoral approach in Tönnis Type III and IV DDH at walking age is a safe, time-saving treatment method that shortens the hospitalization and immobilization periods.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090794","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.735241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.70277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.695597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.633662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.595454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.451504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.345037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (human)","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(human)"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.281348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.143995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Dirasha language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirasha_language"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.028018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"740","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/740"},{"name":"313","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/313"},{"name":"1265","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1265"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"78xx","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/78xx"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Iroquois class destroyer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_class_destroyer"},{"name":"Breguet Type III","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breguet_Type_III"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Iliofemoral ligament","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliofemoral_ligament"}]}
