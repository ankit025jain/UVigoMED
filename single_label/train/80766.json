{"id":80766,"title":"Vivax malaria in an Amazonian child with dilated cardiomyopathy.","abstract":"A child living in the Brazilian Amazon region who had had vivax malaria at the age of 11 months was admitted three months later with a history of progressive dyspnoea and fever, which culminated in respiratory distress and severe dilated cardiomyopathy at hospital admission in a malaria-free area. She received treatment for cardiac insufficiency and was tested for malaria with two thick blood smears, which were negative. There was general improvement of cardiorespiratory function in the next two weeks, but in the third week of hospital admission, there was re-appearance of fever, severe anaemia, severe plaquetopaenia, and respiratory distress. A third thick blood smear was positive for Plasmodium vivax mono-infection, which was confirmed by molecular methods. A serological panel with the most prevalent infectious agents known to cause myocarditis was performed, and specific anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM and elevated levels of anti-CMV IgG were also detected in the serum. After treatment for malaria, there was improvement of respiratory distress, although cardiac function did not recover. She was discharged home with drugs for cardiac insufficiency and is currently under follow-up with a paediatric cardiologist as an outpatient. This report presents a young child with several episodes of vivax malaria who suffers from cardiac insufficiency, probably related to CMV-induced myocarditis.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548824","annotations":[{"name":"Myocarditis","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocarditis"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.833344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.818279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.790758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.78525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.769861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.715278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.625538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.624547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Dilated cardiomyopathy","weight":0.607301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilated_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood film","weight":0.534556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_film"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.386841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.130266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0773787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Amazon Rainforest","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Rainforest"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology_diagnostic_tests_and_procedures"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
