{"id":69430,"title":"Laparoscopic and robotic postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.","abstract":"Open surgical postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection remains the standard of care. On the contrary, laparoscopy is an emerging technique and reports of laparoscopic lymph node dissection postchemotherapy are increasing. Our purpose is to present indications, technique and outcomes of laparoscopic postchemo retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.With growing expertise and knowledge the morbidity of the laparoscopic approach is much reduced compared with open surgery with the same oncological outcome. Robotic surgery is a more recent approach with growing usage in urology. However, no reports of robotic postchemotherapy lymph node dissection are available.In expert hands laparoscopic lymph node dissection is a feasible technique, offering less morbidity to patients with good oncological results.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445557","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Robotic surgery","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_surgery"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.694863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.302084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.186248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.121041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
