{"id":86647,"title":"Internet access and use by COPD patients in the National Emphysema/COPD Association Survey.","abstract":"Technology offers opportunities to improve healthcare, but little is known about Internet use by COPD patients. We tested two hypotheses: Internet access is associated with socio-demographic disparities and frequency of use is related to perceived needs.We analyzed data from a 2007-2008 national convenience sample survey of COPD patients to determine the relationship between Internet access and frequency of use with demographics, socio-economic status, COPD severity, and satisfaction with healthcare.Among survey respondents (response rate 7.2%; n = 914, 59.1% women, mean age 71.2 years), 34.2% reported lack of Internet access, and an additional 49% had access but used the Internet less than weekly. Multivariate models showed association between lack of access and older age (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.07, 1.13), lower income (income below $30,000 OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.63, 3.73), less education (high school highest attainment OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.54, 3.45), comorbid arthritis or mobility-related disease (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.05, 2.34). More frequent use (at least weekly) was associated with younger age (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.93, 0.98), absence of cardiovascular disease (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29, 0.78), but with perception of needs insufficiently met by the healthcare system, including diagnostic delay (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.06, 2.78), feeling treated poorly (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.15, 5.24), insufficient physician time (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.02, 5.13), and feeling their physician did not listen (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.42, 6.95).An analysis of the characteristics associated with Internet access and use among COPD patients identified two different patient populations. Lack of Internet access was a marker of socioeconomic disparity and mobility-associated diseases, while frequent Internet use was associated with less somatic disease but dissatisfaction with care.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755090","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.754165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.697579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.682151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.593715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Economic inequality","weight":0.530443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.468387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.465166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.419468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.385244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.339737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.32337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"School","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.19563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.165994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.114558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Working class","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
