{"id":84287,"title":"Small-molecule suppression of ?-lactam resistance in multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.","abstract":"Recent efforts toward combating antibiotic resistance in bacteria have focused on Gram-positive bacteria; however, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a significant risk to public health. An orthogonal approach to the development of new antibiotics is to develop adjuvant compounds that enhance the susceptibility of drug-resistant strains of bacteria to currently approved antibiotics. This paper describes the synthesis and biological activity of a library of aryl amide 2-aminoimidazoles based on a lead structure from an initial screen. A small molecule was identified from this library that is capable of lowering the minimum inhibitory concentration of ?-lactam antibiotics by up to 64-fold.
