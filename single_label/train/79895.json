{"id":79895,"title":"Influence of nutrition on infection and re-infection with soil-transmitted helminths: a systematic review.","abstract":"The relationship between nutrition and soil-transmitted helminthiasis is complex and warrants further investigation. We conducted a systematic review examining the influence of nutrition on infection and re-infection with soil-transmitted helminths (i.e. Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Trichuris trichiura and Strongyloides stercoralis) in humans. Emphasis was placed on the use of nutritional supplementation, alongside anthelminthic treatment, to prevent re-infection with soil-transmitted helminths.We searched eight electronic databases from inception to 31 July 2013, with no restriction of language or type of publication. For studies that met our inclusion criteria, we extracted information on the soil-transmitted helminth species, nutritional supplementation and anthelminthic treatment. Outcomes were presented in forest plots and a summary of findings (SoF) table. An evidence profile (EP) was generated by rating the evidence quality of the identified studies according to the GRADE system.Fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria; eight randomised controlled trials and seven prospective cohort studies. Data on A. lumbricoides were available from all studies, whereas seven and six studies additionally contained data on T. trichiura and hookworm, respectively. None of the studies contained data on S. stercoralis. Positive effects of nutritional supplementation or the host's natural nutritional status on (re-)infection with soil-transmitted helminths were reported in 14 studies, while negative effects were documented in six studies. In terms of quality, a high, low and very low quality rating was assigned to the evidence from four, six and five studies, respectively.Our findings suggest that the current evidence-base is weak, precluding guidelines on nutrition management as a potential supplementary tool to preventive chemotherapy targeting soil-transmitted helminthiasis. Moreover, several epidemiological, immunological and methodological issues have been identified, and these should be considered when designing future studies.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885622","annotations":[{"name":"Hookworm","weight":0.830092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookworm"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.769027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.765803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.67681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.616438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.604483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Anthelmintic","weight":0.494004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthelmintic"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.427343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.350018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Parasitic worm","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.287979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Ascaris lumbricoides","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris_lumbricoides"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Ascaris","weight":0.110498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris"},{"name":"Trichuris","weight":0.0471159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichuris"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Trichuris trichiura","weight":0.0381836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichuris_trichiura"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Forest","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest"},{"name":"Strongyloides stercoralis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongyloides_stercoralis"},{"name":"Helminthiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helminthiasis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Table (information)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)"},{"name":"Bibliographic database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliographic_database"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"}]}
