{"id":66077,"title":"Decreasing need for artificial urinary sphincter revision surgery by precise cuff sizing in men with spongiosal atrophy.","abstract":"Many patients with persistent incontinence after an artificial urinary sphincter procedure gain improved continence after cuff downsizing. In 2010 a new, smaller (3.5 cm) artificial urinary sphincter cuff was introduced. We hypothesized that men with spongiosal atrophy previously treated with a 4.0 cm cuff would now show a decreased rate of revision surgery due to more accurate cuff sizing.We evaluated the outcome in men who received identical 4.0 cm cuff sizes in 2 eras, before (2007 to 2009) and after (2010 to 2013) the introduction of the 3.5 cm artificial urinary sphincter cuff. Patients with a history of cuff erosion or those undergoing tandem, transcorporal, or 4.5 cm or greater cuff placement were excluded from analysis. We validated our institutional results using the nationwide AMS® PIF (Patient Information Form) database from identical time frames.Of 236 men who underwent artificial urinary sphincter placement at our institution during the study period 170 with a mean age of 67 years met study inclusion criteria, of whom 88 (52%) received a 4.0 cm artificial urinary sphincter cuff. Mean followup was 34 months. Ten of 45 patients (22.2%) who had a 4.0 cm cuff placed from 2007 to 2009 required cuff downsizing for persistent incontinence while only 2 of 43 (4.7%) who received a 4.0 cm cuff from 2010 to 2013 required revision (p <0.001). Nationally patients with a 4.0 cm cuff underwent fewer revisions during the latter era (16.2% vs 7.5%, p = 0.001). In local and national cohorts Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed improved survival of the 4.0 cm cuff after the introduction of the 3.5 cm cuff (p <0.05).The incidence of artificial urinary sphincter revision surgery in patients with a 4.0 cm cuff has decreased since the availability of the 3.5 cm cuff. This suggests that precise cuff sizing appears to be beneficial in men with spongiosal atrophy.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746880","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.442079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Organization of American States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_American_States"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sizing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizing"},{"name":"Layoff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff"},{"name":"Tandem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem"},{"name":"Cuff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Patient information leaflet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_information_leaflet"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pipeline forwarding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_forwarding"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"American Meteorological Society","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Meteorological_Society"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"}]}
