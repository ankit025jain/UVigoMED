{"id":85390,"title":"[Ten-year questionnaire survey on adult asthma patients in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan].","abstract":"To decrease the number of asthma deaths occurring in Miyazaki Prefecture in Japan by promoting guideline-based treatment through the bronchial asthma forum.A self-completed questionnaire survey of adult asthma patients was conducted in Miyazaki Prefecture during the same season for 10 consecutive years from 1999 to 2008.A total of 7899 responses were collected from medical institutions throughout the prefecture. In the course of 10 years, the doses of the drugs used for long-term management, including inhaled steroids, long-acting inhaled ?2-stimulants, and leukotriene receptor antagonists, increased year after year. Consequently, the frequency of asthma symptoms declined and there was a decrease in the use of short-acting inhaled ?2-stimulants, parenteral aminophylline, and slow-release theophylline preparations in response to this trend. Prescription rate of inhaled steroids and patients satisfaction was higher in the facilities of specialists than non-specialists. In patients with rhinitis symptoms, asthma was improved by concurrently treating both rhinitis and asthma in the survey of 2008.Asthma treatment based on the guideline was increasing in Miyazaki Prefecture, and this may have resulted in the improvement of asthma symptoms, increased patient satisfaction, and more importantly, a decrease in the number of asthma deaths.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24953739","annotations":[{"name":"Leukotriene","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukotriene"},{"name":"Theophylline","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophylline"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.505486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.459539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.316839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.291815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.265815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.230489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Aminophylline","weight":0.102673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminophylline"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
