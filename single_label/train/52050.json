{"id":52050,"title":"Pancreas transplantation from donors after cardiac death: an update of the UNOS database.","abstract":"There is reluctance to use donation after cardiac death (DCD) organs for fear of worse outcomes due to increased warm ischemia time. Extensive evidence to confirm the quality of DCD pancreas transplants is not manifest.A united network for organ sharing database review of pancreas transplants performed between 1996 and 2012 was conducted. We compared outcomes and all demographic variables between donors after cardiac death and donors after brain death in pancreas transplantation.There were 320 DCD pancreas transplants and 20,448 donation after brain death pancreas transplants performed in the United States between 1996 and 2012. There was no statistically significant difference in graft survival or patient survival in pancreas transplantation in DCD versus donation after brain death donors measured at 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year intervals. There was no significant difference between donor and recipient age, race, sex, and body mass index (BMI) between the groups. There was no significant difference between the recipient ethnicity or time on wait list between the groups.Pancreata procured by DCD have comparable outcomes to those procured after brain death. Donation after cardiac death pancreas transplant is a viable method of increasing the donor pool, decreasing wait list mortality, and improving the quality of life for type 1 diabetic patients.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632550","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Brain death","weight":0.792435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_death"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.786661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.767691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.746993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.744206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.648392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.445855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.27983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.259241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Pancreas transplantation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas_transplantation"},{"name":"Donation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation"},{"name":"1996","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"United Network for Organ Sharing","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Network_for_Organ_Sharing"},{"name":"Non-heart-beating donation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-heart-beating_donation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"}]}
