{"id":36053,"title":"Ulerythema ophryogenes: updates and insights.","abstract":"Ulerythema ophryogenes is a rare cutaneous atrophic disorder that occasionally is associated with Noonan syndrome, de Lange syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, and cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome. Often presenting in pediatric patients, the pathogenesis of ulerythema ophryogenes remains unclear, though several genetic causes have been suggested. Treatment recommendations remain anecdotal, but clearance has been noted as the patient ages. Although topical agents have been the mainstay of therapy, recent advancement in laser intervention for treatment of ulerythema ophryogenes is promising.
