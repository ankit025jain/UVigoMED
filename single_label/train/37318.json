{"id":37318,"title":"Advanced intrauterine growth restriction is associated with reduced excretion of asymmetric dimethylarginine.","abstract":"High blood levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) are associated with future development of adverse cardiovascular events. The ADMA/symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) ratio is a marker of ADMA catabolism, with a high ADMA/SDMA ratio being suggestive of reduced ADMA excretion.This study aimed a) to verify the presence of a statistically significant difference between ADMA/SDMA ratio levels in a group of young adult subjects who were born preterm with an extremely low birth weight (ex-ELBW) and a group of healthy adults born at term and b) to seek correlations between ADMA/SDMA ratio levels in ex-ELBW and anthropometric and clinical parameters (gender, chronological age, gestational age, birth weight, and length of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit).Thirty-seven ex-ELBW subjects (11 males [M] and 26 females [F], aged 17-28 years, mean age: 22.2 ± 1.8 years) were compared with 37 controls (11 M and 26 F). ADMA/SDMA ratio levels were assessed for each patient included in the study.ADMA/SDMA ratio in ex-ELBW subjects was higher compared to controls (1.42 ± 0.31 vs 0.95 ± 0.14, p<0.002) and inversely correlated with birth weight (r=-0.68, p<0.0001) and gestational age (r=-0.54, p<0.0005).ADMA catabolism is significantly decreased in ex-ELBW subjects compared to controls, underlining a probable correlation with restriction of intrauterine growth. These results suggest the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk in ex-ELBW.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503253","annotations":[{"name":"Intrauterine growth restriction","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_growth_restriction"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.56645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.50408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.384098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.296898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0834668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
