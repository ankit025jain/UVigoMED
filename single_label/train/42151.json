{"id":42151,"title":"Altered mRNA levels of MOV10, A3G, and IFN-? in patients with chronic hepatitis B.","abstract":"To explore the relationship of the MOV10, A3G, and IFN-? mRNA levels with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, Blood samples from 96 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 21 healthy individuals as control were collected. HBV DNA load and aminotransferase in the serum were tested using real time PCR and velocity methods, respectively. The MOV10, A3G, and IFN-? mRNA levels in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were examined through qRT-PCR. The MOV10, A3G, and IFN-? mRNA levels in CHB group was significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.01, respectively). The A3G mRNA level in the high-HBV DNA load group was lower than that in the low-HBV DNA load group (P<0.05). However, no statistical difference was found in the MOV10 and IFN-? mRNA levels between the two HBV DNA load groups. Furthermore, the MOV10 mRNA level showed positive correlation with IFN-? in the control group. These results indicated that the expression of the innate immune factors MOV10, A3G, and IFN-? is affected by chronic HBV infection.
