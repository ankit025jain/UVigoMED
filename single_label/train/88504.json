{"id":88504,"title":"Secondary prevention and estimation of fracture risk.","abstract":"The key questions addressed in this chapter are: • How can individual risk of fracture be best estimated? • What is the best system to prevent a further fracture? • How to implement systems for preventing further fractures? Absolute fracture risk calculators (FRCs) provide a means to estimate an individual's future fracture risk. FRCs are widely available and provide clinicians and patients a platform to discuss the need for intervention to prevent fragility fractures. Despite availability of effective osteoporosis medicines for almost two decades, most patients presenting with new fragility fractures do not receive secondary preventive care. The Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) model has been shown in a number of countries to eliminate the care gap in a clinically and cost-effective manner. Leading international and national organisations have developed comprehensive resources and/or national strategy documents to provide guidance on implementation of FLS in local, regional and national health-care systems.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24836336","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.95826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Publicly funded health care","weight":0.195016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_health_care"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Linnean Society of London","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnean_Society_of_London"},{"name":"Pathologic fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Calculator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Chapter (religion)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_(religion)"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"}]}
