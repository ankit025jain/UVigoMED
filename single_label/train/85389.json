{"id":85389,"title":"The chitinase-like protein YKL-40 is not a useful biomarker for severe persistent asthma in children.","abstract":"The chitinase-like protein YKL-40 is thought to play a role in inflammation and tissue remodeling. In adults with severe asthma, YKL-40 is expressed in the airway and YKL-40 levels are elevated in the serum.To compare YKL-40 levels in children with severe persistent asthma with those in adults with severe persistent asthma and to determine whether YKL-40 levels correlate with increasing asthma severity in childhood asthma.In this prospective, cross-sectional study, 23 adults and 19 children with severe persistent asthma, 23 children with moderate persistent asthma, and 19 children with mild persistent asthma were enrolled. The following data were collected on each patient: spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide, percutaneous skin testing results to aeroallergens, peripheral eosinophils, serum IgE levels, and serum YKL-40 levels.Compared with adults, children with severe persistent asthma had significantly lower YKL-40 levels, higher values for forced vital capacity and forced expiration volume in 1 second, higher serum IgE levels, and higher exhaled nitric oxide levels. YKL-40 levels did not correlate with increasing asthma severity in the pediatric cohort.Severe persistent asthma in childhood is not associated with elevated YKL-40 levels, unlike in adults with severe persistent asthma. YKL-40 is not a useful biomarker for asthma severity in childhood asthma.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24954373","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.828539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.827477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.790718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.732203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.72893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.599344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.517291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.486358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.258283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Vital capacity","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_capacity"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.0757863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0584998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Exhaled nitric oxide","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaled_nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
