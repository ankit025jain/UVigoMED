{"id":80458,"title":"Magnetic isolation of Plasmodium falciparum schizonts iRBCs to generate a high parasitaemia and synchronized in vitro culture.","abstract":"The establishment of methods for an in vitro continuous culture of Plasmodium falciparum is essential for gaining knowledge into its biology and for the development of new treatments. Previously, several techniques have been used to synchronize, enrich and concentrate P. falciparum, although obtaining cultures with high parasitaemia continues being a challenging process. Current methods produce high parasitaemia levels of synchronized P. falciparum cultures by frequent changes of culture medium or reducing the haematocrit. However, these methods are time consuming and sometimes lead to the loss of synchrony.A procedure that combines Percoll and sorbitol treatments, the use of magnetic columns, and the optimization of the in vitro culture conditions to reach high parasitaemia levels for synchronized Plasmodium falciparum cultures is described.A new procedure has been established using P. falciparum 3D7, combining previous reported methodologies to achieve in vitro parasite cultures that reach parasitaemia up to 40% at any intra-erythrocytic stage. High parasitaemia levels are obtained only one day after magnetic column purification without compromising the parasite viability and synchrony.The described procedure allows obtaining a large scale synchronized parasite culture at a high parasitaemia with less manipulations than other methods previously described.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655321","annotations":[{"name":"Biology","weight":0.671238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.363254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.269585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Spin column-based nucleic acid purification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_column-based_nucleic_acid_purification"},{"name":"Sorbitol","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbitol"},{"name":"Synchronization","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Column","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"},{"name":"Isolationism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism"},{"name":"Water purification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_purification"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.016711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"}]}
