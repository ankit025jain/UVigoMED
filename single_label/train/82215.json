{"id":82215,"title":"The use of free fat tissue transfer from the buccal fat pad to obtain and maintain primary closure and to improve soft tissue thickness at bone-augmented sites: technique presentation and report of case series.","abstract":"Atrophic ridges usually have both hard and soft tissue shortages, and bone augmentation can make soft tissue closure difficult. The aim of this case series is to present a new method utilizing transfer of free fat tissue grafts (FFG) from the buccal fat bad (BFP) during bone augmentation to enhance immediate primary soft tissue closure and improve long-term soft tissue thickness and quality at the recipient site.Patients with moderate to severe ridge atrophy in different regions of the jaws were treated over a 4-year period with bone augmentation and FFG. The BFP was the donor site for the FFG. Patients were examined clinically and radiographically (periapical) every 2 weeks. At 4 months, computed tomography was performed to evaluate the bone gain. Reentry was performed after 4 to 5 months to evaluate the soft tissue, obtain specimens for histologic examination, and insert implants.Twenty patients (18 women, 2 men; mean age 43 years) were followed for 4 to 42 months and received 92 implants in the augmented sites. The healing process was uneventful, with minimal morbidity. Bone volume increased by 4 to 8 mm horizontally and 3 to 6 mm vertically. Thick soft tissue was obtained at the recipient sites and around the dental implants, and histologic specimens showed that the FFG was replaced by fibrous tissue.Harvesting of the FFG from the BFP is a simple procedure with minor complications, and manipulation and handling of the graft are easy. The FFG enhances primary soft tissue closure of augmented bone, prevents dehiscences, improves long-term soft tissue thickness, and mimics the attached gingiva in its fibrous healing.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683585","annotations":[{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.717489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.672261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.38838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.387499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.38626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.355093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.30316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.229215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.167804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.151377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"}]}
