{"id":81779,"title":"Efficacy of Papacarie(®) in reduction of residual bacteria in deciduous teeth: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of Papacarie(®) gel compared with the traditional method (low-speed bur) in reducing the counts of total bacteria, Lactobacillus, total Streptococcus and Streptococcus mutans group.Reductions were found in the numbers of total bacteria, total Streptococcus and Streptococcus mutans group following either of the caries removal methods (p<0.05). A reduction was also noted in the number of Lactobacillus CFUs; however, this difference did not achieve statistical significance (p>0.05).Papacarie(®) is an excellent option for the minimally invasive removal of carious tissue, achieving significant reductions in total bacteria, total Streptococcus and S. mutans with the same effectiveness as the traditional caries removal method.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838896","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.772597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.555634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.521852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.516083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Streptococcus mutans","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_mutans"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.343833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.325499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.209553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Deciduous","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous"},{"name":"Deciduous teeth","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_teeth"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Indian Reductions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Reductions"},{"name":"Sparkling wine production","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkling_wine_production"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Bur","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bur"}]}
