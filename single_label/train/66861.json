{"id":66861,"title":"[Detection of serum food specific antibodies of 6 common foods in patients with IgA nephropathy].","abstract":"To explore the relationship between the major allergens of 6 common allergic foods and IgA nephropathy.A sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the serum levels of food-specific IgA1, IgG and IgE in 31 patients with IgA nephropathy and 80 healthy volunteers. All the patients were examined for a history of food allergy using a questionnaire.Serum levels of IgA1 and IgG against the major allergens of the 6 common allergic foods were significantly higher in patients with IgA nephropathy than in healthy volunteers (P<0.05). There was no detectable food-specific IgE antibodies in the two groups. No patients had a clear history of food allergy. All the patients with increased IgG levels specific to 4 or more foods simultaneously had proteinuria.Some foods especially the highly allergic ones may participate in the pathogenesis and progression of IgA nephropathy.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670462","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Food allergy","weight":0.777624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_allergy"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.579468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.325848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"IgA nephropathy","weight":0.202778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgA_nephropathy"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.100556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Sandwich","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
