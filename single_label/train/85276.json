{"id":85276,"title":"Periostin is required for maximal airways inflammation andÂ hyperresponsiveness in mice.","abstract":"Periostin, a secreted extracellular matrix protein, has been localized to deposits of subepithelial fibrosis in asthmatic patients, and periostin levels have been linked to increases in IL-13.We hypothesized that periostin is required for airway inflammatory responses to a physiologic aeroallergen, house dust mite (HDM).We studied F4-F6 B6;129-Postn(tm1Jmol)/J wild-type (Postn(+/+)) and null (Postn(-/-)) mice, as well as C57BL/6 mice treated with either IgM or OC-20 periostin neutralizing antibody. Mice were exposed to 5 doses of HDM intranasally over a 16-day period.HDM increased airways responsiveness in Postn(+/+) but not Postn(-/-) mice. In addition, HDM-treated C57BL/6 mice injected with OC-20 had lower airways responsiveness than HDM-treated mice injected with IgM. Compared with Postn(+/+) mice, Postn(-/-) mice showed decreases in HDM-induced inflammation and mucous metaplasia, as well as reduced IL-4, IL-25, CD68, Gob5, and periostin mRNA expression. OC-20 antibody produced similar results. HDM exposure increased periostin expression in the airway epithelium, subepithelium, smooth muscle and inflammatory cells. OC-20 blocked the HDM-induced IgE response, and T cells incubated with dendritic cells (DCs) from Postn(-/-) mice or treated with OC-20 showed deficient DNA synthesis and IL-13 responses compared with T cells incubated with wild-type DCs. Finally, adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived DCs from Postn(+/+) mice was sufficient to promote allergic responses in F6 Postn(-/-) littermates.In mice, periostin is required for maximal airways hyperresponsiveness and inflammation after HDM sensitization and challenge. Periostin is required for maximal HDM-induced T-cell responses.","date":"2014-12-08","categories":"Respiratory Tract
