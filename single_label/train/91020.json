{"id":91020,"title":"Polish adaptation and validation of burn specific health scale - brief.","abstract":"The Burn Specific Health Scale - Brief is a well-described, specific tool to assess health condition (quality of life) of burnt patients. This project was aimed at creating a Polish adaptation and validation of the Burn Specific Health Scale - Brief.Adaptation of the tool was performed in two stages. The first stage involved translation, back translation, evaluation by a panel of judges and a pre-test of the tool. The second stage consisted of surveying 202 burned patients. Those data were used to conduct a psychometric analysis. Reliability was checked by determining the Cronbach's ? internal consistency coefficient and conducting the test-retest procedure (ICC). Content validity was evaluated by a panel of judges. Criterion validity was determined using SF-36. Construct validity was determined using known-groups validation.Reliability of the tool, determined using the internal consistency coefficient (Cronbach's ?=0.94) and the test-retest procedure (ICC=0.89), proved to be high. Criterion validity, determined using the relationship of results of comparable BSHS-B and SF-36 subscales, obtained a satisfactory level with a correlation of r=0.55-0.89 (p<0.01). Analysis of inter-group differences showed that patients who stayed at a hospital for more than 10 days (p=0.002), patients after surgical intervention (p=0.018), patients with a burn larger than 19% of the TBSA (p=0.01) and patients with 3rd degree burns (p=0.001) have much poorer results than the rest of the subjects.The Polish version of BSHS-B is a reliable and valid tool for assessing quality of life of burned patients. It may be used to plan the burn treatment process and evaluate its outcomes.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556075","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.253154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.239606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.187896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.140035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.0389337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0303278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Content validity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_validity"},{"name":"Criterion validity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_validity"},{"name":"Back translation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_translation"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.0293966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Construct validity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_validity"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Polish language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Conducting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Rmdir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rmdir"},{"name":"International Cricket Council","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"},{"name":"Multistage rocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"The Criterion Collection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Criterion_Collection"},{"name":"Winning percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Intergroups in the European Parliament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergroups_in_the_European_Parliament"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Committee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Construct (comics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_(comics)"}]}
