{"id":52495,"title":"Role of luteal phase support on gonadotropin ovulation induction cycles in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of luteal phase progesterone support on pregnancy rates in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who were treated for clomiphene citrate-resistant anovulatory infertility with ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination (OI/ IUI).This randomized study included 110 clomiphene citrate-resistant PCOS patients. All patients underwent ovulation induction with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone and intrauterine insemination, up to 3 cycles, and were randomized into 2 groups: (1) luteal support with progesterone or (2) a control group. The main outcomes were clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates per cycle.Demographic data were not different between the study and control groups. Cycle characteristics were found to be homogeneous between groups. A total of 38 pregnancies were achieved (15.5% pregnancy rate per cycle). The clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate per cycle in progesterone supported cycles were 18.9% and 16.8%, respectively.There might be a clinical benefit of luteal progesterone supplementation on OI/IUI cycles for women with PCOS. Although we did not reach a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups, luteal-supported cycles demonstrated a 6.7% higher clinical pregnancy rate and 6.1% higher live birth rate.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597283","annotations":[{"name":"Artificial insemination","weight":0.876215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination"},{"name":"Progesterone","weight":0.859481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone"},{"name":"Ovulation","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.822923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Luteal phase","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteal_phase"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Insemination","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insemination"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Anovulation","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anovulation"},{"name":"Clomifene","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomifene"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.758506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Corpus luteum","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_luteum"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.699907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.688108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.614344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Ovulation induction","weight":0.501824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation_induction"},{"name":"Birth rate","weight":0.291842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.124674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Ovoviviparity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovoviviparity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
