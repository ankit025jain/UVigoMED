{"id":14860,"title":"Inhibition of 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene-induced contact hypersensitivity reaction by antidepressant drugs.","abstract":"Contact hypersensitivity (CHS) induced by a topical application of hapten - 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), is a T cytotoxic (Tc)1-cell-mediated antigen-specific type of skin inflammation. Recently, it has been shown that antidepressant drugs inhibit the T helper (Th)1-mediated CHS reaction induced by picryl chloride. The aim of present study was to establish the effect of two-week desipramine or fluoxetine administration on the CHS reaction induced by DNFB.Balb/c (H-2(d)) male mice were divided into six groups: 1) vehicle-treated negative control group; 2) desipramine-treated negative control group; 3) fluoxetine-treated negative control group; 4) vehicle-treated DNFB group (positive control group); 5) desipramine-treated DNFB group; 6) fluoxetine-treated DNFB group. T lymphocytes proliferation was determined by incorporation of [(3)H]-thymidine to DNA of concanavalin A stimulated cells. ELISA test was used for estimation of cytokines production.The antidepressants significantly suppressed the CHS reaction mediated by Tc1 cells: desipramine by 55% and fluoxetine by 54% compared to the positive control. Moreover, the antidepressants decreased the proliferative activity of splenocytes and the ability of splenocytes to produce interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-? and increased IL-10 production by the lymph node (LN) cells of DNFB-treated mice.The results of the present study show that the Tc1-dependent reactivity to DNFB is significantly suppressed by antidepressant drugs, which suggests their inhibitory effect on Tc1 mediated immunity.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24399719","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.903277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.901493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Fluoxetine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoxetine"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.882746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Concanavalin A","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concanavalin_A"},{"name":"Hapten","weight":0.826718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapten"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.772433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.766623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.652619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.649237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.612652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Technetium","weight":0.308509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.289455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Desipramine","weight":0.143968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desipramine"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"}]}
