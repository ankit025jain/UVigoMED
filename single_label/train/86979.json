{"id":86979,"title":"[Study on the B cell linear epitopes of rabies virus CVS-11 nucleoprotein].","abstract":"To study the B cell linear epitopes of rabies virus CVS-11 nucleoprotein, peptides were synthesized according to the amino acid sequences of B cell linear epitopes. Linear epitopes predicted by bioinformatics analysis were evaluated with immunological techniques. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that titers of antibodies to peptides (355-369 and 385-400 residues of rabies virus CVS-11 nucleoprotein) were above 1:12 800 in mouse sera. The antibodies recognized denatured rabies virus CVS-11 nucleoprotein in Western blot analysis. Purified anti-peptide antibodies recognized natural rabies virus CVS-11 nucleoprotein in BHK-21 cells in indirect fluorescent antibody test. The 355-369 and 385-400 residues of rabies virus CVS-11 nucleoprotein were validated as B cell linear epitopes.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25118379","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Nucleoprotein","weight":0.712431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoprotein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Denaturation (biochemistry)","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denaturation_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Peptide sequence","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_sequence"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.55997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.4935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Rabies","weight":0.328449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.23274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
