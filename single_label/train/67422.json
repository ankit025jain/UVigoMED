{"id":67422,"title":"[Efficacy impacts of the different treatment frequencies on female stress urinary incontinence].","abstract":"To observe the effect on female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) treated with the pudendal nerve stimulation of electroacupuncture therapy at different frequencies.Sixty patients were divided into a group treated three times every week (group A) and a group treated twice every week (group B), 30 cases in each one. The pudendal nerve stimulation of electroacupuncture therapy was adopted at Disixue (four acupoints on sacral region), 60 min in each time in the two groups, treated three times a week or twice a week respectively. SUI severity and the score of life quality were observed before and after 12 treatments separately. The efficacy was evaluated in the two groups.At the end of treatment, SUI severity was relieved and the score of life quality was improved in the two groups (all P<0.01). The results in group A were superior to group B [0 (0-4.3) vs 4 (0-5), P<0.01]. At the end of treatment, the total effective rate in group A was 90.0% (27/30) and was 76.7% (23/30) in group B; the efficacy in group A was better than that in group B (P<0.05).The pudendal nerve stimulation of electroacupuncture therapy achieves the definite efficacy on female SUI and the results in the treatment of three times a week are superior to those in the treatment of twice a week.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617234","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.735353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Pudendal nerve","weight":0.351112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pudendal_nerve"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.316419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.315682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.264981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Electroacupuncture","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroacupuncture"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.186179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.176132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.167876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.142562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
