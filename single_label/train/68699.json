{"id":68699,"title":"Prevalence and related risk factors of albuminuria in Korean adults: the 2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.","abstract":"Albuminuria is known to be associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality even in the general population. We aimed at investigating the prevalence and related risk factors of albuminuria among Korean adults.This study was based on data collected during the 2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A total of 5,365 Korean adults were included in the general population group, and 3,282 of these participants were included in the nondiabetic, nonhypertensive population group. Albuminuria was defined by a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio value within the range of 3.4-34 mg/mmol (30-300 Âµg/mg).The overall prevalence of albuminuria was 5.2% of the general population and 2.1% of the nondiabetic, nonhypertensive population. Factors associated with the risk of albuminuria in the general population were age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level in men, and SBP and HbA1c level in women. In the nondiabetic, nonhypertensive population, age and fasting plasma glucose levels were significantly associated with an increased risk for albuminuria in men, and with central obesity, triglyceride level and smoking status in women.Albuminuria is prevalent in the nondiabetic, nonhypertensive population as well as general population of Korea. The increased risk of albuminuria was independently associated with several cardiovascular risk factors in the general population, and also in the nondiabetic, nonhypertensive population.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503631","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Abdominal obesity","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.79342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.757715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.638467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Albuminuria","weight":0.291689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuminuria"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.224882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Nutrition_Examination_Survey"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"}]}
