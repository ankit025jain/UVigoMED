{"id":29911,"title":"Implicit motive profile of treatment-seeking opiate users: high affiliation and low achievement.","abstract":"Research on basic human motives (achievement, affiliation, and power) encoded at the emotional level recently returned to the forefront of scientific research. To date, there are only a few studies on the pattern of implicit motives of substance users, so the present study examined opiate users participating in methadone maintenance treatment (N = 80) along these dimensions, comparing them to 40 non-substance users. Participants were asked to create stories on the basis of the pictures of the Thematic Apperception Test. The stories were analyzed using the content analysis method of David Winter (1991). Like other substance user groups, opiate-dependent persons used less achievement and more affiliation notions in creating stories, while there was no significant difference between the two groups concerning power notions. The results proved to be independent of the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms, despite substance users reporting higher levels of these, and suggest that motivational factors are worth considering in treatment planning.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592662","annotations":[{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Opiate","weight":0.784796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiate"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.778361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.709945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.453863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Content analysis","weight":0.369643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_analysis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Methadone","weight":0.19889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Storytelling","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling"},{"name":"Thematic Apperception Test","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_Apperception_Test"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0562587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"David","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Winter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter"},{"name":"1991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"User (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)"},{"name":"Methadone maintenance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone_maintenance"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Implicit memory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_memory"},{"name":"Apperception","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apperception"}]}
