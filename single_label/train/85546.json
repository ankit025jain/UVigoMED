{"id":85546,"title":"Accumulation of BDCA1? dendritic cells in interstitial fibrotic lung diseases and Th2-high asthma.","abstract":"Dendritic cells (DCs) significantly contribute to the pathology of several mouse lung disease models. However, little is known of the contribution of DCs to human lung diseases. In this study, we examined infiltration with BDCA1? DCs of human lungs in patients with interstitial lung diseases or asthma. Using flow cytometry, we found that these DCs increased by 5?6 fold in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which are both characterized by extensive fibrosis in parenchyma. The same DC subset also significantly increased in the lung parenchyma of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, although the degree of increase was relatively modest. By employing immunofluorescence microscopy using Fc?RI and MHCII as the specific markers for BDCA1? DCs, we found that the numbers of BDCA1? DCs also significantly increased in the airway epithelium of Th2 inflammation-associated asthma. These findings suggest a potential contribution of BDCA1? DCs in human lung diseases associated with interstitial fibrosis or Th2 airway inflammation.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24915147","annotations":[{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.915556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis","weight":0.797944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity_pneumonitis"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.785671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.590117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.569549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.536161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.412183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.408977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Pneumonitis","weight":0.0554529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonitis"},{"name":"Human lung","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_lung"},{"name":"Respiratory epithelium","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_epithelium"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"}]}
