{"id":54304,"title":"Thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies are associated with a lesser likelihood of late reversion to hyperthyroidism after successful non-ablative treatment of Graves' disease in Croatian patients.","abstract":"Thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPOAbs) are frequently observed in Graves' disease (GD) and tend to persist in patients even after successful treatment with antithyroid drugs. However, there is a lack of consistent data regarding the prognostic significance of TPOAbs during and after non-ablative treatment for Graves' hyperthyroidism.To assess the prognostic value of TPOAbs on the long-term outcome of GD patients, who were in remission after the use of antithyroid drugs (block-and-replace regimen).100 remitters were retrospectively investigated for factors associated with the 5-year course of disease recurrence and compared to 60 age/sex-matched patients with intractable GD.Mild hyperthyroidism, low baseline thyroid-stimulating antibodies levels, and small goiters were predictive of remission. Once attained, the remission was shorter in younger patients, patients with declining post-treatment TSH values, and negative baseline TPOAb levels. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse incrementally increased from 24 to 44 to 70 % across decreasing TPOAb tertiles (log-rank, p = 0.00056; the lower tertile representing TPOAb-negative cases). The age-of-onset (p = 0.034), and the baseline TPOAb value [upper tertile, hazard ratio (HR) 0.25; 95 % confidence interval, 0.11-0.59; p = 0.0014; middle tertile, HR 0.47 (0.24-0.9); p = 0.024; Cox regression] were inversely associated with late (>12 months) relapse rates in a level-dependent manner. In contrast, serum logTSH measured 6 months after drug discontinuation was inversely associated with hazard rates at all time points (p = 0.0005).Baseline TPOAb positivity is an independent indicator of long-term remission in GD patients who have been successfully treated, but the mechanism of action and causal relations remain unknown.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Endocrine System
