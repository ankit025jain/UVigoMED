{"id":34615,"title":"Complications of native arteriovenous fistula: the role of color Doppler ultrasonography.","abstract":"Color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS) is a readily available, inexpensive and noninvasive method, which has improved the survival of native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) by increasing the early diagnosis of complications. Although angiography has been currently considered as the gold standard for imaging of vascular access abnormalities, CDUS may be superior in some aspects, since it provides information both on the morphology and on the function of vascular access and it is the only tool directly available to the nephrologist. In addition, CDUS offers the advantage of a non-invasive bedside procedure with lower costs and with no need for radiocontrast.
