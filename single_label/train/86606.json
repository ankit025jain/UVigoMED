This study aims to observe the effects of TCF21 on the proliferation, apoptosis and migration of A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells.TCF21 was overexpressed in A549 cells via lentiviral transfection. Fluorescence-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were used to analyze the expression of the target gene. Transwell, proliferation assay, and flow cytometry were applied to detect the effect of TCF21 overexpression on the migration, proliferation, and apoptosis of A549 cells after transfection.The proliferation and migration of A549 cells were inhibited, and the apoptotic rate was increased by overexpressing TCF21.The tumor suppressor gene, TCF21, significantly inhibits the proliferation and migration, as well as facilitates early apoptosis of A549 cells.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758904","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Epistasis","weight":0.666711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Lentivirus","weight":0.638424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentivirus"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.631704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.421785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.333977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Human lung","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_lung"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
