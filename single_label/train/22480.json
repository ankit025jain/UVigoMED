{"id":22480,"title":"A review of factors that affect transmission and survival of verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli in the European farm to fork beef chain.","abstract":"Verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) are a significant foodborne public health hazard in Europe, where most human infections are associated with six serogroups (O157, O26, O103, O145, O111 and O104). With the exception of O104, these serogroups are associated with bovine animals and beef products. This paper reviews our current knowledge of VTEC in the beef chain focusing on transmission and the factors which impact on survival from the farm through transport, lairage, slaughter, dressing, processing and distribution, in the context of the European beef industry. It provides new information on beef farm and animal hide prevalence, distribution and virulence factors as well as pre-chilled carcass and ground beef prevalence, generated by the recently completed EU Framework research project, ProSafeBeef. In the concluding section, emerging issues and data gaps are addressed with a view to increasing our understanding of this pathogen and developing new thinking on detection and control.
