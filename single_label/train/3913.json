{"id":3913,"title":"The evolution of breast imaging: past to present.","abstract":"The practice of breast imaging has transitioned through a wide variety of technologic advances from the early days of direct-exposure film mammography to xeromammography to screen-film mammography to the current era of full-field digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis. Along with these technologic advances, organized screening, federal regulations based on the Mammography Quality Standards Act, and the development of the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System have helped to shape the specialty of breast imaging. With the development of breast ultrasonography and breast magnetic resonance imaging, both complementary to mammography, additional algorithms for diagnostic workup and screening high-risk subgroups of women have emerged. A substantial part of breast imaging practice these days also involves breast interventional procedures-both percutaneous biopsy to obtain tissue diagnosis and localization procedures to guide surgical excision. This article reviews the evolution of breast imaging starting from a historical perspective and progressing to the present day.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25340437","annotations":[{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.835601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Digital mammography","weight":0.792838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mammography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.654701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.59798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.57535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"BI-RADS","weight":0.397149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BI-RADS"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.299266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.292974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"American College of Radiology","weight":0.244444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Radiology"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mammography Quality Standards Act","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography_Quality_Standards_Act"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.140191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Tomosynthesis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomosynthesis"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Federal government of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Digital photography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_photography"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Act of Parliament","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
