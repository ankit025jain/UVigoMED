{"id":33774,"title":"Vitamin D status and adequacy of standard supplementation in preterm neonates from South India.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess vitamin D status of preterm babies at birth and adequacy of daily supplementation with vitamin D.This prospective cohort study recruited 111 preterm babies, 25 to 32 weeks' gestation from a tertiary care perinatal center in south India. Cord blood was assayed for serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). All of the babies were fed unfortified breast-milk and supplemented daily with calcium, phosphate, and 400 IU of vitamin D. At 6 weeks serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, and 25(OH)D levels were estimated.Of 111 preterm babies recruited, a total of 90 (81%) of the preterm babies were followed up until 6 weeks. The median (interquartile range) vitamin D level in the preterm group was 34.7 (25.6-50.1) and 19.3 (13.9-27.1) ng/mL at birth and 6 weeks, respectively. Using a cutoff value of <20 ng/mL to determine vitamin D insufficiency (VDI), it was observed that 12.6% of the babies were vitamin D insufficient at birth. This increased to 52.2% at 6 weeks despite the recommended supplementation with vitamin D (P < 0.001).The prevalence of VDI was not high at birth; however, a large proportion of preterm babies were vitamin D insufficient at 6 weeks despite being supplemented with vitamin D 400 IU/day. The recommended vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU appears to be inadequate to prevent VDI, and hence randomized controlled trials looking at higher doses of vitamin D supplementation are needed.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792631","annotations":[{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.85705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.847232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Human breast milk","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_breast_milk"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.778452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.732987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"India","weight":0.693687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.687908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.685161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.675808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.238135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.0862714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Cord blood","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_blood"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.0266043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"}]}
