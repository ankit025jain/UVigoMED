{"id":3865,"title":"[The biochemical markers in diagnostic of neuroendocrine tumors].","abstract":"The review considers common concepts of neuroendocrine tumors. The results of original studies of biochemical markers of this type of tumor are presented. The various clinical symptoms and syndromes related to hyper-production of biologically active compounds are described. The characteristic of the most important biochemical markers in diagnostic and monitoring of effectiveness of treatment of neuroendocrine tumors is given.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25346980","annotations":[{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.69084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.654701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Biomarker (medicine)","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"}]}
