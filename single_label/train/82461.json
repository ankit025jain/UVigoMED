{"id":82461,"title":"[Rare giant salivary gland pleomorphic adenoma on the neck].","abstract":"The patient has found his neck mass for more than 30 years, and the neck mass has slowly growed into giant tumor. Five days ago, the neck giant mass suddenly burst, hemorrhage and overflow liquid. The giant mass with irregular in shape, surface uneven, skin highly tension and superficial venous engorgement, was seen in left lateral neck. CT scan demonstrates a mixture of solid, cystic and lobulated mass shadow within subcutaneous fat spaces of left lateral neck. Postoperative pathological examination proved that it is salivary gland pleomorphic adenoma.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620671","annotations":[{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.761904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.745489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.655988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.548361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.24672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Pleomorphic adenoma","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphic_adenoma"},{"name":"Pleomorphism","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphism"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Arithmetic overflow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_overflow"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Rare Ltd.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Ltd."},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Shadow","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow"},{"name":"Engorgement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engorgement"}]}
