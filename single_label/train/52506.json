{"id":52506,"title":"Spinal cord stimulation for intractable chronic pain.","abstract":"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is minimally invasive and reversible therapy for treatment of severe, otherwise nonresponsive chronic pain. Such approach is relatively safe, with very few side-effects, not addictive, and provides enduring therapeutic response. A number of clinical studies support the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation in treating failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome, as well as peripheral neuropathic pain, postamputation pain, postherpetic neuralgia, root and spinal cord injury pain. In addition, neurostimulation has been used to treat refractory angina, chronic abdominal pain, peripheral vascular disease, and vaso-occlusive syndromes. Clinical use of spinal cord stimulation is expanding at very fast pace, and new technological modalities in SCS will provide a new clinical evidence with likely better pain control.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595705","annotations":[{"name":"Peripheral vascular disease","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vascular_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complex regional pain syndrome","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_regional_pain_syndrome"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Angina pectoris","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.776736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.771067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.736389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Neuropathic pain","weight":0.710199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathic_pain"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Neuralgia","weight":0.663288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralgia"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.616243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.55997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.558188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Spinal cord stimulator","weight":0.351152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_stimulator"},{"name":"Laminectomy","weight":0.34271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminectomy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.276491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Postherpetic neuralgia","weight":0.275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postherpetic_neuralgia"},{"name":"Failed back syndrome","weight":0.150256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_back_syndrome"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
