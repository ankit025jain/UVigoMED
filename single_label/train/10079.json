{"id":10079,"title":"Mechanisms of dopamine D1 receptor-mediated ERK1/2 activation in the parkinsonian striatum and their modulation by metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5.","abstract":"In animal models of Parkinson's disease, striatal overactivation of ERK1/2 via dopamine (DA) D1 receptors is the hallmark of a supersensitive molecular response associated with dyskinetic behaviors. Here we investigate the pathways involved in D1 receptor-dependent ERK1/2 activation using acute striatal slices from rodents with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions. Application of the dopamine D1-like receptor agonist SKF38393 induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and downstream signaling in the DA-denervated but not the intact striatum. This response was mediated through a canonical D1R/PKA/MEK1/2 pathway and independent of ionotropic glutamate receptors but blocked by antagonists of L-type calcium channels. Coapplication of an antagonist of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5) or its downstream signaling molecules (PLC, PKC, IP3 receptors) markedly attenuated SKF38393-induced ERK1/2 activation. The role of striatal mGluR5 in D1-dependent ERK1/2 activation was confirmed in vivo in 6-OHDA-lesioned animals treated systemically with SKF38393. In one experiment, local infusion of the mGluR5 antagonist MTEP in the DA-denervated rat striatum attenuated the activation of ERK1/2 signaling by SKF38393. In another experiment, 6-OHDA lesions were applied to transgenic mice with a cell-specific knockdown of mGluR5 in D1 receptor-expressing neurons. These mice showed a blunted striatal ERK1/2 activation in response to SFK38393 treatment. Our results reveal that D1-dependent ERK1/2 activation in the DA-denervated striatum depends on a complex interaction between PKA- and Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathways that is critically modulated by striatal mGluR5.
