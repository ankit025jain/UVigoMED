{"id":79396,"title":"Cellular changes in tears associated with keratoconjunctival responses induced by nasal allergy.","abstract":"Allergic keratoconjunctivitis occurs in a primary form, caused by an allergic reaction localized in the conjunctiva, and in a secondary form, induced by an allergic reaction originating in the nasal mucosa. Various hypersensitivity mechanisms involved in the keratoconjunctivitis forms result in different keratoconjunctival response types.To investigate the cytologic changes in tears during the secondary immediate (SIKCR), late (SLKCR), and delayed (SDYKCR) keratoconjunctival responses.In 61 patients, comprising 20 SIKCRs, 23 SLKCRs, and 18 SDYKCRs, nasal provocation tests (NPTs) with allergens and 61 phosphate-buffered control challenges were repeated and supplemented with cell counting in the tears.The SIKCR (P<0.01), appearing 10-120 min after the NPT, was associated with increased eosinophil and mast cell counts in tears. The SLKCR (P<0.01), appearing 5-12 h after the NPT, was accompanied by increased counts of eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils, and conjunctival epithelial and goblet cells. The SDYKCR (P<0.05), appearing 24-48 h after NPT, was associated with increased counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, conjunctival epithelial, corneal epithelial and goblet cells.The SIKCR, SLKCR, and SDYKCR, induced by nasal allergy, were associated with different cellular profiles in the tears. The cells, except mast, epithelial and goblet cells, displaying no intracellular changes, migrated probably from the conjunctival capillaries, in response to the factors released during the primary allergic reaction in the nasal mucosa and subsequently penetrating into the conjunctiva. These results demonstrate a causal role of nasal allergy and diagnostic value of NPT combined with recording of ocular features and cellular profiles in tears in some keratoconjunctivitis patients.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434662","annotations":[{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Mast cell","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.842079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Basophil granulocyte","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Goblet cell","weight":0.773455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblet_cell"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.701629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.57819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cytopathology","weight":0.318918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopathology"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis","weight":0.224907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis"},{"name":"Corneal epithelium","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_epithelium"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"}]}
