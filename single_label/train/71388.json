{"id":71388,"title":"Silencing of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C ? remodulates the expression of the phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway in human osteosarcoma cell lines.","abstract":"Ezrin, a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin family, is involved in the metastatic spread of osteosarcoma. Ezrin binds phosphatydil inositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a crucial molecule of the phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway. PIP2 levels are regulated by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) enzymes. PI-PLC? isoform, a well-characterized direct effector of rat sarcoma (RAS), is at a unique convergence point for the broad range of signaling pathways that promote RAS GTPase-mediated signalling.By using molecular biology methods and microscopic analyses, we analyzed the expression of ezrin and PLC genes after silencing of PLCE (OMIM *608414) in 143B and Hs888 cell lines.The growth rate of the cells was slowed, and the expression of ezrin, PLCB1, PLCG2 and PLCD4 was significantly modified. Ezrin displacement from the plasma membrane was observed.The present results corroborate the hypothesis that ezrin and the PI signal transduction system are involved in a common network.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075031","annotations":[{"name":"Phospholipase C","weight":0.904339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_C"},{"name":"PLCB1","weight":0.852349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLCB1"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.760749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.758035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"},{"name":"Inositol","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.743986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol_4,5-bisphosphate"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"PLCG2","weight":0.702422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLCG2"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.687537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"PLCD4","weight":0.678936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLCD4"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.630405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.624818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.604676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Phosphoinositide","weight":0.599181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoinositide"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.59441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.469679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.457443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.361956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.250837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.224458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Mendelian_Inheritance_in_Man"},{"name":"Ezrin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezrin"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Convergent evolution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
