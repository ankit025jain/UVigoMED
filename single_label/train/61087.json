{"id":61087,"title":"[Application of lenalidomide in chronic lymphocytic leukemia].","abstract":"In recent years, the incidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is increasing. Microenvironment and immune system play a key role in the pathogenesis of CLL. The immune system is aggravated by the use of chemotherapeutic agents, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with rituximab(FCR) which are the current standards in frontline therapy. This leads to an increase of infection incidence in patients, resulting in a poor prognosis. The present situation was changed by lenalidomide. Recent studies indicated that lenalidomide monotherapy in treatment of refractory or relapsed CLL patients, the overall response rate(ORR) reached about 32%-47%, CR roughly was 7%-13%; when lenalidomide and rituximab were combined for treatment of refractory or relapsed CLL patients, the ORR reached about 53%-66%, CR about 12%-13%. Moreover, when lenalidomide and ofatumumab were combined, the efficacy is improved significantly and the adverse reactions are greatly reduced. The adverse reactions are neutrophilic granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, tumor lysis syndrome(TLS), tumor flare reaction(TFR) and venous thromboembolism(VTE). This review focuses on the related studies and the latest progress about lenalidomide in CLL.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763044","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Granulocytopenia","weight":0.902813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocytopenia"},{"name":"Lenalidomide","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenalidomide"},{"name":"Fludarabine","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludarabine"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.726414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.439645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Ofatumumab","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofatumumab"}]}
