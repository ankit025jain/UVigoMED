{"id":90290,"title":"Diagnosis of metacarpal fracture with equivocal x-ray by point-of-care ultrasound: a case report.","abstract":"Metacarpal fractures represent a very common injury among patients presenting to the emergency department. Diagnosis is of utmost importance given the high morbidity associated with lack of full hand function. We report a case of a 37-year-old man who sustained extremity trauma after a mechanical fall. He presented with an examination that revealed diffuse tenderness over the wrist and hand. X-ray of the hand was equivocal for a metacarpal fracture; however, point-of-care ultrasound revealed disruption of the bony cortex confirming the diagnosis. The patient was splinted and referred for follow-up with a hand specialist. Point-of-care ultrasound may be useful for the diagnosis of hand fractures, which may reduce health care costs and radiation exposure in the future.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630805","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.792177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.775768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.576605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.5758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.548177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.474758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.330914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.261224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.132046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Cortical bone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_bone"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Metacarpus","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpus"},{"name":"Shoulder problem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_problem"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"}]}
