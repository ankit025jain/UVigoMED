{"id":26810,"title":"Echocardiography for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","abstract":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of phenotypic expression, in the absence of another systemic or cardiac disease causing increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, is estimated to be 1:500. The frequency of clinical presentation is far less, highlighting the need for a non-invasive diagnostic imaging tool. Echocardiography is readily available and allows for structural characterization and hemodynamic assessment of the hypertrophic heart and to screen patients at-risk for HCM, such as first degree relatives of affected individuals, and differentiate HCM from the athletic heart. Echocardiography can also be used to assess for anatomic abnormalities of the mitral valve apparatus that may exacerbate LV outflow track obstruction and to further risk stratify patients during exercise. Finally, echocardiography plays an integral role in guiding alcohol septal ablation procedures.
