{"id":56832,"title":"Epithelial remodeling after femtosecond laser-assisted high myopic LASIK: comparison of stand-alone with LASIK combined with prophylactic high-fluence cross-linking.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible topographic epithelial profile thickness changes (remodeling) after high myopic femtosecond laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) with concurrent prophylactic high-fluence cross-linking (CXL) in comparison with standard femtosecond LASIK.Preoperative and 6-month postoperative 3-dimensional epithelial thickness distribution maps were investigated through clinical spectral domain anterior-segment optical coherence tomography in 2 groups of femtosecond laser-assisted myopic LASIK cases. Group A represented 67 eyes treated additionally with concurrent prophylactic CXL (LASIK-Xtra); group B represented 72 eyes subjected to stand-alone femtosecond LASIK. Optical coherence tomography measurements of the epithelial thickness over the center 2-mm-diameter disk, mid-peripheral 5-mm rim, and overall (the entire 6-mm-diameter disc area) were investigated.The comparison of matched myopic correction subgroups indicated statistically significant differences in the epithelial thickness increase specifically between high myopia subgroups. For example, in group A (LASIK-Xtra), the mid-peripheral epithelial thickness increase was +3.79 and +3.95 ?m for the \"-8.00 to -9.00 diopter\" and \"-7.00 to -8.00 diopter\" subgroups, which compare with increased thickness in group B (stand-alone LASIK), of +9.75 ?m (P = 0.032) and +7.14 ?m (P = 0.041), respectively, for the same subgroups.Application of prophylactic CXL concurrently with high myopic LASIK operation results in a statistically significant reduced epithelial increase in comparison with stand-alone LASIK. This comparison is observed between matched high myopic correction subgroups. This difference may correlate with higher regression rates and/or may depict increased biomechanical instability in stand-alone LASIK.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622298","annotations":[{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.861554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.84303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.734825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.610903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.432493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.327918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.316895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.269585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.131144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.0558118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Keratomileusis","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratomileusis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Hard disk drive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Renovation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"}]}
