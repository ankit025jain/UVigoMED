{"id":90071,"title":"[Treatment of radial neck fracture in children with elastic stable intramedullary nails].","abstract":"To investigate effects of elastic stable intramedullary nails for the treatment of radial neck fracture in children.From July 2006 to December 2011, 25 children with radical neck fractures, which included 16 males and 9 females aged from 7 to 15 years old (means 10.7), were treated with elastic stable intramedullary nails. According to Judet classification, 6 cases were type II, 17 cases were type III and 2 cases were type IV (including 1 case with type IVa and 1 case with type IVb). The fracture healing, pain, deformity and range of motion of elbow were recorded.All patients were followed up for 6 to 24 months with an average of 14 months. Twenty-five patients were obtained bone healing. According to Tibone and Stoltz evaluation standard, 18 cases got excellet results, 4 cases in good and 3 cases in moderate.Elastic stable intramedullary nails for the treatment of radial neck fracture in children has advantages of simple operation,less trauma and good results.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654520","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.657446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.458871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.368095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Osteogenesis imperfecta","weight":0.304115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.28412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.253016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Cervical fracture","weight":0.20453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_fracture"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.173963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.103897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}]}
