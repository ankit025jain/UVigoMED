{"id":43091,"title":"Gene expression profiling of immune responsive and fibrosis genes in hepatitis C virus infected patients.","abstract":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a dreadful viral disease, responsible for 170 million cases worldwide, of which most are from Asia and Africa and approximately 10 million people are from Pakistan. Currently, the pegylated interferon alpha (PEG-INF-?) has been approved as the standard of care in combination with ribavirin and Boceprevir/Telaprevir. Many studies regarding gene expression analysis of liver biopsy samples of patients with chronic HCV infection have been carried out previously. However, there are very few reports of expression analysis carried out using blood samples of HCV patients. Therefore, in this study, gene expression of human immune responsive genes (MMP-9, OAS1) and fibrogenic responsive gene (KRT19) was done in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of chronic HCV infected patients having differences in viral titers. Blood samples were collected from different hospitals in Pakistan. RNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesized according to the protocol prescribed by the Enzynomics™ M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase(®) Kit. The synthesized cDNA was amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers of immune responsive genes. The results were further evaluated using real-time PCR. There was a significant increase in the expression of the immune responsive genes (MMP-9, OAS1, CXCL6, CXCR3, ApoA1, and MYC) of HCV genotype 3a patients compared to controls. Similarly, the expression of the fibrosis genes was upregulated in HCV genotype 3a patients compared to controls. The information gained through this study is helpful to identify a noninvasive marker to determine liver fibrosis, and may also give useful information to understand HCV pathogenesis and develop better therapeutic regimens.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System
