{"id":19295,"title":"Development of a FTIR-ATR based model for typing clinically relevant Acinetobacter baumannii clones belonging to ST98, ST103, ST208 and ST218.","abstract":"In this work we developed and validated a FTIR-ATR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance) based model for typing Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates belonging to ST98, ST208 and ST218 included into the worldwide spread clonal complex (CC) 92 and ST103. FTIR-ATR spectra of seventy-seven previously characterized isolates (Multi Locus Sequence Type-MLST, Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis-PFGE and carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D ?-lactamase-CHDL) were acquired and modeled by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA). The model was tested and successfully validated with a diverse collection of isolates (n=148) recovered from different countries and periods of time belonging to modeled and non-modeled STs.
