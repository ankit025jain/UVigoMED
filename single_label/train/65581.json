{"id":65581,"title":"Functionalized gold nanorods for thermal ablation treatment of bladder cancer.","abstract":"Nanomaterial-directed, photothermal ablation is a practical future approach for the treatment of early-stage bladder cancer. Using a new PEGylation technique with bi-functional nitrophenyl carbonate PEG (bi-NPC-PEG) that promotes uniform suspension of the nanomaterial in solution, we have shown that gold nanorods conjugated to an anti-EGFR antibody (nano-alphaEGFR) bind effectively to EGFR-expressing bladder cancer cells. The subsequent application of infrared light, specifically tuned to the plasmon resonance of the nanorods used in this work, allows for the specific heating of nano-alphaEGFR to the point of localized cellular death. Such an approach, administering nano-alphaEGFR intravesically via a urinary catheter and infrared light via a modified cystoscope, represents a novel, future clinical application of this technology, which avoids the problem of systemic exposure and clearance of nanoparticles from body.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804547","annotations":[{"name":"Nanomaterials","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomaterials"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.727111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.665289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.632117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.4935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.45983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Cystoscopy","weight":0.391086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystoscopy"},{"name":"Plasmon","weight":0.369643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmon"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.341109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.339074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.334742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Carbonate","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.241581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.208802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Polyethylene glycol","weight":0.199263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.156268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Urinary catheterization","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_catheterization"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Nanorod","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanorod"},{"name":"Surface plasmon resonance","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_plasmon_resonance"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"Joule heating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_heating"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0126805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"}]}
