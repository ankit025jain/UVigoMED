{"id":78128,"title":"Middle fossa vestibular neurectomy for refractory vertigo: less is more.","abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate outcomes of the middle fossa (MF) superior vestibular neurectomy in unilateral Ménière's disease.Case series with preoperative and postoperative analysis of the 1995 American Academy of Otolaryngology hearing stage and vertigo class, gait instability, and results of vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP).Four out of the 5 patients had total vertigo control (class A) and 1 had near total control (class B) by the last visit (mean follow-up, 23.6 months). There were no changes in hearing thresholds and hearing stage. Four patients had resolution of their gait instability by 2 months after surgery. Postoperative VEMP responses were preserved in all 3 patients with positive VEMP preoperatively.This is the first report of the anatomical and functional preservation of the inferior vestibular nerve in vestibular neurectomy for the treatment of refractory vertigo in unilateral Ménière's disease, with VEMP testing before and after vestibular neurectomy. The modified technique limits the surgical dissection and may help avoid complications such as postoperative hearing loss and persistent gait instability. This approach is indicated when other more conservative measures have failed, and patient selection is paramount to avoid long-term complications.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769882","annotations":[{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.761137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.550097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.482396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.339322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.244346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.208234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Vestibular nerve","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_nerve"},{"name":"Neurectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurectomy"},{"name":"American Academy of Otolaryngology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Food preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_preservation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Midfielder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"List of North American broadcast station classes","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes"},{"name":"Myogenic contraction","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myogenic_contraction"},{"name":"Minimalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"},{"name":"Middle cranial fossa","weight":0.010864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cranial_fossa"}]}
