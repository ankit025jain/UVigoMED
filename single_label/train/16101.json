{"id":16101,"title":"Baicalin prevents Candida albicans infections via increasing its apoptosis rate.","abstract":"These experiments were employed to explore the mechanisms underlying baicalin action on Candida albicans.We detected the baicalin inhibition effects on three isotope-labeled precursors of (3)H-UdR, (3)H-TdR and (3)H-leucine incorporation into C. albicans using the isotope incorporation technology. The activities of Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH), cytochrome oxidase (CCO) and Ca(2)(+)-Mg(2+) ATPase, cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, the cell cycle and apoptosis, as well as the ultrastructure of C.albicans were also tested. We found that baicalin inhibited (3)H-UdR, (3)H-TdR and (3)H-leucine incorporation into C.albicans (P<0.005). The activities of the SDH and Ca(2)(+)-Mg(2+) ATPase of C.albicans in baicalin groups were lower than those in control group (P<0.05). Ca(2+) concentrations of C. albicans in baicalin groups were much higher than those in control group (P<0.05). The ratio of C.albicans at the G0/G1 stage increased in baicalin groups in dose dependent manner (P<0.01). There were a significant differences in the apoptosis rate of C.albicans between baicalin and control groups (P<0.01). After 12-48 h incubation with baicalin (1mg/ml), C. albicans shown to be markedly damaged under transmission electron micrographs.Baicalin can increase the apoptosis rate of C. albicans. These effects of Baicalin may involved in its inhibiting the activities of the SDH and Ca(2)(+)-Mg(2+) ATPase, increasing cytosolic Ca(2+) content and damaging the ultrastructure of C. albicans.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065741","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.875996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cytochrome c oxidase","weight":0.810658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c_oxidase"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.731918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.729313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.721216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Cytosol","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cytochrome","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.561136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"ATPase","weight":0.383037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATPase"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.237506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0881594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0333333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Synchronous optical networking","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_optical_networking"},{"name":"Baicalin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baicalin"},{"name":"0G","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0G"},{"name":"Ultrastructure","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrastructure"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"1248","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1248"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"G1 phase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1_phase"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"Micrograph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrograph"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Biogeochemical cycle","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycle"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"},{"name":"Intel Core (microarchitecture)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core_(microarchitecture)"},{"name":"Oxidase","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidase"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"}]}
