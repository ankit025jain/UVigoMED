{"id":51100,"title":"The efficacy and safety of imeglimin as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with sitagliptin monotherapy.","abstract":"This 12-week study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of imeglimin as add-on therapy to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with sitagliptin monotherapy.In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, imeglimin (1,500 mg b.i.d.) or placebo was added to sitagliptin (100 mg q.d.) over 12 weeks in 170 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 56.8 years; BMI 32.2 kg/m(2)) that was inadequately controlled with sitagliptin alone (A1C ?7.5%) during a 12-week run-in period. The primary efficacy end point was the change in A1C from baseline versus placebo; secondary end points included corresponding changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, stratification by baseline A1C, and percentage of A1C responders.Imeglimin reduced A1C levels (least-squares mean difference) from baseline (8.5%) by 0.60% compared with an increase of 0.12% with placebo (between-group difference 0.72%, P < 0.001). The corresponding changes in FPG were -0.93 mmol/L with imeglimin vs. -0.11 mmol/L with placebo (P = 0.014). With imeglimin, the A1C level decreased by ?0.5% in 54.3% of subjects vs. 21.6% with placebo (P < 0.001), and 19.8% of subjects receiving imeglimin achieved a decrease in A1C level of ?7% compared with subjects receiving placebo (1.1%) (P = 0.004). Imeglimin was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable to placebo and no related treatment-emergent adverse events.Imeglimin demonstrated incremental efficacy benefits as add-on therapy to sitagliptin, with comparable tolerability to placebo, highlighting the potential for imeglimin to complement other oral antihyperglycemic therapies.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722500","annotations":[{"name":"Sitagliptin","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitagliptin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.799238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.743313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.701223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.600523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.532167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.116551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Plug-in (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"1C Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1C_Company"},{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
