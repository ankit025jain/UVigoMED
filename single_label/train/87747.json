{"id":87747,"title":"Early experience with the subcutaneous ICD.","abstract":"The Subcutaneous Internal Cardiac Defibrillator (S-ICD) represents a major advance in the care of patients who have an indication for an internal cardiac defibrillator without pacing indications. Its main advantage is that it can deliver a shock to cardiovert ventricular arrhythmias utilising a tunnelled subcutaneous lead, negating the risks associated with conventional transvenous systems. Initial studies have shown comparable efficacy in cardioversion of induced and spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) when compared to conventional transvenous systems. In addition, inappropriate shocks occurred in a similar percentage of patients to conventional ICD studies. Complication rates are low and relate largely to localised wound infections, treated successfully with antibiotics. The long term efficacy of the device is yet to be ascertained, however, a randomised trial & prospective registries are currently in progress to enable direct comparison with transvenous ICDs. This article summarises the early clinical experience and trials in the implantation of the S-ICD.
