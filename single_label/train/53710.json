{"id":53710,"title":"[Application of a neuronavigation apparatus in surgical treatment of giant adenomas of hypophysis].","abstract":"The issues of practical application of neuronavigation in surgical treatment of giant adenomas of the hypophysis (GAH), using transsphenoidal approach, were addressed. Surgical treatment, using neuronavigation system (NNS) \"Brainlab Curve Dual Display\" (Germany), was performed in 12 patients, suffering GAH. In all the observation a transnasal transsphenoidal access was applied. Radical tumoral excision was achieved in 3 patients, almost complete excision (90% of the tumor volume and more)--in 5, subtotal (70 - 90%)--in 4. The NNS application on the initial stages of the operation permits to determine a trajectory and angle of \"attack\" during planning and application of surgical approach towards the GAH. The information obtained due to the NNS application, permits to lower the surgical complications rate and to improve the functional results of treatment.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501991","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.577731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.361019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Angle of attack","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_attack"},{"name":"Neuronavigation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuronavigation"},{"name":"Trajectory","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Gigantism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantism"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Sphenoid bone","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone"},{"name":"Nationwide Series","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_Series"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"}]}
