{"id":90079,"title":"Epidemiology of high falls from windows in children.","abstract":"Falls from a height result in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Targeted prevention strategies in the US combined data collection, publicity campaigns and building regulation and reduced high falls in New York by 93%. This retrospective cohort study describes children who fell from a height presenting or referred to Children's University Hospital Temple St. over a 2 year period. Case ascertainment was through the Emergency Department Symphony registration system and the Trauma Area Research Network (TARN) database. Forty five falls were identified, 33 falls (73.3%) were in children less than 5 with boys being three times more likely to fall. Forty four falls were from windows, 31 from < 12 feet and 7 were witnessed. Injury severity Scores (ISS) correlated to height of fall; both deaths fells from > 24ft. A publicity campaign is warranted to highlight the frequency of injury following falls from windows. Building legislation is required to safeguard high windows and balconies. A post fall questionnaire would enable the collection of unbiased forensic data.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and
