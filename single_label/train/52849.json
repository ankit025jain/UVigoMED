{"id":52849,"title":"In the wake of Angelina - managing a family history of breast cancer.","abstract":"Accurate risk assessment by general practitioners (GPs) of breast and ovarian cancer for unaffected women with a family history is important to ensure appropriate referral. Family cancer clinics can provide significant benefits for those at high risk, but genetic testing is unlikely to benefit those who are unaffected, or have little or no family history. The overwhelming increase in referrals following celebrity Angelina Jolie's decision to have a risk-reducing mastectomy because she carries a gene mutation has put pressure on services.To provide information for GPs about managing women with concerns about their family history of breast cancer and highlight the resources available.GPs are well placed to assess risk of breast and ovarian cancer and are encouraged to use the available resources to assist them in appropriate risk assessment and referral.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563902","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.848144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.636415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.469795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.215793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.205461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"History","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Celebrity","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.138678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.122266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Celebrity Big Brother 2010 (UK)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_Big_Brother_2010_(UK)"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.0279676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Angelina Jolie","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Funeral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"}]}
