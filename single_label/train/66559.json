{"id":66559,"title":"The value of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer in patients with previous negative biopsies and elevated prostate-specific antigen levels: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"To assess the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for targeting prostate cancer in patients with previous negative biopsies and elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.Pubmed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify suitable studies published from January 2001 to October 2013. Polled estimation and subgroup analysis data were obtained using a random effect model. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were used to summarize overall test performance.Fourteen studies involving 698 patients met the included criteria. The mean prostate cancer detection rate was 37.5%. Twelve studies had a pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 88%, 69%, and 16.84 by patient analysis, respectively. In the subgroup analysis, magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy (MRSI) provided higher pooled sensitivity (91%) and specificity (69%) compared with T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). MRSI combined with MRI had the highest pooled specificity (73%). By site analysis, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and DOR in nine studies were 57%, 90%, and 14.34, respectively. In the subgroup analysis, MRSI combined with MRI showed higher pooled sensitivity (58%) and specificity (93%) compared with T2WI. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) showed the highest pooled specificity: 95% but the lowest pooled sensitivity: 38%.A limited number of studies suggest that the value of MRI to target prostate cancer in patients with previous negative biopsies and elevated PSA levels appears significant. MRI combined with MRSI is particularly accurate. Further studies are necessary to confirm the eventual role of DWI in this field.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Male Urogenital
