{"id":79403,"title":"Therapeutic effectiveness of endoscopic vidian neurectomy for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis.","abstract":"Our results indicate that vidian neurectomy may be recommended as an effective method for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis (VMR).The aim of this work was to study the feasibility and effectiveness of vidian neurectomy treatment under the nasal endoscope for VMR.The study included 45 patients with VMR. They were all assigned to functional endoscopic surgery with vidian neurectomy.The obtained data showed that, using the rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire, vidian neurectomy treatment relieved the symptoms of VMR in 82.2% of the patients. Vidian neurectomy also led to the reduction of expression of several cytokines, including vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-5.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433056","annotations":[{"name":"Substance P","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_P"},{"name":"Calcitonin","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitonin"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.839519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.652406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.546558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.465406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Vasoactive intestinal peptide","weight":0.339581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.336368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Vasomotor rhinitis","weight":0.106351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasomotor_rhinitis"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
