{"id":36440,"title":"Implantation of the HeartMate II and HeartWare left ventricular assist devices in patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy: lessons learned from the first applications.","abstract":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder affecting 1 in 3,500 males, characterized by progressive skeletal muscle weakness and death secondary to cardiac or respiratory failure in the 2nd or 3rd decade. Being a progressive disease, patients are rarely candidates for cardiac transplantation and death from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is common. Implantation of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) offers the potential to alter clinical trajectory by alleviating heart failure symptoms. We report implantation of HeartMate II device in a 29-year-old male patient and HeartWare device in a 23-year-old female patient, each with DMD and end-stage DCM. By improving cardiac output, we were able to achieve resolution of the symptoms of heart failure and improve their quality of life. Preoperative planning and patient selection played a significant role in the postoperative course for these patients. These cases represent the first use for each device in this patient population and the first reported LVAD implantations in patients with DMD in North America.
