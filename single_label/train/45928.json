{"id":45928,"title":"Efficacy of immunotherapy with TG4040, peg-interferon, and ribavirin in a Phase 2 study of patients with chronic HCV infection.","abstract":"TG4040 is a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus that expresses the hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteins NS3, NS4, and NS5B. We performed a phase II open-label study to determine the efficacy, safety, and immunotherapeutic properties of TG4040 in combination with pegylated interferon ?-2a and ribavirin (PEG-IFN?/RBV) in patients with chronic HCV infection.Treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1 infection were assigned randomly to 1 of the following groups: PEG-IFN?/RBV for 48 weeks (group A, n = 31), PEG-IFN?/RBV for 4 weeks followed by PEG-IFN?/RBV for 44 weeks with 6 injections of TG4040 (group B, n = 63), or TG4040 for 12 weeks (7 injections) followed by PEG-IFN?/RBV for 48 weeks with 6 injections of TG4040 (group C, n = 59). The primary end point was complete early virologic response (cEVR), defined as HCV-RNA level less than 10 IU/mL after 12 weeks of PEG-IFN?/RBV treatment.In group C, 64.2% of evaluable patients achieved cEVR, compared with 30.0% in group A and 45.9% in group B (P = .0003 for group C vs A). A higher percentage of patients achieved a sustained virologic response 24 weeks after therapy ended in group C (58.2%) than in groups A (48.4%) or B (50.8%). HCV- and MVA-specific T-cell responses were observed predominantly in group C. As expected, most patients given injections of TG4040 developed anti-MVA antibodies. The combination of TG4040 and PEG-IFN?/RBV was reasonably well tolerated. However, PEG-IFN?-associated thrombocytopenia developed in 3 patients who carried the class II HLA allele DRB01*04.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657484","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Vaccinia","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccinia"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.731783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.719088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.362149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.198004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0678757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Modified vaccinia Ankara","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_vaccinia_Ankara"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
