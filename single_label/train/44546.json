{"id":44546,"title":"Amelanotic malignant melanoma of the cervical oesophagus.","abstract":"We report the case of a young woman who presented with progressive dysphagia and swelling in the anterior aspect of the neck of short duration. On evaluation, she was diagnosed with amelanotic malignant melanoma of the cervical oesophagus. She underwent total laryngopharyngo-oesophagectomy with gastric transposition with bilateral modified radical neck dissection with feeding jejunostomy and a permanent tracheostomy with postoperative combined chemoradiation therapy. However, in spite of aggressive treatment, the patient expired 8 months after initial presentation with distant metastasis.
