{"id":9541,"title":"Characterization of two newly emerged isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus from Northeast China in 2013.","abstract":"A newly emerged porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) that has caused severe reproductive losses in sows appeared in some regions of China in 2013. To explore the biology of this new PRRSV and understand more fully genetic diversity in PRRSV isolates from China, the complete genome of the two 2013 Chinese isolates, designated HLJA1 and HLJB1, were analyzed. Genomic sequence analysis showed that HLJA1 and HLJB1 shared 88.6-98.3% nucleotide identity with genotype 2 (North American type, NA-type) isolates, but only 61.1% with the genotype 1 (European type, EU-type) isolate of Lelystad virus, indicating that both these isolates belong to the NA-type PRRSV genotype. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the NA-type PRRSV isolates formed three subgroups (1, 2 and 3); representatives of these subgroups are VR-2332, CH-1a and HUN4, respectively. HLJA1 and HLJB1 belong to subgroup 2. Analysis of NSP2 revealed that HLJA1 has a 48-amino acid deletion at positions 473-480 and 482-521, unlike other HP-PRRSV isolates, while HLJB1 has only a 1-amino acid deletion at position 481 compared with CH-1a. Interestingly, HLJA1 replicated in PAM cells but not in MARC-145 cells, whereas HLJB1 replicated in both cell types. The neutralizing antibody titer of pig hyperimmune sera against HUN4 was significantly higher than that of HLJA1 or HLJB1. Additionally, genetic variability in GP5 and GP3 proteins and in the novel ORF5a protein was evident. In addition to elucidating the genetic relationships between PRRSV isolates, our results suggest that Chinese PRRSV will remain a pandemic virus.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Animal
