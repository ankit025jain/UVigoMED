{"id":18291,"title":"Humanized staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-specific monoclonal antibodies protect from SEB intoxication and Staphylococcus aureus infections alone or as adjunctive therapy with vancomycin.","abstract":"Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), a potential biological warfare agent, is a potent superantigen that contributes to the virulence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is a major health threat in the United States. Efforts to develop toxin-neutralizing antibodies as adjunctive therapies are justified, given the high mortality and frequent failure of therapy despite available antibiotics.Murine SEB-specific mAb 20B1 was humanized, and treatment benefits of Hu-1.6/1.1 and Hu-1.4/1.1 variants were investigated in mice in an SEB intoxication model, as well as in sepsis and deep-tissue infection models.Hu-1.6/1.1 and Hu-1.4/1.1 protected mice against SEB-induced lethal shock. Hu-1.6/1.1 also enhanced survival of mice that developed fatal sepsis after challenge with a SEB-producing MRSA strain. Combined treatment of Hu-1.6/1.1 with vancomycin further increased survival and altered cytokine responses, compared with monotherapy with either monoclonal antibody or vancomycin alone. Efficacy was also demonstrated in the deep-tissue infection model, where Hu-1.4/1.1 bound to SEB in vivo and decreased abscess formation, as well as proinflammatory cytokine levels.SEB-neutralizing mAb 20B1 was successfully humanized. The mAb affects outcome by modulating the proinflammatory host response in both the sepsis and the intoxication models, which justifies further development.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24803533","annotations":[{"name":"Superantigen","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superantigen"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.787992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Biological warfare","weight":0.724645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Enterotoxin","weight":0.710287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterotoxin"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.584048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.528812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.516645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.394258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.254562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.215117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B","weight":0.0923032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcal_Enterotoxin_B"},{"name":"Heterozygote advantage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygote_advantage"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Humanized antibody","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_antibody"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"War","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"}]}
