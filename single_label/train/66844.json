{"id":66844,"title":"[Effect of Qufeng Tongluo Recipe on expression of desmin and CD2AP proteins in adriamycin-induced nephropathy rats: an experimental research].","abstract":"To investigate the effect of Qufeng Tongluo Recipe (QTR) on the expression of desmin and CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) in adriamycin-induced nephropathy rats.The adriamycin-induced nephropathy rat model was induced by a disposable intravenous injection of adriamycin. The model was successfully established after 3 weeks. Rats were then randomly divided into the blank control group (Group A, n =12), the model control group (Group B, n = 8), the small, medium, large dose QTR group (Group C, n = 8; Group D, n = 8; Group E, n = 8), and the positive control group (Group F, n = 8). From the fourth week normal saline was given to rats in Group A and Group B, QTR 1.0 g/mL, 2.1 g/mL, and 4.2 g/mL was respectively administered to those in Group C, D, and E. Prednisone 25 mg/kg was given to rats in Group F. All medication was performed by gastrogavage at 10 mL/kg, once daily, for 28 successive days. 24-h urinary protein excretion and sera biochemical indices were determined during medication. At the end of the experiment, ultrastructure was observed, mRNA expression of desmin, mRNA and protein of CD2AP were detected by Real-time PCR and Western blot.(1) Compared with Group B, 24-h urinary protein excretion significantly decreased in Group C, D, E, and F (P < 0.05). (2) Compared with Group B, Alb in Group C, D, and E increased (P < 0.05) and TC significantly decreased (P < 0.05). TG significantly increased in Group F (P < 0.05). (3) Results of electron microscope showed, compared with Group B, the morphology of foot cells was improved to various degrees in Groups D, E, and F, especially the foot process structure and the number of foot processes were significantly improved, which was more obviously shown in Group D and Group E. (4) mRNA expression of desmin, mRNA and protein of CD2AP increased in adriamycin-induced nephropathy rats (P < 0.05). After intervention, when compared with Group B, mRNA expression of desmin and CD2AP were significantly lower in Group C, D, E, and F (P < 0.05). (5) Compared with Group A, expression of desmin and CD2AP significantly increased (P < 0.05). Compared with Group B, the expression of desmin protein were obviously lower in Group C, D, E, and F, and the protein expression of desmin obviously decreased in Group D, E, and F (P < 0.05). The protein expression of desmin and CD2AP gradually decreased in Group C, D, and E (P < 0.05). Compared with Group F, the expression of CD2AP protein obviously increased in Group C and D (P < 0.05); the expression of CD2AP protein obviously decreased in Group E (P < 0.05); the expression of desmin protein was higher in Group C, D, and E (P < 0.05).QTR's therapeutic effect on adriamycin-induced nephropathy rats might be achieved through altered expression of desmin and CD2AP.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672946","annotations":[{"name":"Scientific
