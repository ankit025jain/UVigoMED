{"id":68581,"title":"Percutaneous computer tomography-guided ethanol sympathicolysis for the treatment of resistant arterial hypertension.","abstract":"As an alternative to catheter-based radiofrequency (RF) ablation, renal sympathicolysis can also be achieved by image-guided percutaneous injection of ethanol around the renal artery.We report the case of a 50-year-old man with refractory hypertension and end-stage renal failure of unclear etiology who was treated with computed tomography-guided percutaneous periarterial ethanol sympathicolysis.The procedure was painless. The patient's BP decreased within 6 days from a baseline value of 172/84 mm Hg (1 week before treatment) to a sustained decreased value of 143/70 mm Hg 1 month after intervention, i.e., a decrease by 29/14 mm Hg. The patient's hypertension-related headache resolved.Image-guided periarterial ethanol injection for renal sympathetic denervation in a patient with drug-resistant hypertension is feasible. We provide a detailed description of this new interventional procedure and discuss its potential advantages compared with catheter-based RF ablation.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510278","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.804907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.761137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.75962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.673266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.592299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.509299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.474321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.466072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.40477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.402379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.343527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy","weight":0.235355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_thoracic_sympathectomy"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0289708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"}]}
