{"id":45863,"title":"Blood eosinophil and platelet levels, proteomics patterns of trail and CXCL8 correlated with survival in bevacizumab treated metastatic colon cancers.","abstract":"STrail (soluble TNF-related apoptosis-inducing-ligand) has also been observed where the cytotoxic effects of antiangiogenic agents are increased in clinical phase II and III studies when these agents are combined with TRAIL related therapies. Recent studies have shown that CXCL8 and its receptors are significantly up-regulated in CRC and act as regulators of proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. sTRAIL, CXCL8, CEA, together with complete blood count parameters (hemoglobine, platelet, eosinophil, basophil, neutrophil, lymphocyte) were recorded in the beginning and every three months afterwards for a period of 4 years. The study population comprised 21 of the 42 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC), undergoing 18 FDG-PET/CT scanning prior to treatment. Progression free survival was 262 days and overall survival was 1148 days. Overall survival was higher in patients whose Karnofsky Performance scores were above 86% (p = 0.003). Progression free survival was higher in patients whose blood eosinophil counts at 0, 6, and 9 months were higher than the mean levels of corresponding values (p-values are 0.016, 0.032, and 0.001, respectively). Another significant positive correlation was found between the platelet levels at 9 months and progression free survival (p = 0.019). There were significant changes (p < 0.05) prior to treatment and three months later for sTRAIL (p = 0.0060) and CXCL8 (p = 0.00001), based on the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. Generally, sTRAIL values increased during therapy, while a decrease was observed for CXCL8 without any significant differences for other variables.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660552","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.892448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Basophil granulocyte","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Angiogenesis inhibitor","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.718795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Carcinoembryonic antigen","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoembryonic_antigen"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.488165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.341152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Clinical_Excellence"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"}]}
