{"id":11955,"title":"Rapamycin promoted thrombosis and platelet adhesion to endothelial cells by inducing membrane remodeling.","abstract":"Recently, evidence indicated that the rapamycin-eluting stent which was used worldwide may contribute to an increased risk for thrombosis. On the contrary, other researchers found it was safe. Thus, it is necessary to clarify the effect of rapamycin on thrombosis and the corresponding mechanisms.The effects of rapamycin in vivo were evaluated by modified deep vein thrombosis animal model. The platelets were from healthy volunteers and the platelet-endothelium (purchased from ATCC) adhesion in cultured endothelial cells was assessed. Membrane rufflings in endothelial cells were examined by confocal and electron microscope. Thrombus formation increased in rats that were injected with rapamycin. Electron microscope analysis exhibited microvilli on the rapamycin-treated endothelium in rats. Rapamycin enhanced membrane ruffling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and adhesion of platelets to HUVECs. The platelet-HUVECs adhesion was attenuated when cells were treated with cytochalacin B. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine led to suppression of membrane ruffles in HUVECs and augmentation of platelet-endothelial adhesion.In conclusion, we found that endothelial membrane remodeling induced by rapamycin is crucial for the adhesion of platelets to endothelial cells and thereby for thrombosis in vivo, and that the endothelial membrane remodeling is autophagy dependent.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564184","annotations":[{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.893239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.779694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.645936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.630436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.505412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.452096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.445275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Microvillus","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microvillus"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.396419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.388744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.324937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.291965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.190254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Umbilical vein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_vein"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Deep vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
