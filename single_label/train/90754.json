{"id":90754,"title":"Acute compartment syndrome after open forearm fracture--scale of the problem and case report.","abstract":"Acute compartment syndrome is caused due to a sudden increase in the tissue pressure in a given fascial compartment. Missed and undiagnosed or not treated in time can lead to irreversible damage to limb muscles and nerves due to ischemia mechanism. This paper presents a case of a patient with an open forearm fracture treated conservatively in plaster.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24578454","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.700939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.662187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Compartment syndrome","weight":0.583969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_syndrome"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Fascial compartment","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascial_compartment"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Plaster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster"},{"name":"Mechanism (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(engineering)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
