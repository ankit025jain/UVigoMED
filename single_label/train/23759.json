{"id":23759,"title":"[Systematic review of shenfu injection for septic shock].","abstract":"To assess the efficacy and safety of Shenfu injection for septic shock. All clinical studies of Shenfu injection for septic shock were searched from Cochrane library, Medline, EMbase, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang and VIP. Quality assessment and information extraction were done by two independent screening. The quality of the included documents was evaluated by the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias and allocation concealment. Revman 5. 1. 4 software was used for data analysis. A total of 6 randomized controlled trials were included (499 patients), in which, 6 studies did not mention allocation concealment, blind and loss-up information. Meta-analysis showed that the Shenfu injection group was better than the conventional treatment group in SBP (OR = 9.00, 95% Cl [3.89, 14.11]; OR = 20.28, 95% Cl [16.46, 24.10], respectively) and DBP (OR = 11.25, 95% Cl [7.65, 14.85]; OR = 8.17, 95% Cl [5.21, 11.13], respectively); in improving shock symptom (OR = 4.60, 95% Cl [1.88, 11.28]; OR = 0.88, 95% Cl [0.16, 4.87]; OR = 1.02, 95% Cl [0.27, 3.93]; OR = 1.65, 95% Cl [0.42, 6.42]) and reducing HR (OR = -29.71, 95% Cl [-40.51, -18.91]; OR = -18.00, 95% Cl [-27.16, -8.84]), (OR = 8.00, 95% Cl [1.96, 14.04]), there was inconsistency between the two groups; the Shenfu injection group showed no advantage in MAP (OR = -0.10, 95% Cl [-2.34, 2.14]) and CI (OR = 0.00, 95% Cl [- 1.24, 1.24]). ADR/AE information of Shenfu injection was not fully reported. This study may exist publication bias. Shenfu injection on the basis of conventional treatment can improve blood pressure of the treatment of septic shock; we can not get a positive conclusion in improving shock symptom and HR. Also, due to the sample size of included studies were small and of lower quality, conclusions above still need high-qualitied randomized, double-blind, controlled trials be confirmed.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471353","annotations":[{"name":"Publication
