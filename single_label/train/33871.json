{"id":33871,"title":"Tachyarrhythmias and catheter ablation in adult congenital heart disease.","abstract":"Advances in surgical technique have had an immense impact on longevity and quality of life in patients with congenital heart disease. However, an inevitable consequence of these surgical successes is the creation of a unique patient population whose anatomy, surgical history and haemodynamics result in the development of a challenging and complex arrhythmia substrate. Furthermore, this patient group remains susceptible to the arrhythmias seen in the general adult population. It is through a thorough appreciation of the cardiac structural defect, the surgical corrective approach, and haemodynamic impact that the most effective arrhythmia care can be delivered. Catheter ablation techniques offer a highly effective management option but require a meticulous attention to the real-time integration of anatomical and electrophysiological information to identify and eliminate the culprit arrhythmia substrate. This review describes the current approach to the interventional management of patients with tachyarrhythmias in the context of congenital heart disease.
