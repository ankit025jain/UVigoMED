{"id":41980,"title":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the pediatric population: a single-center experience.","abstract":"We aimed to review our experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the pediatric population to better understand the associated complications and outcomes.We performed a retrospective chart review of children below 18 years of age who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy at a single academic institution between the years 1990 and 2010.Of the 325 cases of cholecystectomy, 202 (62.2%) were performed laparoscopically. The primary indication for surgery was symptomatic cholelithiasis (45.5%, n=92). Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed in 25 (12.4%) patients. Variations in anatomy and technical difficulties (eg, presence of adhesions) were observed in 45 (22.3%) patients. Intraoperative cholangiogram was performed in 20 (9.9%) patients and 16 (7.9%) underwent concomitant splenectomy. Only 8 (4%) of the cases were converted to an open approach because of lack of anatomic clarity. There were zero common bile duct injuries; however, spillage of bile was present in 12 (5.9%) patients. Postoperative complications including wound infection, retained stones, abdominal abscess, and biloma, were observed in 9 patients (4.5%). The median operative time was 117.5 minutes. The median postoperative hospital stay was 1 day. Nineteen (9.4%) patients had recurrence of abdominal pain without associated pathology. Three patients (1.5%) required postoperative ERCP. The average follow-up period was 54 months.Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the pediatric population results in short postoperative hospital stay and has low complication rates. In particular, zero bile duct injuries were noted.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24887542","annotations":[{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Splenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenectomy"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.731501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.159878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Cholangiography","weight":0.132628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiography"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0345263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"}]}
