{"id":69584,"title":"Efficacy and safety of sunitinib in elderly patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"We retrospectively analyzed sunitinib outcome as a function of age in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients.Data were pooled from 1059 patients in six trials. Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared by log-rank test between patients aged <70 (n=857; 81%) and ?70 (n=202; 19%) years.In first-line patients, median PFS was comparable in younger and older patients, 9.9 vs 11.0 months, respectively (HR, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.73-1.09; P=0.2629), as was median OS, 23.6 vs 25.6 months (HR, 0.93; 95% CI: 0.74-1.18; P=0.5442). Similarly, in cytokine-refractory patients, median PFS was 8.1 vs 8.4 months (HR, 0.79; 95% CI: 0.49-1.28; P=0.3350), while median OS was 20.2 vs 15.8 months (HR, 1.14; 95% CI: 0.73-1.79; P=0.5657). Some treatment-emergent adverse events were significantly less common in younger vs older patients, including fatigue (60% vs 69%), cough (20% vs 29%), peripheral edema (17% vs 27%), anemia (18% vs 25%), decreased appetite (13% vs 29%), and thrombocytopenia (16% vs 25%; all P<0.05). Hand-foot syndrome was more common in younger patients (32% vs 24%).Advanced age should not be a deterrent to sunitinib therapy and elderly patients may achieve additional clinical benefit.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434434","annotations":[{"name":"Sunitinib","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunitinib"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Peripheral edema","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_edema"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.733152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.713026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.386474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.384709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Appetite","weight":0.363434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"741","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/741"},{"name":"857","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/857"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"1059","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1059"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
