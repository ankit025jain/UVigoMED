{"id":73135,"title":"[Modern algorithms of diagnosis of benign tumors of the mammary gland: the role of molecular-genetic methods].","abstract":"Experience of treatment in 2010-2012 yrs of the patients, suffering mammarial gland tumors, in The Center of Reconstructive and Restoration Medicine (The University Clinic) of The Odessa National Medical University was analyzed. There were examined 143 women with morphologically confirmed mammarial gland cancer (MGT), 56--benign mammary gland tumors and 50 healthy women. Molecular-genetic investigation was performed in the patients-women: there were determined the gene C634G polymorphism of VEGF and of the gene G308A of TNF--a with subsequent estimation of correlation of the mutations quantity and the mammarial gland diseases rate. Algorithm of differential diagnosis of benign tumors must include estimation of polymorphism of the VEGF gene C634G. While revealing of the heterozygous or homozygous bearers of mutation with the gene C634G polymorphism of VEGF the risk of the MGC occurrence is enhancing, what may serve as additional criterion for expedience for conduction of operative treatment in such patients.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923149","annotations":[{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.848596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.72151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.659352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.632701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.599464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.596813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.569426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","weight":0.492289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.338268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"}]}
