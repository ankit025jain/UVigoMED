{"id":82608,"title":"[Ki-67 and claudin-1 expression in hyperplasia, oral squamous inthraepithelial neoplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma].","abstract":"The correlation was investigated between the level of cell proliferation and the intensity of claudin-1 expression in oral hyperplasia, squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (SIN) and squamous cell carcinoma. Claudin-1 expression and cell proliferation were assessed using immunohistochemistry in different epithelial layers of oral mucosa. The inverse correlation was revealed between the level of cell proliferation and the intensity of claudin-1 expression in oral hyperplasia, SIN and squamous cell carcinoma.
