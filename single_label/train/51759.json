{"id":51759,"title":"The activity of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha as an oxidative stress marker in vivo in paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and associated autoimmunities.","abstract":"Oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions are known to hold an important role in the etiopathogeny and persistence of acute or chronic clinical entities. Isoprostanes--a group of prostaglandin-like compounds, active products of arachidonic acid--have proved to be representative biomarkers of lipid peroxidation. The aim of this study was to determine the activity of serum 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha, (8iPGF2alpha), as an in vivo oxidative stress marker, in paediatric patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and in a control group. The main goals of this study were the following: establishing a possible correlation between the activity of 8iPGF2alpha and the presence of an autoimmune disease associated with DM1 and identifying a possible correlation between 8iPGF2alpha, the value of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and the pancreatic autoimmune markers GAD65, IA2, IA in the group of patients with DM1 and other associated autoimmune diseases.Fifty-one children and adolescents (31 males) aged 11.65 +/- 4.1 years with DM1 were enrolled in the study. Twenty-seven healthy children, age- and gender-matched, were enrolled as controls. Patients and controls underwent the 8iPGFzalpha assessment through an ELISA serum method.The mean 8iPGF2alpha value was 2090.6 +/- 3536.5 in the DM1 patient group and 509.9 +/- 493.5 in controls (p = 0.03). The mean 8iPGF2alpha value was 2178.19 +/- 4017.05 in patients with DM1 who did not suffer from other associated autoimmune diseases (n = 38) vs. 1834.95 +/- 1504.73 in patients with DM1 and other associated autoimmune diseases (n = 13) (p = 0.76). The correlation between the 8iPGF2alpha and the HbA1c values was determined by obtaining a correlation coefficient r = 0.38 and p = 0.0057. No correlation was observed between GAD65 and 8iPGF2alpha (r = 0.3; p = 0.29), IA2 and 8iPGF2alpha (r = -0.02; p = 0.92), IAA and 8iPGF2alpha (r = 0.4; p = 0.12).Oxidative stress reactions are more intense in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 than in healthy patients. Similar results were obtained in patients associating other autoimmune diseases. 8iPGF2alpha can be an ideal marker for determining oxidative reactions in vivo.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660538","annotations":[{"name":"Glutamate decarboxylase","weight":0.923416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_decarboxylase"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.761447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.631761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.555419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.546041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.47558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.450248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.20101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.127785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0818325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Alpha decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Persistent organic pollutant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant"},{"name":"Myotonic dystrophy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myotonic_dystrophy"},{"name":"Iowa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
