{"id":30359,"title":"A genome-wide association study identifies common variants influencing serum uric acid concentrations in a Chinese population.","abstract":"Uric acid (UA) is a complex phenotype influenced by both genetic and environmental factors as well as their interactions. Current genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified a variety of genetic determinants of UA in Europeans; however, such studies in Asians, especially in Chinese populations remain limited.A two-stage GWAS was performed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were associated with serum uric acid (UA) in a Chinese population of 12,281 participants (GWAS discovery stage included 1452 participants from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort (DFTJ-cohort) and 1999 participants from the Fangchenggang Area Male Health and Examination Survey (FAMHES). The validation stage included another independent 8830 individuals from the DFTJ-cohort). Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 chips and Illumina Omni-Express platform were used for genotyping for DFTJ-cohort and FAMHES, respectively. Gene-environment interactions on serum UA levels were further explored in 10,282 participants from the DFTJ-cohort.Briefly, we identified two previously reported UA loci of SLC2A9 (rs11722228, combined P = 8.98 × 10-31) and ABCG2 (rs2231142, combined P = 3.34 × 10-42). The two independent SNPs rs11722228 and rs2231142 explained 1.03% and 1.09% of the total variation of UA levels, respectively. Heterogeneity was observed across different populations. More importantly, both independent SNPs rs11722228 and rs2231142 were nominally significantly interacted with gender on serum UA levels (P for interaction = 4.0 × 10-2 and 2.0 × 10-2, respectively). The minor allele (T) for rs11722228 in SLC2A9 has greater influence in elevating serum UA levels in females compared to males and the minor allele (T) of rs2231142 in ABCG2 had stronger effects on serum UA levels in males than that in females.Two genetic loci (SLC2A9 and ABCG2) were confirmed to be associated with serum UA concentration. These findings strongly support the evidence that SLC2A9 and ABCG2 function in UA metabolism across human populations. Furthermore, we observed these associations are modified by gender.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513273","annotations":[{"name":"Affymetrix","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affymetrix"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.750386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Illumina (company)","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina_(company)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.62712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.580655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.482633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"China","weight":0.464223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.461091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.446933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Minor allele frequency","weight":0.353183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_allele_frequency"},{"name":"Genome-wide association study","weight":0.333225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study"},{"name":"Nature versus nurture","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.253154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.14452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"}]}
