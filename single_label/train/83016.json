{"id":83016,"title":"Foxp3 gene expression in oral lichen planus: a clinicopathological study.","abstract":"CD4+CD25+ Forkhead?box protein 3 (Foxp3+) regulatory T cells are important in oral lichen planus (OLP). The present study aimed to investigate Foxp3 expression in CD4+CD25+ T cells of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and oral lesions in patients diagnosed with OLP, who were grouped as OLP subtype, duration and relapse. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blotting and immunohistochemistry, Foxp3 expression levels in explants of oral lesions and CD4+CD25+ T cells from 32 patients with OLP were measured and compared, with 10 healthy subjects as the control group. Foxp3 mRNA expression levels in the explants of oral lesions and circulating CD4+CD25+ T cells in patients with OLP were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). In patients with clinically erosive lesions, Foxp3 mRNA expression was significantly lower in circulating CD4+CD25+ T cells and tissue explants compared to patients with reticular lesions (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively), and lowest in patients with a history of OLP of >1 year or with a history of relapse (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). Foxp3 protein levels in reticular OLP were significantly higher than those in erosive OLP and the control group. The incidence of Foxp3 protein expression in OLP tissues was 36.24±18.92 and 10.44±6.51% in normal oral mucosa (P=0.019). Atrophic/erosive OLP lesions showed a higher proportion of Foxp3?expressing cells than that of reticular OLP lesions (P<0.05). This study indicated that Foxp3 expression in patients with OLP is associated with the severity and duration of the disorder, suggesting altered immune suppression in the development, clinical course and responsiveness to treatment.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Stomatognathic
