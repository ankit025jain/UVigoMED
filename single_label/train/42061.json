{"id":42061,"title":"A description of the hepatitis B virus genomic background in a high-prevalence area in China.","abstract":"Hepatitis B (HB) is an important disease worldwide. Almost 350 million people are positive for Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), and one-third of them live in China. According to a nation-wide serosurvey in China in 2006, the prevalence of HBsAg was higher in Northwest China than in other areas. However, the epidemic HBV strains in this area are poorly studied.In this study, 242 complete hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome sequences were obtained from HBV asymptomatic carriers in major cities of Northwest China. The 242 HBV sequences clustered into genotypes B, C and D. Through comparison of the genotype consensus sequences, 158 genotype-dependent positions were observed in P, S and X ORFs. Clinically relevant mutation screening in this study revealed that no HBV antiviral drug resistance mutations were observed and the vaccination failure mutations were heavily underrepresented.The role of genotype D strains in HBV prevalence should not be ignored in Northwest China. Due to low prevalence of vaccination failure mutations, it can be inferred that the genotype B, C and D strains in Northwest China may have less likelihood of vaccine escape.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884702","annotations":[{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.725048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"China","weight":0.669516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.544856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.537244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Northwest China","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_China"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.026953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Consensus sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_sequence"},{"name":"Computer cluster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Pacific Northwest","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest"}]}
