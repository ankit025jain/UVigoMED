{"id":56664,"title":"Intraocular pressure after phacoemulsification in patients with uncontrolled primary open angle glaucoma.","abstract":"RATIONALE (HYPOTHESIS): Although cataract and glaucoma represent an increasingly common situation encountered concomitantly, the management of this association is still debatable. OBJECTIVE (AIM): We aimed to assess intraocular pressure dynamics after phacoemulsification in patients with uncontrolled primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).The present study was designed as a prospective, non-randomized, cohort study. The study population comprised of 38 patients with medically uncontrolled POAG who underwent cataract surgery by phacoemulsification between 2011 and 2012. Most of the patients (32/38, 84.2%) needed glaucoma surgery after a variable time (mean time between surgeries was 11.6 +/- 4.18 months). Mean preoperative IOP decreased with 2,1 +/- 3,7 mmHg at 6 months (CI 95% 1.96 to 3.56) and with 1,9 +/- 3,9 mmHg at 12 months compared with the baseline IOP. Postoperative IOP was statistically significant lower compared with its preoperative value at 6 months (p=9.11 x 10??) and at one year (p=9.2 x 10??). The difference between mean IOP at 6 months and 1 year after cataract surgery was not statistically significant (p>0.05). Preoperatively, all the patients received topical antiglaucoma therapy. After phacoemulsification, their number did not change statistically significant, but it showed a slight increase. Average number of topical glaucoma medications used preoperatively was 2.66 + / -0.66, while at 6 months after surgery it was 2.71 + / - 0,75 and at 12 months postoperatively, 2.9 +/- 0.53.IOP decreased statistically significant after phacoemulsification in patients with uncontrolled POAG, but the decrease was not sufficient for optimal glaucoma management; therefore, many patients needed subsequent glaucoma surgery.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24653751","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.840325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.758686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.650234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.634501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.559514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.549832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.292047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.228904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.173267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.102094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Glaucoma surgery","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma_surgery"}]}
