{"id":6313,"title":"Laquinimod exerts strong clinical and immunomodulatory effects in Lewis rat experimental autoimmune neuritis.","abstract":"Laquinimod is an immunomodulatory drug with neuroprotective potential. We used the animal model of experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) in the Lewis rat to study the effects of laquinimod treatment. After immunization with the neuritogenic peptide aa 53-78 of P2 myelin protein, preventive therapy with 12.5mg/kg laquinimod once daily inhibited neuritis in clinical and electrophysiological terms. Histology corroborated a lower degree of inflammatory lesions and demyelination in the sciatic nerve. The proportion of FoxP3-positive regulatory T cells in the peripheral lymph nodes of treated rats remained unchanged. We conclude that laquinimod may represent a therapeutic option in human autoimmune neuropathies.
