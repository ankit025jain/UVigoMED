{"id":76484,"title":"[Insulin determination in pancreas of guinea pigs with metabolic syndrome].","abstract":"The level of insulin production is one of the integral parameters during the modeling of metabolic syndrome in animals. Comparison of this parameter with blood glucose level can characterize the degree of insulin resistance of cells. In this work we determined the level of insulin in pancreatic cells of guinea pigs under normal conditions and during metabolic syndrome. The obtained results were compared with the blood glucose level of experimental animals. In this work we used the methods of histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis of insulin production. It was found that in guinea pigs metabolic syndrome modeling is accompanied by impaired insulin synthesis, degenerative changes in pancreatic tissue and increased blood glucose level. The data obtained suggest that the experimental animals have insulin resistance, which is the main pathogenetic mechanism in the development of metabolic syndrome.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25007520","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.895163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.587523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.581644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.450858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.203104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Guinea pig","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.141444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Standard conditions for temperature and pressure","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
