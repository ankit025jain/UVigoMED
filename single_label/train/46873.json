{"id":46873,"title":"Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of malignant liver tumors with ultrasound and CT fusion imaging guidance.","abstract":"To evaluate the feasibility, accuracy, and utility of sonography (US) and CT fusion imaging guidance for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of malignant liver tumors not visualized on conventional US.Seventy-seven patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and 15 patients with metastatic liver cancer with a total of 136 lesions underwent RFA with US and CT fusion imaging guidance. The mean number of punctures, success rate of a single ablation session, local tumor progression rates, and long-term outcome were evaluated. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by dynamic CT and contrast-enhanced US 1 month after RFA.RFA was technically feasible in all patients, and no major complications occurred. The mean?±?SD time needed to synchronize US and CT images was 13.9?±?11.9 minutes (range, 5-55 minutes). The success rate of a single ablation session was 83.8% (114/136), and tumor residue was present in 7.4% of lesions (10/136). The mean number of treatment sessions was 1.2?±?0.5 sessions. During follow-up, local tumor progression was observed for 15 (11.9%) lesions. Distant tumor recurrence was found in 51 (55.4%) patients.US and CT fusion-assisted RFA is a safe and efficacious treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver cancer.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615771","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Radiofrequency ablation","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofrequency_ablation"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.809475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.593642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.582906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.562853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"}]}
