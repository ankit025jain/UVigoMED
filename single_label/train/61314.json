{"id":61314,"title":"CT features in uterine necrosis of unknown cause: a case report.","abstract":"Uterine necrosis is a rare life-threatening condition known to be related to cesarean section, endometritis or uterine artery embolization. We present a case of uterine necrosis not preceded by common causative factors, diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) in a 64-year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome. A gas-filled, nonenhancing uterus was noted, diagnostic of uterine necrosis. At laparotomy, a nonvital uterus was removed. Imaging findings of uterine necrosis have sparsely been reported and mostly focus on magnetic resonance imaging technique. In this report, we describe the CT findings of uterine necrosis.
