{"id":45563,"title":"Knockdown of S100P by lentiviral-mediated RNAi promotes apoptosis and suppresses the colony-formation ability of gastric cancer cells.","abstract":"S100P is a putative candidate oncogene in several types of human tumors. However, expression of S100P, its potential role and its clinical significance in gastric cancer remain unclear. In the present study, S100P expression was examined by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray. Positive staining for S100P was noted in 77.1% of the cases while 22.9% were negative. In two gastric cancer cell lines, MGC-803 and SGC-7901, S100P expression was knocked down by a lentiviral short hairpin delivery system. The RNA interference-mediated downregulation of S100P expression markedly promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited cell colony-formation ability of the gastric cancer cells. In addition, knockdown of S100P significantly regulated the expression of 12 apoptosis-associated genes with a >1.5-fold change compared with the negative control. Among them, FOS, DDIT3 and FN1 were significantly upregulated, while FASLG, DAPK1, CTNNB1 and CASP2 were notably downregulated following S100P silencing. These results suggest that S100P acts as an oncogenic factor in gastric cancer and is a potential molecular target for gastric cancer gene therapy.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24677114","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue microarray","weight":0.954722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_microarray"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"RNA interference","weight":0.847261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.836841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Beta-catenin","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-catenin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.789684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.723581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Stem-loop","weight":0.697123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-loop"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.647422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.641002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.628037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Fibronectin","weight":0.622055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibronectin"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.60383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Lentivirus","weight":0.583274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentivirus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.567958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Fas ligand","weight":0.444256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fas_ligand"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.388359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"C-Fos","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Fos"},{"name":"CASP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASP"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
