{"id":40576,"title":"No guts, no glory: models of integrated care within a GI subspecialty practice.","abstract":"The focus in pediatric medicine has shifted from a concentration on mortality and morbidity to a more comprehensive view encompassing the physical, social, and psychological aspects of health. What follows is a description of four integrated, collaborative care clinics within the GI subspecialty at Children's Mercy Kansas City that specifically address this trend in pediatric healthcare. With these descriptions, we hope to inform broader acceptance and utilization of similar models across other pediatric populations.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25011344","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.605356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.425666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Kansas","weight":0.188404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"G.I.
