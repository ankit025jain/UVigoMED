{"id":61902,"title":"T cell receptor-V? repertoires in lung and blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of pulmonary sarcoidosis patients.","abstract":"Sarcoidosis patients have accumulations of activated CD4+ T cells in affected organs, such as the lungs. T cell receptor (TCR) V?-chain usage has been incompletely characterized in these patients.We surveyed the TCR V? usage in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 15 HLA-typed Scandinavian sarcoidosis patients. In addition, PBMC from 9 healthy volunteers and BAL cells from three of them were examined. Using 21Â V? family-specific antibodies, we covered approximately 70% of all V? chains.In BAL T cells from sarcoidosis patients, we identified 16 CD4+ T cell expansions in 271 analyses (5.9%) and 21 CD8+ expansions in 240 analyses (8.7%). In PBMC we found 9 CD4+ expansions in 276 analyses (3.3%) and 12 CD8+ expansions out of 263 analyses (4.6%). Consistent with previous studies we found V?8 and V?16 expansions in sarcoidosis patients' lungs. In addition, we found lung restricted V?22 expansions in three HLA DRB1 03+ patients. However, we found no statistically significant difference in frequency of expansions between patients and healthy controls.The identified T cell expansions in present study indicate specific antigen recognition in the lungs of sarcoidosis patients.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656074","annotations":[{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Sarcoidosis","weight":0.85333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.827099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.759104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"HLA-DRB1","weight":0.547053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-DRB1"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"V16 engine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine"},{"name":"V8 engine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Baltimore Orioles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"240","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240"},{"name":"276","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/276"},{"name":"263","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/263"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Expansion pack","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_pack"},{"name":"Side chain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_chain"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Douay-Rheims Bible","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douay-Rheims_Bible"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Scandinavia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"}]}
