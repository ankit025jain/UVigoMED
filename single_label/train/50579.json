{"id":50579,"title":"Clinical review of sitagliptin: a DPP-4 inhibitor.","abstract":"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is most common form of diabetes. Oral agents are the main stay of pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors represent a new therapeutic approach for type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin is highly selective DPP-4 inhibitor that has been approved for type 2 diabetes therapy. It acts by increasing the levels of incretins by inhibiting their degradation by DPP-4. Sitagliptin has been shown to be effective, well tolerated and safe in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in monotherapy or in combination with metformin or thiozolidinediones with minimal side effects.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772702","annotations":[{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor","weight":0.908125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Sitagliptin","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitagliptin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Incretin","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incretin"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.640183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Mellitus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellitus"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Democratic Progressive Party","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Progressive_Party"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase"}]}
