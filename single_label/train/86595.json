{"id":86595,"title":"Twelve-year-old boy with recurrent presentations of shortness of breath: an intraluminal tracheal tumour.","abstract":"A 12-year-old boy was admitted with symptoms of recurrent shortness of breath since 12 months along with mild intermittent retrosternal chest pain that had developed 3 weeks ago prior to admission. He was previously treated for asthma with no improvement. Initial posteroanterior chest X-ray (CXR) revealed no abnormality on two occasions. Lateral CXR showed a mass lesion in the distal trachea which was subsequently confirmed by a CT scan of the chest.
