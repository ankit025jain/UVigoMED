{"id":79082,"title":"Subtotal resection of facial nerve schwannoma is not safe in the long run.","abstract":"Subtotal resection of facial nerve schwannoma (FNS) could obtain favorable facial nerve function recovery, but has a high recurrence rate in the long run. Subtotal resection with about 95% tumor resected could be considered in the elderly with good facial nerve function, but is not recommended for younger patients. Subtotal resection with about 70-80% tumor resected should be replaced by complete tumor removal and nerve grafting.To present long-term follow-up results of subtotal resection of FNS and discuss the indications for subtotal resection.We performed subtotal resection of FNS in 15 cases and they were followed up for 7 years on average.In all, 93.3% of cases finally gained normal or near-normal facial nerve function (House-Brackmann (HB) grade I or II) and one case maintained grade III. Tumor recurrence or regrowth was noted in four cases (26.7%) during follow-up. Recurrence was observed in 10% of cases who had about 95% tumor resected and in 60% of cases who had 70-80% tumor resected.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495154","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.498877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.170536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.136503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Schwannoma","weight":0.131006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwannoma"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0926757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Long run and short run","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_run_and_short_run"},{"name":"IBM 7080","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_7080"}]}
