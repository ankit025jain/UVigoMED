{"id":38925,"title":"[Cycle and maintenance treatments in patients with reflux esophagitis after gastrectomy or gastric resection].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficiency and safety of Livodexa monotherapy in patients with reflux esophagitis (RE) after gastric resection or gastrectomy.The investigators examined 30 patients (16 men, 14 women) after gastrectomy (n = 15) or gastric resection (n = 15) who had anacidity as shown by pH-metry and the clinical and/or endoscopic signs of RE. During 4 months, Groups 1 and 2 patients received the drug in doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively. Maintenance treatment was performed for 2 months. The maintenance therapy group included 25 patients, including 12 patients who took Livodexa in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day (Group 1) and 13 patients who had 5 mg/kg/day (Group 2) during 2 months.Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (Livodexa) resulted in the significantly reduced frequency and intensity of the major symptoms of the disease (heartburn, retrosternal pain, bitter eructation), by achieving a maximum effect at 4 months of therapy. Endoscopic remission was observed in 63.3 and 83.3% of the patients at 4 and 6 months of treatment, respectively. There was a significant and steady rise in the quality of life as evidenced by a visual analogue scale. The ursodeoxycholic acid dose of 10 mg/kg was effective in patients with grade 1 RE (single erosions) while it should be increased up to 15 mg/kg in those with more significant esophageal mucosal injury (grades 2-3 RE). Some patients receiving a maintenance dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day were recorded to have recurrent reflux disease with a relapse of clinical manifestations and a morphological substrate as catarrhal esophagitis. The group of patients receiving maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg/day) retained the achieved clinical and morphological remission.The findings suggest that Livodexa is effective in patients of this category.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306744","annotations":[{"name":"Esophagitis","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Heartburn","weight":0.774299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartburn"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.616912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.566722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.368677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Belching","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belching"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.288064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.199465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.173619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Opioid replacement therapy","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.111458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Group psychotherapy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_psychotherapy"},{"name":"Catarrh","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catarrh"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Ursodiol","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursodiol"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.026362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Taste","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"}]}
