{"id":42811,"title":"CT volumetry of the liver: where does it stand in clinical practice?","abstract":"Imaging-based volumetry has been increasingly utilised in current clinical practice to obtain accurate measurements of the liver volume. This is particularly useful prior to major hepatic resection and living donor liver transplantation where the size of the remnant liver and liver graft, respectively, affects procedural success and postoperative mortality and morbidity. The use of imaging-based volumetry, with emphasis on computed tomography, will be reviewed. We will explore the various technical factors that contribute to accurate volumetric measurements, and demonstrate how the accuracies of these techniques are influenced by their methodologies. The strengths and limitations of using anatomical imaging to estimate liver volume will be discussed, in relation to laboratory and functional imaging methods of assessment.
