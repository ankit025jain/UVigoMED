{"id":43453,"title":"MicroRNA-195 inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation, colony-formation and invasion through targeting CARMA3.","abstract":"MicroRNA (miR)?195 has been reported to be a tumor suppressor. Downregulation of miR?195 has been shown to correlate with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. However, the specific regulatory role of miR?195 in colorectal cancer cells is yet to be elucidated. In the present study, miR?195 expression was significantly reduced in colorectal cancer tissues. Furthermore, CARMA3 was identified as a novel target of miR?195, which was observed to be upregulated in colorectal cancer. In addition, downregulation of miR?195 increased CARMA3 protein expression, whereas miR?195 upregulation suppressed CARMA3 protein expression in SW480 and HT29 colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, overexpression of miR?195 downregulated cell proliferation, colony?formation and invasion in SW480 and HT29 cells, which was reversed upon CARMA3 overexpression. In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest that miR?195 has a suppressive role in colorectal cancer cells through directly targeting CARMA3. Therefore, CARMA3 may be a potential target for the treatment of colorectal cancer.
