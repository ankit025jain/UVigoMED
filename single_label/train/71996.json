{"id":71996,"title":"Gemcitabine and docetaxel for epithelioid sarcoma: results from a retrospective, multi-institutional analysis.","abstract":"Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) presents unique clinical features in comparison to other sarcoma subtypes. Data regarding the benefits of chemotherapy are very limited. Combination regimens using gemcitabine and docetaxel (Gem/Doce) have proven to be effective, especially in uterine and nonuterine leiomyosarcoma. Yet, there is no available data on the efficacy of Gem/Doce in ES.A retrospective analysis of the three participating institutions was performed. Twenty-eight patients with an ES diagnosis presented at one of the participating institutions between 1989 and 2012. Of this group, 17 patients received chemotherapy.Patients' median overall survival (OS) after the beginning of palliative chemotherapy was 21 months, and the 1-year OS was 87%. Twelve patients received Gem/Doce with a clinical benefit rate of 83%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8 months for all patients receiving Gem/Doce. The best response was complete remission in 1 patient and partial remission in 6 patients. All 6 patients receiving Gem/Doce as a first-line treatment showed measurable responses with a median PFS of 9 months.In this retrospective study, Gem/Doce was an effective chemotherapeutic regimen for ES. Prospective studies are needed to better assess the effects of this combination drug therapy.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25011671","annotations":[{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Gemcitabine","weight":0.897423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemcitabine"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.731111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.545798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.46788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Leiomyosarcoma","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiomyosarcoma"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.295016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.221652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.187836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Combination drug","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_drug"},{"name":"Epithelioid sarcoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelioid_sarcoma"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Combination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelioid_hemangioendothelioma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Best response","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_response"}]}
