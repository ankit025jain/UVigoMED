{"id":61682,"title":"Suppressed expression of homotypic multinucleation, extracellular domains of CD172? (SIRP-?) and CD47 (IAP) receptors in TAMs upregulated by Hsp70-peptide complex in Dalton's lymphoma.","abstract":"CD172? and CD47 are members of glycoprotein expressed on macrophages and various immune cells, promote immune recognition and T cell stimulation that priming phagocytosis of pathogens and apoptotic bodies and malignant cell. Tumour-releasing immunosuppressive factor promotes tumour growth and transforms the tumour resident M1 phenotype of macrophage to M2 phenotype (TAMs) that promotes tumour progression by downregulating the expression of different surface receptor including CD172? and CD47. Recent studies have reported that CD172? and CD47 are involved in the pathogenesis and promote malignancies such as lymphoma, leukaemia, melanoma, lung cancer and multiple myeloma, and their expression varies during infection and malignancies. Autologous Hsp70 is well recognized for its role in activating macrophages leading to enhance production of inflammatory cytokines. It has been observed that Hsp70 derived from normal tissues do not elicit tumour immunity, while Hsp70 preparation from tumour cell was able to elicit tumour immunity. However, the role of exogenous autologous hsp70 on the formation of giant cells is completely unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to investigate the effect of Hsp70-peptide complex on the expression of CD172? and CD47 receptors in normal peritoneal macrophages (NMO) and TAMs. Finding shows that the expression of CD172? and CD47 enhances in TAMs and it reverts back the suppressed function of TAMs into M1 state of immunoregulatory phenotype that promotes tumour regression by enhanced multinucleation and phagocytosis of malignant cells and significantly enhances the homotypic fusion of macrophages and polykaryon formation in vitro by enhancing the expression of SIRP? and IAP.
