{"id":44527,"title":"Applications of nanotechnology in gastric cancer: detection and prevention by nutrition.","abstract":"New and emerging technologies, such as nanotechnology, have the potential to advance nutrition science by assisting in the discovery, development, and delivery of several intervention strategies to improve health and reduce the risk and complications of several diseases, including gastric cancer. This article reviews gastric cancer in relation to nutrition, discussing gastric carcinogenesis in-depth in relation to prevention of the disease by nutrition, as well as current detection approaches using nanotechnology. The current status of molecular nutritional biomarkers for gastric cancer is also discussed, as well as future strategies for the tailored management of gastric cancer.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24730310","annotations":[{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","weight":0.791282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.649832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.445284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.341701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.238398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.14212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Emerging technologies","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
