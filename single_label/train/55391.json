{"id":55391,"title":"Evaluating the short-term results of KAMRA inlay implantation using real-time optical coherence tomography-guided femtosecond laser technology.","abstract":"To evaluate the outcomes from using real-time optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guided femtosecond laser technology for pocket creation for KAMRA inlay (Acufocus, Inc., Irvine, CA) implantation surgery.One hundred fifty-one eyes underwent KAMRA inlay implantation using the real-time OCT-guided femtosecond laser for pocket creation. All patients had a history of prior LASIK. Uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, uncorrected near visual acuity, corrected near visual acuity, and manifest refraction spherical equivalent were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. The follow-up period was 3 months.Mean manifest refraction spherical equivalent, uncorrected distance visual acuity, and uncorrected near visual acuity changed from -0.18 ± 0.33 to -0.95 ± 0.64, 20/16 to 20/20, and J8 to J2, respectively. Corrected distance visual acuity and corrected near visual acuity remained stable before and after KAMRA inlay implantation, 20/12 and J1, respectively.Using real-time OCT-guided femtosecond laser technology increases the safety and accuracy of corneal KAMRA inlay implantation surgery with a history of prior LASIK with excellent visual and refractive outcomes.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24893357","annotations":[{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.825798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.786002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.66604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.574829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.491694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.376873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.317819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.253267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.119465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Irvine, California","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine,_California"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"2016","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016"},{"name":"2020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Pocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Junior 8","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_8"},{"name":"Inlay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inlay"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
