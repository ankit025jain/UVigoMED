{"id":91817,"title":"Free medial plantar artery flap for the reconstruction of great toe pulp.","abstract":"The great toe is an important body structure both functionally and cosmetically. The defect over the great toe is very challenging to treat. Our patient was a 9-year-old boy, presenting with posttraumatic loss of partial right great toe pulp. The mode of injury was the toe getting caught in the cycle wheel and sustaining amputation of the plantar aspect of the great toe. The great toe with exposed bone was reconstructed with a free medial plantar artery flap, harvested from the same limb. To our best knowledge, this was the first reported case of free medial plantar artery flap used for the reconstruction of great toe defects.
