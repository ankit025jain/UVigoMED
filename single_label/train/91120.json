{"id":91120,"title":"Bisphosphonate-associated atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures in the older patient.","abstract":"Bisphosphonates, drug of choice in the treatment of osteoporosis, have been associated with unusual skeletal side effects such as osteonecrosis of jaw and atypical femur fractures in recent years. We report two older patients with bisphosphonate-associated atypical femur fracture from a South Australian tertiary care hospital and a brief discussion of potential diagnostic complexities in this patient population.
