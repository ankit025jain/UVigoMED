{"id":51351,"title":"Overexpressed FOXC2 in ovarian cancer enhances the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and invasion of ovarian cancer cells.","abstract":"Ovarian cancer is a highly invasive and metastatic disease with poor prognosis, particularly if this disease is diagnosed at an advanced stage, which is often the case. Researchers have argued that ovarian cancer cells that have undergone epithelial?to?mesenchymal transition (EMT) acquire aggressive malignant properties; however, the relevant molecular mechanisms in this setting are poorly understood. In cancer cases, the transcription factor forkhead box proteinÂ C2 (FOXC2) has been detected, but the function of this factor in ovarian cancer tumorigenesis remains unclear. In the present study, FOXC2 was overexpressed in invasive ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues. The invasive potential of ovarian cancer cells was significantly increased by ectopic FOXC2 expression but it was significantly decreased by RNA interference targeting FOXC2. E?cadherin and vimentin expression levels were modulated by FOXC2. These results indicated that FOXC2 was required for the maintenance of the mesenchymal phenotype after TGF??1 induced EMT in human ovarian cancer cells. Thus, FOXC2 or its associated gene expression program may provide an effective target for anti-EMT-based therapies. These therapies can then be performed to treat invasive ovarian tumor.
