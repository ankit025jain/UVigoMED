{"id":92527,"title":"Interventional tumor removal: a new technique for malignant spinal tumor and malignant vertebral compression fractures without epidural involvement.","abstract":"Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is associated with incomplete pain relief and vertebral instability due to cement leakages.To evaluate the feasibility of a new method of PVP, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and interventional tumor removal (ITR) for malignant spinal tumor and malignant vertebral compression fractures without epidural involvement.Twelve patients were treated with PVP, RFA, and ITR. A 14 G needle and a guidewire were inserted into the vertebral body, followed by sequential dilatation of the tract with the working cannula until the last working cannula reached the anterior portions of the pedicle. Thereafter, tumors were ablated with a radiofrequency probe, and ITR was performed with a marrow nucleus rongeurs. Then, cement was injected into the extirpated vertebral body. The data were collected and follow-up was performed after 1, 3, and 6 months, and thereafter every 6 months postoperatively.PVP, RFA, and ITR were technically successful in all patients. The average preoperative pain visual analog scale (VAS) score was 7.0 ± 1.0, which decreased to 2.1 ± 1.2 at 1 month, to 1.6 ± 1.4 at 6 months, to 1.8 ± 1.7 at 1 year, and was maintained at 1.3 ± 1.1 at >1-year follow-up. A total of 92% patients (11/12) obtained excellent and good pain relief with improvement of quality of life. Seven patients continued with follow-up healthcare, and five patients died of the underlying disease.PVP, RFA, and ITR may be a feasible approach for malignant spinal tumor and malignant vertebral compression fractures without epidural involvement.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Musculoskeletal
