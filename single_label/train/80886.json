{"id":80886,"title":"Demodex: commensal or pathogen?","abstract":"Demodex mites are considered commensals of human pilosebaceous units. Their role in skin disease is controversial. The aim of our study was to investigate the Demodex infection in patients with characteristic skin lesions and to correlate the level of infestation with epidemiological and clinical features.we have studied 120 symptomatic patients, diagnosed between January 2012 and December 2012; the detection of mites was realized by microscopic examination of potassium hydroxide preparations from biological samples taken by scraping and squeezing method.The total prevalence rate of infection in our study group was 40.83%. We did not find statistical significant correlation with gender or age or with the type of lesions.Prevalence of Demodex infestation in facial dermatitis is high and its detection must be taken into consideration in routine diagnostic of facial suggestive lesions.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505913","annotations":[{"name":"Commensalism","weight":0.888734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Sebaceous gland","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_gland"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.700622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.548831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.541196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.536827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.527023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mite","weight":0.355373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Potassium hydroxide","weight":0.209824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Microscopic scale","weight":0.140999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_scale"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hydroxide","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Demodex","weight":0.0322457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demodex"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Infestation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infestation"}]}
