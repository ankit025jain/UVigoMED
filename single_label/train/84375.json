{"id":84375,"title":"Essential oil from leaves of Liquidambar formosana ameliorates inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide-activated mouse macrophages.","abstract":"The essential oil from Liquidambar formosana leaves (EOLF) was demonstrated to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in mouse macrophages. EOLF reduced nitrite oxide generation, secretion levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, and expression levels of prointerleukin-beta, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated mouse macrophages. EOLF also reduced NLRP3 inflammasome-derived interleukin-1beta secretion. The underlying mechanisms for the EOLF-mediated anti-inflammatory activity were (1) reduction of LPS-induced reactive oxygen species generation; (2) reduction of LPS-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38 MAP kinase; (3) reduction of LPS-induced nuclear factor-kappaBeta activation. Furthermore, 25 compounds were identified in the EOLF using GC-FID and GC-MS and the major compounds were terpinen-4-ol (32.0%), beta-pinene (18.0%), gamma-terpinene (13.8%), and alpha-terpinene (9.7%). We found that LPS-induced nitrite oxide generation was inhibited significantly by terpinen-4-ol. Our results indicated that EOLF has anti-inflammatory activity and may provide a molecular rationale for future therapeutic interventions in immune modulation.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25115103","annotations":[{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.857164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.833959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.768182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.74597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Essential oil","weight":0.711823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.706273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.628546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","weight":0.595585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.589214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.579132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.523578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.441786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.414458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Nitrite","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrite"},{"name":"Immunostimulant","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostimulant"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.167811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry","weight":0.0960363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography-mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"}]}
