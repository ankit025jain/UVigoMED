{"id":5041,"title":"Periprosthetic fractures: bespoke solutions.","abstract":"We are currently facing an epidemic of periprosthetic fractures around the hip. They may occur either during surgery or post-operatively. Although the acetabulum may be involved, the femur is most commonly affected. We are being presented with new, difficult fracture patterns around cemented and cementless implants, and we face the challenge of an elderly population who may have grossly deficient bone and may struggle to rehabilitate after such injuries. The correct surgical management of these fractures is challenging. This article will review the current choices of implants and techniques available to deal with periprosthetic fractures of the femur.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381408","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.661006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.606193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.593886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.54266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.536935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.474758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.0491452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Bespoke","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bespoke"}]}
