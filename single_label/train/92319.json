{"id":92319,"title":"Severe mandibular atrophy treated with a subperiosteal implant and simultaneous graft with rhBMP-2 and mineralized allograft: a case report.","abstract":"A 71-year-old patient was successfully rehabilitated by means of a 3D model-derived, hydroxyapatite-coated titanium subperiosteal mandibular implant. The implant was specifically designed to allow bone augmentation. The deficient bone was simultaneously grafted with mineralized bone allograft and recombinant bone morphogenetic protein -2 (rhBMP-2). The 32-month postoperative cone beam computerized tomography follow-up showed vertical bone augmentation beneath the implant frame.
