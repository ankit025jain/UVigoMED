{"id":82223,"title":"Changes in general and oral health-related quality of life in immediate or conventionally loaded dental implants: a nonrandomized clinical trial.","abstract":"To evaluate changes in the general and oral health-related quality of life (using the European Quality of Life indicator and the Oral Health Impact Profile-49 [OHIP-49], respectively) of patients treated with conventionally or immediately loaded implants.This clinical trial consisted of a clinical oral examination and a questionnaire-based interview carried out before and after both surgery and definitive prosthetic rehabilitation in a consecutive sample of patients requiring dental implants. According to the clinical diagnosis and patient preference, patients were assigned to the immediate loading group (IL group; n = 29) or the conventional loading group (CL group; n = 75). The change summary scores and effect sizes were calculated in the intermediate stage and at the final follow-up, taking baseline scores as reference.The oral health-related quality of life and oral satisfaction after implant therapy were significantly better than at baseline, with an even greater benefit when the implants were loaded immediately than when prosthetic rehabilitation was delayed. However, there were no significant differences in between-group comparisons in the ratings of general health status. The effect size for the OHIP-49 exceeded the threshold value of 0.8 for the domains functional limitation, pain/discomfort, and psychological discomfort in both groups and also for physical disability and psychological disability in the IL group.A gradual improvement in oral well-being scores, but not in those of general well-being, were observed for both groups from the intermediate stage to the final evaluation. This benefit was markedly greater for the IL group.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683565","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.645987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.559725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.486631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.37023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.297819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.181281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physical disability","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_disability"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Nielsen ratings","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
