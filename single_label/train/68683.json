{"id":68683,"title":"EIF5A2 predicts outcome in localised invasive bladder cancer and promotes bladder cancer cell aggressiveness in vitro and in vivo.","abstract":"EIF5A2, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2, is associated with several human cancers. In this study, we investigated the role of EIF5A2 in the metastatic potential of localised invasive bladder cancer (BC) and its underlying molecular mechanisms were explored.The expression pattern of EIF5A2 in localised invasive BC was determined by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the function of EIF5A2 in BC and its underlying mechanisms were elucidated with a series of in vitro and in vivo assays.Overexpression of EIF5A2 was an independent predictor for poor metastasis-free survival of localised invasive BC patients treated with radical cystectomy. Knockdown of EIF5A2 inhibited BC cell migratory and invasive capacities in vitro and metastatic potential in vivo and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas overexpression of EIF5A2 promoted BC cells motility and invasiveness in vitro and metastatic potential in vivo and induced EMT. In addition, we found that EIF5A2 might activate TGF-?1 expression to induce EMT and drive aggressiveness in BC cells. EIF5A2 stabilized STAT3 and stimulated nuclear localisation of STAT3, which resulted in increasing enrichment of STAT3 onto TGF-?1 promoter to enhance the transcription of TGF-?1.EIF5A2 overexpression predicts tumour metastatic potential in patients with localised invasive BC treated with radical cystectomy. Furthermore, EIF5A2 elevated TGF-?1 expression through STAT3 to induce EMT and promotes aggressiveness in BC.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504366","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Eukaryote","weight":0.844756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.795781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.761076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.686102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.621716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.569068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.568023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.47411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.467503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.413409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.360144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.274836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Eukaryotic initiation factor","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic_initiation_factor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Nuclear localization signal","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_localization_signal"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Initiation factor","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation_factor"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Bird migration","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration"},{"name":"Eukaryotic translation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic_translation"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Emergency medical technician","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician"}]}
