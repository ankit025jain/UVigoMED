{"id":69322,"title":"Prostate cancer nomograms: a review of their use in cancer detection and treatment.","abstract":"As prostate cancer treatment discussions have grown more complex, increasing numbers of nomograms to guide decision-making have been found in the literature. Such nomograms can influence every step in the prostate cancer therapeutic process, from determining the need for biopsy to the need for adjuvant therapy. With a properly counseled patient who is aware of the limitations of nomograms, such tools assist in the shared decision-making that characterizes modern informed consent.
