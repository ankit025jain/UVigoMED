{"id":38342,"title":"Corneal dystrophies and genetics in the International Committee for Classification of Corneal Dystrophies era: a review.","abstract":"Many of the corneal dystrophies have now been genetically characterized, and a system was established in 2008 by The International Committee for Classification of Corneal Dystrophies (IC3D) in an attempt to standardize the nomenclature. IC3D provided a classification system whereby all dystrophies can be categorized on the basis of the underlying genetic knowledge. Since that time, further work has established even more phenotypic and allelic heterogeneity than anticipated, particular for Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy and posterior polymorphous dystrophy. Using genome-wide association studies, a number of genes are now implicated both in normal corneal quantitative traits, such as central corneal thickness, as well as in disease. There is also a trend towards functional characterization of the genetic variants involved to elucidate the pathophysiology of these entities. This review article will provide an overview of the knowledge to date, with an emphasis on findings since the IC3D classification was published in 2008.
