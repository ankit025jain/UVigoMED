{"id":87254,"title":"Temporary epicardial pacing wire migrating to and exiting from the jaw.","abstract":"A 63-year-old woman underwent cardiac surgery, with atrial and ventricular temporary epicardial pacing wires being placed at the end of the procedure. Four months after the operation, the patient experienced tooth decay and underwent a tooth extraction. Thereafter, the patient developed an infected, swollen neck; computed tomography revealed that one of the temporary pacing wires had migrated into her neck. The patient was readmitted for removal of the wire, but it spontaneously exited through the skin of the lower jaw; the infection was resolved with intravenous antibiotic therapy.
