{"id":72524,"title":"The status of p53 in cancer cells affects the role of autophagy in tumor radiosensitisation.","abstract":"The function of autophagy in cancer has been intensively studied as a possible therapeutic target due to its unique ability to influence the cancer cells' resistance to chemotherapy and radiation treatment. p53 is a pivotal tumor suppressor that induces apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence in response to various stresses, also playing an important role in the regulation of radiosensitivity. Autophagy may either promote or inhibit the survival of tumor cells, while it was found to change along with the status of p53 in cancer cells. In this mini review, we aimed to provide an overview of the intricate relationship between autophagy and the status of p53 which plays an important role in radiosensitivity. Since autophagy can react to radiation differently in cancer cells with different p53 statuses, future work elucidating the interaction between autophagy and p53 in response to radiation might provide more insight into targeted cancer radiotherapy.
