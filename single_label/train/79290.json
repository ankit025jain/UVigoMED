{"id":79290,"title":"Shortened stapedius tendon: a rare cause of conductive hearing loss.","abstract":"Anomalies of the stapedius tendon have been reported to cause conductive hearing loss; in theory, such anomalies limit the movement of the stapes.To demonstrate a rare cause of conductive hearing loss resulting from anomaly of the stapedius tendon and to compare the clinical findings of this patient to other stapedius tendon anomalies reported in the literature.Case report of a single case of shortened stapedius tendon and a review of the English literature on stapedius tendon anomalies.This is a case report of a 15-year-old boy with shortened stapedius tendon causing unilateral hearing loss, accompanied by a review of the literature. Contrary to other reported cases, this patient did not have an ossified tendon, but rather an extremely short tendon. The boy regained normal hearing following excision of the stapedius tendon.A shortened stapedius tendon is a very rare diagnosis, yet it should be considered as a possible cause of conductive hearing loss.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451572","annotations":[{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.302191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.298552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.286135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.132974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.0381889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Stapes","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stapes"},{"name":"Conductive hearing loss","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductive_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Unilateral hearing loss","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateral_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Stapedius muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stapedius_muscle"},{"name":"English literature","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_literature"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Anomalies (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalies_(album)"}]}
