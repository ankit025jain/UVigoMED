{"id":29422,"title":"The tridimensional personality of male heroin users treated with methadone in Taiwan.","abstract":"It was our assumption that male heroin users have the personality traits of high impulsivity and low social interaction. Compliance regarding methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is hypothesized to be related to personality features. We recruited 43 patients that had been receiving MMT and 43 healthy volunteers. All participants completed a Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ). Information related to the Opiate Treatment Index (OTI) was gathered from the heroin group. The personality dimensions in the heroin user group and the control group were compared. We further investigated the association between TPQ and OTI. The heroin group presented with lower reward dependence than the control group. Regarding sub-dimensions, heroin users showed higher impulsivity and fatigability, and lower exploratory excitability and social dependence. The explosive (borderline) pattern was more common among the heroin users. The odds ratio of explosive pattern developing to heroin dependence was 4.19. Q scores of heroin use and the maximal methadone dose were associated with persistence.
