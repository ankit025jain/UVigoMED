{"id":70172,"title":"Juxta-articular myxoma: an unusual benign mesenchymal lesion, readily mistaken for malignancy.","abstract":"Myxomas are benign tumours of mesenchymal origin. We describe the first reported case of paraspinal juxta-articular myxoma. Juxta-articular myxomas show increased cellularity and distinction from cellular myxoma is required. The differential also includes malignant myxofibrosarcoma. For patient prognosis and management it is essential to separate these entities. Complete surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment as local recurrences may occur.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25226717","annotations":[{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.714233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.545087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Myxoma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxoma"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
