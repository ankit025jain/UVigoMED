{"id":54864,"title":"Macular hole secondary to Valsalva retinopathy after doing push-up exercise.","abstract":"Valsalva retinopathy and traumatic macular hole are common conditions, but macular hole secondary to Valsalva retinopathy is rarely reported.A 34-year-old healthy man suffered Valsalva retinopathy after doing push-up exercise. During his follow-up visits, the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurements, fundus examinations and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) tests were performed. Three months later, the premacular hemorrhage was noticeably absorbed with an improvement of visual acuity. SD-OCT showed a lamellar macular hole with intact but thickened internal limiting membrane (ILM) with vitreal tractions on surface of the macular. Nine months after the first visit, his vision acuity was 20/25. The fundus examination showed a complete absorption of the macular hemorrhage. SD-OCT showed that the lamellar macular hole has enlarged, with thickened ILM on the surface. Seventeen months after the onset, the BCVA, fundus examination results and OCT findings were stable.Macular hole secondary to Valsalva retinopathy had been rarely reported and its mechanism needs further understanding. SD-OCT can be used to observe the evolvement of Valsalva retinopathy.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25117955","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.88969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.448417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.320678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.239934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Push-up","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-up"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"2025","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025"},{"name":"Valsalva maneuver","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Traction vector","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_vector"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0157782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Industrial Light & Magic","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Light_&_Magic"},{"name":"Lamella (materials)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamella_(materials)"},{"name":"A34 autoroute","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A34_autoroute"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.0113784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"}]}
