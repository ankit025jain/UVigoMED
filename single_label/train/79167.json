{"id":79167,"title":"[Association analysis of sIgE, IgE, EOS and the occurrence of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps].","abstract":"To discuss the relation between total IgE, special IgE and Eosinophils of serum in blood and the occurrence of nasal polyps (NP) of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients, and then to get the best clinic index.One hundred and fifty two cases of CRS patients were divided into two groups (CRSsNP, CRSwNP). Allergen in vitro were screened, and then. the acidophilic granulocyte percentage and the total IgE of serum in blood were determined.(1) The IgE concentration of CRSsNP was mainly at one level while the IgE concentration of (CRSwNP was mainly at two or three levels (Z = 0.906, P > 0.05). There was no significant difference of sIgE serum between the two groups. (2) The EOS percentage of CRSwNP was distinctly higher than that of CRSsNP(F = 4.337, P = 0.039 t = 3.315, P < 0.01). The 95% confidential interval (CI) of EOS of CRSwNP was 3.90%-5.260, 5% TM value was 4.3, which were higher than the concentration of CRSsNP and normal val ue. There was no significant difference between different groups (classes) if the CRSwNP group were classified by sIgE concentration (P > 0.05). (3) CRSwNP patients were mainly mixed-type allergen allergy and the proportion of patients with this mixed-type allergen would increase in accordance with the increasing of allergen concentration gradient (chi2 = 8.595, P < 0.05).The occurrence of CRSwNP is related to the increase of EOS and mixed allergens. When the concentration of EOS range from 3.90% to 5.26%, CRSwNP is more likely to occur. The concentration of total IgE and sIgE are not the risk factors singly. Allergen screening result combined with the clinical symptoms can help to get knowledge of and keep away from allergen, and also is beneficial to make treatment plan of perioperative period of CRS.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
