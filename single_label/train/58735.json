{"id":58735,"title":"Sonographic appearance of adnexal torsion, correlation with other imaging modalities, and clinical history.","abstract":"This pictorial essay illustrates the varied imaging appearances of adnexal torsion and its diagnostic pitfalls. This is a difficult diagnosis with many false positives and false negatives. Diagnosis is mostly based on clinical history and ultrasound examination, with computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance used to support the diagnosis and to exclude other pathologies.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901779","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.769465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.755469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.405052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.322652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.303259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Photographic film","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_film"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Essay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay"},{"name":"Testicular torsion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_torsion"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
