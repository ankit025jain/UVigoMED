{"id":3713,"title":"Follow-up arrangements for breast cancer patients; is it appropriate to transfer surveillance to general practitioners?","abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the evidence for hospital follow up of breast cancer survivors and to identify patient preferences for hospital or community follow-up. We surveyed General Practitioner attitudes towards community follow-up and quantified the incidence of new or recurrent cancers within a patient cohort to identify their primary symptoms and thus cancer detection in the community. A 22 item questionnaire was distributed to 101 breast cancer survivors from a cohort of 921 treated patients. A 9 item questionnaire was distributed to 81 General Practitioners. Patients are reassured by hospital outpatient appointments, n=63 (74%) but have high levels of confidence in General Practitioner follow-up, n=57 (67%). General Practitioners are equally divided regarding their support for the transfer of follow-up (51%, 49%). Ten of the 14 new cancer episodes were associated with obvious clinical signs (p < 0.05). The proposed transfer of follow-up for patients to general practice by the national cancer control programme is appropriate.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417384","annotations":[{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.659008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.375486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.220445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.111952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"921","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/921"},{"name":"Confidence trick","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Network Ten","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Ten"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 9","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_9"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 22","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_22"}]}
