{"id":68463,"title":"Sarcomatoid variant of urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder.","abstract":"Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the urinary bladder is a rare presentation. Less than 100 case reports have been published in the literature. It has been considered as an aggressive variant of bladder carcinoma. Though different treatment modalities have been tried in the literature, yet radical cystectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation should be preferred in all patients, in view of high incidence of local and distant metastasis.
