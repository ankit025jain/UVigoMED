{"id":51919,"title":"Alogliptin benzoate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus continues to be a global problem, placing an enormous burden on healthcare systems and resources. Effective treatment options to minimize the effects of hyperglycemia are essential. Most patients eventually need to take multiple drugs to maintain glycemic control, and many antidiabetic drugs are associated with adverse effects, such as hypoglycemia, weight gain or gastrointestinal effects. Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor is one of the newer classes of oral antidiabetic drug, and alogliptin is the most recently approved drug in this class.This paper reviews the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of alogliptin and the results of clinical trials evaluating its efficacy at improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes both as monotherapy and in combination with other antidiabetic drugs. The drug's tolerability and safety profiles are also considered.Alogliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that can help in improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, including the elderly. It is generally well tolerated and does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646052","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor","weight":0.908125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4_inhibitor"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.846149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Alogliptin","weight":0.830959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alogliptin"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.605583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.555703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.542344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.396944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Approved drug","weight":0.358563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approved_drug"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.310276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.224556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Benzoic acid","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzoic_acid"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"}]}
