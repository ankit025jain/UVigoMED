{"id":92210,"title":"Migration of a broken scalpel into the heart after spine surgery.","abstract":"Iatrogenic vascular problems during posterior lumbar interbody fusion are a rare entity. Migration of a broken scalpel towards the heart has, to our knowledge, never been reported. We present the successful surgical retrieval of a broken scalpel from the heart after posterior lumbar interbody fusion without the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass.
