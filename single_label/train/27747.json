{"id":27747,"title":"The impact of alcohol-related presentations on a New Zealand hospital emergency department.","abstract":"To determine the impact of alcohol-related presentations on the Christchurch Hospital Emergency Department (ED).Over 42 8-hour shifts (2 weeks) between 15 November 2013 and 9 December 2013, patients attending the ED with recent alcohol consumption were classified as screen-positive (consumed alcohol in the 4 hours prior to presentation) or not. A subset of screen-positive patients was classified as impact-positive (alcohol consumption clearly contributed to the reason for presenting). Data were analysed in relation to days/shifts for gender, age, disruptive behaviour, medical reasons for presenting, and completeness of ED records.Of the 3619 patients screened in the study, 268 (7.4%) and 182 (5%) were screen-positive and impact-positive, respectively. Most patients attended the ED on the weekends (58%: 105/182), particularly on Saturday night (31%; 56/182). More males (118) than females (64) were impact-positive. Of the impact-positive males, most were 16-25 years old (37%; 44/118) or 41-61 years old (32%; 38/118), attended the ED on weekend night shifts (24%; 28/118), and sought treatment for non- interpersonal trauma (38%; 45/118) or interpersonal trauma due to violence (17%; 20/118). Of the female impact-positive patients, most were 16-25 years old (41%; 26/64) or 41-60 years old (33%; 21/64), and presented for deliberate self-harm (36%; 23/64) or non-interpersonal trauma (27%; 17/64). Of the 182 impact-positive patients, 86% (156) were recorded in the ED computer system.Alcohol-related presentations had a significant impact on the ED, particularly on weekends. Teenagers, young adults and middle-aged adults contributed to the alcohol-related patient impact on weekends. Male patients were a significant burden on Saturday evening and night shifts.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25225755","annotations":[{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.873318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.735166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.653469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.570619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.561886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.544435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.370339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.278019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.268651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.254924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.170433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.134512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.120576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Christchurch Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_Hospital"},{"name":"Christchurch","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch"},{"name":"December 9","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_9"},{"name":"1764","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1764"},{"name":"1625","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1625"},{"name":"268","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/268"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Completeness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"24th century","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24th_century"},{"name":"2160s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2160s"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Shift work","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_work"}]}
