{"id":47495,"title":"Recurrent left ventricular thrombus in Crohn's disease: a rare presentation.","abstract":"A 40-year-old man with Crohn's disease was found to have recurrence of a large left ventricular mass on echocardiography during workup for stricturoplasty. He presented with left limb emboli. He had been diagnosed with a left ventricular thrombus 2 years earlier, with multiple cerebral and peripheral emboli, and underwent surgery. We carried out redo surgery, and histology revealed organized thrombus. We discuss the management of this complex case.
