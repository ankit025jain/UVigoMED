{"id":59166,"title":"[Prospective study of efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in pregnant patients with systemic lupus erythematosus].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in pregnant patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).A total of 48 pregnant patients with SLE were prospectively recruited from January 2010 to December 2012 at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Diseases were stable, functions of important organs normal and immunosuppressants were discontinued for at least 6 months. Prednisone ( ? 15 mg qd ) and HCQ (0.2 bid) were taken during the whole pregnancy. SLE disease activity before, during and after pregnancy and pregnancy outcome were analyzed.SLE relapsed in 9(18.8%) patients during pregnancy and 2 (4.2%) cases relapsed after delivery. There was no mortality. And 44 cases (91.7%) had successful pregnancy with 12 (27.3%) preterm infants and 13 (29.6%) infants with low birth weight. All neonates grew healthily, except one with hypoevolutism because of premature growth . Neither visual field nor fundus showed any abnormality.HCQ may be effective in improving the pregnancy and fetal outcomes in SLE patients. And it is safe for pregnant women and fetuses. The patients should be regularly monitored and followed up.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851683","annotations":[{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.615575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.552115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.533764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.530251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.530211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.381533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.348449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.340416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.338413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxychloroquine"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.277191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.191487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
