{"id":88860,"title":"Return to play following muscle injuries in professional footballers.","abstract":"This prospective cohort study described return-to-play (RTP) data for different types of muscle injuries in male elite-level football players in Europe. Eighty-nine European professional teams were followed between 2001 and 2013. Team medical staff recorded individual player exposure and time-loss injuries. A total of 17,371 injuries occurred, including 5603 (32%) muscle injuries. From 2007, we received results from 386 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, and radiological grading was performed. A negative MRI was associated with shorter recovery time (6 Â± 7 days). Lay-off days were correlated with MRI grading of thigh muscle injuries (P < 0.001). Among hamstring injuries, 83% occurred to the biceps femoris, 12% affected the semimembranosus and 5% the semitendinosus. Recurrence rate was higher among biceps femoris injuries (18%) compared with semitendinosus and semimembranosus injuries (2% together). Groin muscle injuries caused shorter median absence (9 days) than hamstring (13 days; P < 0.001), quadriceps (12 days; P < 0.001) and calf muscle (13 days; P < 0.001) injuries. Overall, we found that MRI was valuable for prognosticating RTP, with radiological grading associated with lay-off times after injury. Re-injuries were common in biceps femoris injuries but rare in semitendinosus and semimembranosus injuries.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24784885","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.844295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Thigh","weight":0.576651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.265254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Biceps brachii muscle","weight":0.116784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biceps_brachii_muscle"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Groin","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groin"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Quadriceps femoris muscle","weight":0.0354274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriceps_femoris_muscle"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Layoff","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Biceps femoris muscle","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biceps_femoris_muscle"},{"name":"Semimembranosus muscle","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semimembranosus_muscle"},{"name":"Semitendinosus muscle","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitendinosus_muscle"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"371","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/371"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Negative (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Calf (anatomy)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hamstring","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring"},{"name":"Triceps surae muscle","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceps_surae_muscle"},{"name":"Real-time Transport Protocol","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Play (activity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)"}]}
