{"id":41341,"title":"[Functional heartburn--update 2013].","abstract":"Functional heartburn is a frequent disease which should be considered when heartburn does not respond to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment. Functional heartburn is defined in the Rome-III-criteria. Differential diagnoses like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), non erosive reflux disease (NERD) and hypertensive esophagus are diagnosed employing an endoscopy and a 24h-pH-study. Since clinical trials are lacking, treatment approaches are empirical. Successful treatment includes adequate information of the patient, identification of the cardinal symptom and setting of realistic goals.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934062","annotations":[{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heartburn","weight":0.799242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartburn"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.721119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.628296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.381855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Cardinal (Catholicism)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholicism)"},{"name":"Autism therapies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_therapies"}]}
