{"id":64473,"title":"[The influence of intravenous laser therapy on the endothelial function and the state of microcirculation in the patients presenting with rheumatoid arthritis].","abstract":"The objective of the present work was to study effects of low-level laser irradiation on the endothelial function and selected parameters of microcirculation in the patients presenting with rheumatoid arthritis.This study included 132 patients at the age varying from 18 to 85 years presenting with rheumatoid arthritis. They were divided into 2 groups. The patients of the main group (n = 102) underwent daily intravenous laser blood irradiation during 10 days. The control group was comprised of 30 patients. Laser therapy was performed with the help of a laser therapeutic device Matrix - VLOK (\"Matrix\", Russia) using alternation of two radiating heads: KI-VLOK-63 (wavelength 0.63 pm, for 15 minutes) and KI-VLOK-365 (wavelength 0.365 microm, for 5 minutes) in the continuous emission regime. The parameters of interest were measured before and after the treatment. The overall duration of intravenous laser irradiation of blood was 10 days without a break for the weekend.The data obtained suggest the improvement of the endothelial function and the microcirculation indices.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087414","annotations":[{"name":"Laser","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Wavelength","weight":0.698544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.574975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.451562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Laser medicine","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_medicine"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.153002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Blood bank","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_bank"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Microcirculation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcirculation"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"The Matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix"},{"name":"Picometre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picometre"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Nuisance parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuisance_parameter"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Main group element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_group_element"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Continuous spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_spectrum"}]}
