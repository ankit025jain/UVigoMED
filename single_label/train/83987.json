{"id":83987,"title":"[Benefit of ultrasound in the early management of patients in shock].","abstract":"Shock is a hemodynamic situation that aggravates the vital prognostic of every patient regardless of the underlying pathology. It has been well documented that the speed at which hemodynamics is restored to standard values significantly decreases the mortality and morbidity in these patients. Initially described in traumatology, then in every type of shock, the contribution of ultrasonography performed at the bedside by the physician in charge allows for a significant shortening of the diagnostic procedure and thus an earlier start for a goal-directed treatment.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25199222","annotations":[{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.725335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.701997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.582679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.529215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Traumatology","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Benefit (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_(album)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
