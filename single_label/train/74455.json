{"id":74455,"title":"Preventive effect of greater occipital nerve block on severity and frequency of migraine headache.","abstract":"Despite a favorable clinical experience, little evidence exists for the efficacy of greater occipital nerve block (GONB) in migraine treatment. Considering such a premise, we wished to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of GONB in patients affected by migraine headaches.A randomized double-blinded controlled trial was conducted on 48 patients suffering from migraine headaches. A syringe containing 1.0 mL of lidocaine 2%, 0.5 mL of either saline (control group, N = 24) or triamcinolone 0.5 mL (intervention group, N = 24) was prepared for each patient. Patients were assessed prior to the injection, and also 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months thereafter for severity and frequency of pain, times to use analgesics and any appeared side effects.No significant differences were revealed in pain severity, pain frequency, and analgesics use between the two groups at the four study time points including at baseline, and 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the intervention. However, in both groups, the indices of pain severity, pain frequency, and analgesics use were significantly reduced at the three time points after the intervention compared with before the intervention.GONB with triamcinolone in combination with lidocaine or normal saline with lidocaine results in reducing pain severity and frequency as well as use of analgesics up to two months after the intervention, however any difference attributed to the drug regimens by assessing of the trend of pain characteristics changes.","date":"2014-11-03","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363127","annotations":[{"name":"Lidocaine","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine"},{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.867542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nerve block","weight":0.72518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_block"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.577197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.575428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Syringe","weight":0.516808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringe"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Triamcinolone","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triamcinolone"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.257706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Occipital lobe","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_lobe"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.110637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Greater occipital nerve","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_occipital_nerve"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Orthogonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"}]}
