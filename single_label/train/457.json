{"id":457,"title":"Primary cutaneous tuberculosis of the pinna: an unusual presentation.","abstract":"Cutaneous tuberculosis is an uncommon form of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. A young female presented with chronic, non-healing ulceration involving the left pinna. Serology and skin biopsy suggested tuberculosis. Anti-tubercular therapy resulted in complete resolution of lesions. The recent increase in tuberculosis has led to myriad forms of the disease which often mimic non-specific dermatitis in morphology. The diagnostic dilemma encountered in such clinical settings has prompted us to present this unusual case. On review of literature, we could find only three case reports of ulcerative form of primary tuberculosis of pinna.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509940","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Skin biopsy","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_biopsy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.592486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.509766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.492394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.369757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Pinna (anatomy)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
