{"id":55598,"title":"Allergic eye disease.","abstract":"Ocular allergy is one of the most common conditions encountered by pediatricians and ophthalmologists and is characterized by bilateral injection with itching as the predominant symptom. Risk factors include history of atopy (asthma, eczema, seasonal allergies). Basic and clinical research have provided insight into the immunologic mechanisms, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and pharmacologicmanagement of this condition. New pharmacologic agents have improved the efficacy and safety of ocularallergy treatment. This article discusses the classification of ocular allergy diagnosis and management, and addresses clinical symptoms and signs that indicate more severe allergic disease or alternative diagnosis that should prompt expeditious referral to an ophthalmologist.
