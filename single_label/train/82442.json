{"id":82442,"title":"Possible socioeconomic and oral hygiene behavioural risk factors for self-reported periodontal diseases in women of childbearing age in a Chinese population.","abstract":"To examine the socioeconomic and behavioural risk factors for periodontal disease in women of childbearing age and evaluate the extent of public awareness of the association between oral health and pregnancy in China.Cross-sectional data from 832 women (including 188 pregnant women) from Yuyao, Zhejiang Province were collected using a structured questionnaire. Demographic data were used to measure the participants' socioeconomic status. The questionnaire assessed knowledge and behaviours related to personal oral hygiene and utilisation of dental care services. Data were divided into pregnant and non-pregnant groups for multivariate logistic regression analysis.In total, 88.3% pregnant women and 74.2% non-pregnant women reported periodontal symptoms. Abnormal body mass index (BMI ? 18.5, odds ratio, OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.27-0.97, P = 0.024; BMI ? 23.9, OR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.12-3.35, P = 0.035) was significantly associated with self-reported periodontal disease. Minimal mental stress (OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.43-0.94, P = 0.028), high annual household income (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.17-0.82, P = 0.008), advanced oral hygiene aids (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.18-0.49, P < 0.001) and knowledge of the link between pregnancy and periodontal disease (OR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.96, P = 0.016) were associated with decreased incidence of self reported periodontal disease.A low socioeconomic background was correlated with the high incidence of self-reported periodontal disease among women of childbearing age in China. Education about primary oral health and equitable distribution of dental services might be expected to improve oral health in this specific population.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624397","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass
