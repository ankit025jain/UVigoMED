{"id":76225,"title":"Part II: managing perioperative hyperglycemia in total hip and knee replacement surgeries.","abstract":"Perioperative hyperglycemia management is an important factor in reducing the risk of surgical site infections (SSIs) in all patients regardless of existing history of diabetes. Reduction of SSIs is one of the quality indicators reported by the National Healthcare Safety Networks of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2009 and 2010, the orthopedic surgical unit had an increased number of SSIs above the CDC benchmark. This article describes the impact of an evidence-based practice standard for perioperative hyperglycemia management in the reduction of SSIs in patients having total hip and knee replacement surgery.
