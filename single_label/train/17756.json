{"id":17756,"title":"Acute delayed infection: increased risk in failed metal on metal total hip arthroplasty.","abstract":"Adverse local tissue reactions occurring in metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty (MoM THA) could potentially lead to secondary failure modes such as dislocation or infection. The authors report a series of 124 patients treated with MoM hip arthroplasty between 2006 and 2010 with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Eight hips presented with acute delayed or late periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) (defined as an infection occurring after 3 months in an otherwise well functioning implant). The rate of infection observed was higher than expected, almost 4 times higher (5.6%) compared to previous historical cohorts from our institution (1.3%). This high risk of infection in patients with DePuy ASR implants requires further study but we theorize that the increased prevalence of infection could be due to a combination of particulate debris, molecular (rather than particulate) effects of Co and Cr ions on soft tissues, and/or products of corrosion that may change the local environment predisposing to infection.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851788","annotations":[{"name":"Metal","weight":0.787462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.712788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.636935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Chromium","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Corrosion","weight":0.552466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.505866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.353517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.328706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Debris","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debris"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Risk of infection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_of_infection"},{"name":"Multiple of the median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_of_the_median"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"DePuy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DePuy"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
