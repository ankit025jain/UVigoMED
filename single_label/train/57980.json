{"id":57980,"title":"MRI appearances of benign uterine disease.","abstract":"Benign uterine disease is a common entity affecting women of all ages. Ultrasound has historically been the predominant imaging method used in the evaluation of benign gynaecological disease, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) being reserved for use in the staging of malignant uterine and cervical disease. MRI is now increasingly used in the diagnosis of benign uterine disease as well as a tool for problem-solving in cases of diagnostic dilemma. It allows detailed assessment of benign conditions, such as endometrial lesions, leiomyomas, and adenomyosis, and can be helpful in the stratification of patients to different treatment modalities, including surgical resection, uterine artery embolization, and medical therapies. In this article, we review the MRI findings in the common benign uterine diseases.
