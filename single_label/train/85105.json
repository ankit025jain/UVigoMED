{"id":85105,"title":"[Long-term effects with ambrisentan monotherapy in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension].","abstract":"To investigate long-term efficacy and safety of ambrisentan monotherapy in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).Patients with PAH who received 2.5 mg or 5 mg of ambrisentan once daily between July 10, 2011 and August 30, 2012 for at least 6 months were enrolled. The efficacy endpoints were change in exercise capacity, World Health Organization (WHO) functional class and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, echocardiographic parameters. The safety endpoint was the safety of long-term ambrisentan administration, as defined by the incidence and severity of adverse events.A total of 18 patients with PAH were enrolled. Mean age was (39 ± 17) years, 8 (55.6%) were female, and 11 (61.1%) patients were in WHO functional class III. The median duration of treatment was 17 months (range: 6-26 months). After treatment, the 6MWD was significantly increased[ (495 ± 97) m vs. (400 ± 91) m, P < 0.001], NT-proBNP was significantly reduced [308 (53-1 645) ng/L vs. 80(22-454) ng/L, P = 0.005], the systolic pulmonary artery was significantly decreased [(62 ± 30) mmHg vs. (82 ± 41) mmHg, P = 0.001] and left ventricular end diastolic diameter was significantly increased [(44 ± 6) mm vs. (40 ± 6) mm, P < 0.004] compared to pre-treatment. WHO functional class was improved compared with baseline in 11(61.1%) patients, stable in 7(38.9%) patients. No patient died during the treatment period. No patient was withdrawn from this study for safety reasons.Long-term treatment of ambrisentan can effectively improve the exercise capacity, reduce systolic pulmonary artery pressure and NT-proBNP in PAH patients. Ambrisentan is safe and well tolerated in Chinese PAH patients.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25164219","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.861788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.666252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.664129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.6622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.626425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.593219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.455937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.391766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery pressure","weight":0.31147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery_pressure"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.216493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Ambrisentan","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrisentan"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Predation","weight":0.107169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"}]}
