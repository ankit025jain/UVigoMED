{"id":56587,"title":"Dominant Stargardt Macular Dystrophy (STGD3) and ELOVL4.","abstract":"Autosomal dominant Stargardt3 Macular Dystrophy (STGD3) results from mutations in the ELOVL4 gene. ELOVL4 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it mediates the rate-limiting condensation reaction during very long-chain (VLC, ???C28) fatty acid biosynthesis. The defective gene product is truncated at the C-terminus, leading to mislocalization and aggregation in other organelles. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the disease-causing mutation and its potential role in STGD3 pathogenesis.
