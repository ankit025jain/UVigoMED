{"id":82462,"title":"[The oral health of patients in psychiatric institutions and related comorbidities].","abstract":"The oral health of inpatients who are treated for mental illness is very degraded compared with general population. We observe a significant caries index, disorders of salivary secretion and periodontal disease. The comorbidities associated such as smoking, metabolic disorders and the lack of oral hygiene explain partially this situation. A bad oral state can have grave consequences on overall health.A good oral health is an integral part of somatic care of patients hospitalized in psychiatry.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620549","annotations":[{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.794242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.575428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.524904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.496147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.366214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.306078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.20437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.133996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0471077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Grave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"}]}
