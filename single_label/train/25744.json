{"id":25744,"title":"[Perspectives of application of evidence-based measures of blood pressure control in patients with arterial hypertension].","abstract":"of the study was to assess advantages and disadvantages of existing measures of adequacy blood pressure (BP) control and their appropriateness in Russian population of patients with arterial hypertension (AH).Two indicators were studied with the help of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association methodology (ACC/AHA, 2005): Russian AH registry indicator \"Achieving and maintenance of the goal BP\" and indicator \"Optimal AH treatment\" adopted from UK and US measures for the data of Russian AH registry. Each indicator was calculated in the same group comprising 37 827 patients with diagnosis AH. The data from the year 2011 were used.Indicator \"Achieving and maintenance of the goal BP\" was evaluated in 27% of eligible patients. Extrapolation to the total study group showed that portion patients with goal BP was 17.5%. Indicator \"Optimal AH treatment\" was evaluated in 47.5% of its target group. Extrapolation to the total study group showed that portion of optimally treated patients was 42.4%. Analysis with the help of ACC/AHA methodology demonstrated feasibility of using both indicators for assessment of degree of BP control among Russian AH patients. According to its characteristics indicator \"Optimal AH treatment\" was found appropriate for monitoring the effectiveness of AH treatment on popular level. Use of indicator \"Achieving and maintenance of the goal BP\" in the system of interrelated quality measures was considered to be appropriate for audit of completeness of implementation of recommended treatments in medical care delivered to AH patients.Measures of adequacy of BP control being realized in Russia and abroad allow to characterize reliably the effectiveness of treatment among Russian AH patients and may be implemented on different organizational levels of healthcare system for monitoring of clinical situation in population as well as for audit of work of healthcare units.","date":"2014-09-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177810","annotations":[{"name":"Russia","weight":0.880674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.724856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.60681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.532936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.518909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.47113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.332676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.257071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.228322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.186966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Extrapolation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Enigma machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"827","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/827"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Completeness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Iranian calendars","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendars"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Target audience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_audience"}]}
