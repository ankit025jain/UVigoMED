{"id":17179,"title":"Same-day light-emitting diode fluorescence microscopy for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in Chhattisgarh, India.","abstract":"Three medical college hospitals using light-emitting diode fluorescence microscopy (LED-FM) for diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) in Chhattisgarh, India.To assess and compare the proportion of sputum smear-positive TB patients diagnosed through same-day microscopy (spot-spot) strategy or with the conventional (spot-morning) strategy.During November 2012 - March 2013, all consecutively enrolled presumptive TB patients (aged ? 18 years) were requested to provide three specimens: two spot specimens collected 1 h apart on the first day and one early morning specimen the next day; these were stained using auramine-O and examined using LED-FM.Of 1716 (93% of total 1845) presumptive TB patients who provided all three specimens, 218 (13%) were smear-positive: 200 (11.7%) by same-day microscopy and 217 (12.7%) by the conventional method (McNemar's ?(2) 13.5, df 1, P = 0.0002). Eighteen (8.3%) cases were missed by the same-day method.Although LED-FM is more sensitive to paucibacillary samples, 8% of smear-positive cases were missed using the same-day method. These findings indicate the need to revisit the global applicability of the current World Health Organization recommendation of switching to same-day diagnosis from the conventional policy.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903936","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Fluorescence microscope","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.892072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.628091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"India","weight":0.62031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.391924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.333385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"College","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Chhattisgarh","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhattisgarh"},{"name":"Diode","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"1716","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1716"},{"name":"1845","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1845"},{"name":"217","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/217"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Military strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_strategy"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Telephone exchange","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange"},{"name":"Df (Unix)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Df_(Unix)"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"}]}
