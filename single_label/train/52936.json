{"id":52936,"title":"The effect of ginger powder supplementation on insulin resistance and glycemic indices in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","abstract":"To identify the effect of some herbal products on insulin resistance. Regarding the scientific evidences existing about ginger, this research was therefore carried out to identify the effect of ginger supplementation on insulin resistance and glycemic indices in diabetes mellitus.This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 88 participants affected by diabetes were randomly assigned into ginger (GG) and placebo (PG) groups. The GG received 3 one-gram capsules containing ginger powder whereas the PG received 3 one-gram microcrystalline-containing capsules daily for 8 weeks. HbA1c, fructosamine, fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), ?-cell function (?%), insulin sensitivity (S%) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were assessed before and after the intervention.FBS mean showed a decrease of 10.5% (p=0.003) in the GG whereas the mean had an increase of 21% in the PG (p=0.01). Variation in HbA1c mean was in line with that of FBS. Statistical difference was found in the two groups before and after the intervention in terms of median of fasting insulin level, S% and HOMA-IR (P<0.005). Moreover QUICKI mean increased significantly in the two groups, the mean difference, however, was significantly higher in the GG.The study demonstrated that daily consumption of 3 one-gram capsules of ginger powder for 8 weeks is useful for patients with type 2 diabetes due to FBS and HbA1c reduction and improvement of insulin resistance indices such as QUICKI index.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559810","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.881596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.730649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.656281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Ginger","weight":0.603204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.494288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Fructosamine","weight":0.226491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructosamine"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.201356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Powder (substance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(substance)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
