{"id":71491,"title":"[The treatment for cancer with bone metastases -whether to use zoledoronate or denosumab for bone metastases-].","abstract":"Osteoclast activation is a fundamental role in developing bone metastases. The treatment of any cancers with bone metastases has been changing due to emergence of bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonate reduces the occurrence of skeletal-related events (SREs ; pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, bone pain requiring palliative radiotherapy, hypercalcemia and orthopaedic surgery) by inhibiting the osteoclast function which affects improvement of daily life. Within the Bisphosphonate zoledoronate is the most effective agent in terms of reducing SREs. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to human receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) , that blocks the formation of osteoclast and inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone destruction. Denosumab was superior to zoledonate in terms of prevention of SREs. But, denosumab was similar to zoledronic acid for quality of life, pain and overall survival. On the other hand bisphosphonate has diverse anti-tumor effects and many trials showed beneficial to survival when it used for breast cancer in an adjuvant setting especially low estradiol circumstances. Radionuclides are another treatment option for bone pain. New targeted therapies and radionuclides are promising option for treatment of bone metastases but still under investigation. This article will focus on medical treatment for bone metastases especially from breast cancer.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065876","annotations":[{"name":"Bisphosphonate","weight":0.901267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate"},{"name":"Zoledronic
