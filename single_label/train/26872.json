Kh. Rabkin and his priorities in the development of roentgenoendovascular methods of diagnosis and treatment of arterial and venous diseases. Virtually simultaneously with American surgeons, I. Kh. Rabkin not only worked out anew method of intravascular stenting of arteries with spirals made of shape-memory metal ( nitinol) but was the first in the world who in 1984 successfully stented the external iliac artery in a 56-year-old male patient with stage IV limb ischaemia.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076509","annotations":[{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.692303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.595153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.557598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.545798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Interventional radiology","weight":0.480449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_radiology"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.407348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.40451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Soviet Union","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0418302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
