{"id":87452,"title":"Retrieval of endobronchial foreign bodies in children: involving the cardiac catheterization lab.","abstract":"Endobronchial foreign body impaction is a common occurrence, especially in the pediatric population. Bronchoscopic techniques are the standard of care for their retrieval. However, the most distally located foreign bodies are often difficult to retrieve using these techniques. A novel approach using biplane fluoroscopy, with tools usually used for intravascular foreign body retrieval, has been recently described in adults by interventional radiologists. We are the first to report 2 cases in children using this approach for distally impacted endobronchial foreign body retrieval in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. We used a collaborative approach, using flexible bronchoscopy and fluoroscopically guided catheters to reach the foreign body. The first case involved a 16-year-old girl who presented with a 4-day history of aspiration of a staple pin, which we successfully retrieved. The second case involved a 10-year-old boy who presented with a 2-month history of aspiration of the plastic eraser cap of a mechanical pencil. We were successful in reaching the distal lobule where it was lodged. However, we were unable to grasp the foreign body because of the presence of a chronic inflammatory exudate around it owing to the subacute to chronic presentation. There were no complications in either case. Thus, a collaboration of the pulmonology and interventional cardiology teams in the cardiac catheterization laboratory represents a safe and effective alternative to bronchoscopy in the management of distally placed endobronchial foreign bodies in children. Early recognition and intervention is imperative for the successful retrieval of an endobronchial foreign body.
