{"id":2780,"title":"Efficacy of intravitreal injection of aflibercept in neovascular age-related macular degeneration with or without choroidal vascular hyperpermeability.","abstract":"To compare therapeutic responses to intravitreal aflibercept and ranibizumab in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD)-affected eyes with and without choroidal vascular hyperpermeability (CVH).Medical records of 216 consecutive patients (216 eyes) with treatment-na√Øve exudative AMD who had received three monthly intravitreal injections of aflibercept (2 mg) and ranibizumab (0.5 mg) at a single institution were analyzed. The associations of CVH with functional and morphologic changes were compared between the treatment groups.Although foveal thickness (P = 0.85) and visual acuity (P = 0.13) changes were not significantly different between the treatment groups, subfoveal choroidal thickness (CT) (P = 0.001) and pigment epithelial detachment (PED) height (P = 0.043) decreased more profoundly in the aflibercept-treated group. The incidence of dry macula after treatments was lower in the ranibizumab-treated eyes with CVH than in those without CVH (P = 0.043), but it showed no significant difference between the aflibercept-treated eyes with and without CVH (P = 0.74). The aflibercept-treated eyes with CVH showed a higher incidence of dry macula (P = 0.04) and greater decrease in subfoveal CT (P = 0.002) than the ranibizumab-treated eyes with CVH.Intravitreal aflibercept can achieve remission of exudative retinal changes in eyes with AMD even in the presence of CVH. In addition, it showed greater effects on the choroid and PED than intravitreal ranibizumab. The possible relationship between CVH suppression and decrease in CT warrants further study.","date":"2014-12-10","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25395483","annotations":[{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.890754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.760045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.750718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Macula of retina","weight":0.745682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula_of_retina"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.728326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.683448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.613546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.600001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.553862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.388766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.312277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.266389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Ford CVH engine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_CVH_engine"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"216","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/216"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Warrant (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(finance)"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Foveal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveal"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
