{"id":81565,"title":"The combined effect of xylitol and fluoride in varnish on bovine teeth surface microhardness.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined effect of xylitol and fluoride in varnish on bovine tooth surface microhardness. Thirty caries-free bovine teeth were sectioned and embedded in self-cured acrylic resin and the buccal enamel surfaces were ground flat. Each tooth was then placed in demineralization solution for 40 hours. After demineralization, the teeth were randomly divided into 3 equal groups: group 1 was the control group (no treatment); group 2 was treated with fluoride varnish (Duraphat); group 3 was treated with a xylitol and fluoride varnish (Flor-Opal). All the specimens were then subjected to pH-cycling for 7 days, consisting of demineralization for 6 hours and remineralization for 18 hours repeated daily for five days followed by remineralization for 2 days. Surface microhardness was checked in each tooth at baseline, after demineralization and after pH-cycling. The results were recorded and the data were analyzed with the one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. The mean surface microhardness values of the teeth treated with the fluoride varnish and the fluoride with xylitol varnish were not significantly different from each other and showed significantly better remineralization than control group. The fluoride and xylitol varnish combination was beneficial for preventing enamel demineralization but no better than in fluoride varnish alone in vitro. Adding xylitol to fluoride tooth varnish does not appear to give any significant benefit in vitro.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968693","annotations":[{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.67539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Varnish","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnish"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.222811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.128662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Acrylic resin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylic_resin"},{"name":"Remineralisation of teeth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remineralisation_of_teeth"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Xylitol","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylitol"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"John Tukey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Involuntary commitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_commitment"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Flat racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_racing"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Poly(methyl methacrylate)","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)"}]}
