{"id":23350,"title":"Respiratory viral infections among hospitalized adults: experience of a single tertiary healthcare hospital.","abstract":"Following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, there have been a large number of studies focusing on the epidemiology and outcomes of influenza A infection; however, there have been fewer studies focused on other respiratory viral infections.To define the epidemiology and outcomes of non-influenza respiratory viral infections in hospitalized adults.Data on all patients ?18 years of age with a positive molecular respiratory viral assay who were hospitalized at a single tertiary healthcare system in Chicago, IL, from retrospectively collected and analyzed.Over the study period, 503 of 46 024 (1Â·1%) admitted patients had a positive RVP result. Human rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus followed by influenza A, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and influenza B, respectively. Infection in immunocompromised patients was associated with a higher rate of progression to pneumonia and death.Non-influenza respiratory viral infections are commonly detected among adults admitted to the hospital and can cause serious illness. The data can inform the prioritization of research into novel antiviral therapies for these infections.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490751","annotations":[{"name":"Adenoviridae","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae"},{"name":"Rhinovirus","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"2009 flu pandemic","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic"},{"name":"Human respiratory syncytial virus","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_respiratory_syncytial_virus"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Influenza A virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Human parainfluenza viruses","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_parainfluenza_viruses"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Influenza A virus subtype H1N1","weight":0.767827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1"},{"name":"Influenzavirus B","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenzavirus_B"},{"name":"Metapneumovirus","weight":0.73452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metapneumovirus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.605421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.513652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.460846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.437526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.375056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.283573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Syncytium","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncytium"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Chicago","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Data (Star Trek)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"}]}
