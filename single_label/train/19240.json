{"id":19240,"title":"Evaluation of avibactam-supplemented combination disk tests for the detection of OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.","abstract":"The ability of various combination disk tests (CDTs) incorporating avibactam to detect OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae was evaluated. The CDT using 30-?g temocillin alone and supplemented with 5-?g avibactam showed good performance and could be an adjunctive test to the classic CDT containing class A and class B carbapenemase inhibitors for the positive discrimination of OXA-48 carbapenemase producers from carbapenemase-negative strains.
