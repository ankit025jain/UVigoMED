{"id":79638,"title":"Innovations in diagnosis and post-therapeutic monitoring of Chagas disease: Simultaneous flow cytometric detection of IgG1 antibodies anti-live amastigote, anti-live trypomastigote, and anti-fixed epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi.","abstract":"This study developed a remarkable methodological innovation (FC-ATE) which enables simultaneous detection of antibodies specific to the three evolutive forms of Trypanosoma cruzi: live amastigote (AMA), live trypomastigote (TRYPO), and fixed epimastigote (EPI) using a differential fluorescence staining as low (AMA), intermediate (TRYPO), and high (EPI). An outstanding performance (100%) was observed in the discrimination of the chagasic (CH) and non-chagasic (NCH) patients. In the applicability of FC-ATE in the diagnosis of Chagas disease, 100% of the CH samples presented positivity in the percentage of positive fluorescent parasites (PPFP) for all the three forms of T. cruzi. Moreover, 94% of the samples of NCH presented negative values of PPFP with AMA and TRYPO, and 88% with EPI. Samples from the NCH group with false-positive results were those belonging to the leishmaniasis patients. Considering the applicability of this technique in post-therapeutic monitoring of Chagas disease, 100% of non-treated (NT) and treated non-cured (TNC) samples were positive with the three T. cruzi evolutive forms, while a percentage of 100% from samples of the treated cured (TC) patients were negative with AMA, 93% with TRYPO and 96% with EPI. The comparison between FC-ATE and two other flow cytometric tests using the same samples of patients NT, TNC and TC showed that the three techniques presented different reactivities, although categorical correlation between the methodologies was observed. Taken together, the results obtained with the novel FC-ATE method have shown an outstanding performance in the diagnosis and post-therapeutic monitoring of Chagas disease.
