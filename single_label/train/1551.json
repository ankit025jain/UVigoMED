{"id":1551,"title":"Water pipes and E-cigarettes: new faces of an ancient enemy.","abstract":"In a world grappling with tobacco addiction, the hookah (water-pipe) and the electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) are creating new problems. Apart from posing the inherent danger of nicotine addiction, they both seem to be wolves cloaked in the sheep-skin of consumer-perceived safety, at least in comparison to the cigarette. However it seems that the e-cigarette may have a role in a nicotine-replacement therapy. There has been a wave of interest around the world in analysing these phenomena. The following review discusses the current data regarding the hookah and the e-cigarette. A PubMed, Medline and Google search using the keywords'sheesha', 'hookah', water-pipe', 'electronic cigarette', 'e-cigarette', 'vapers' was carried out.The studies carried out between 2007-2013 were included in this review. Information available in the public domain on internet websites was included to study the perception of the lay consumer regarding the hookah and the e-cigarette.","date":"2014-10-20","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25327035","annotations":[{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.662425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Nicotine","weight":0.657184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine"},{"name":"Public domain","weight":0.587584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.456857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.39835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Google","weight":0.337377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.327302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Ancient history","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Gray wolf","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.157943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Hookah","weight":0.090579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookah"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Leather","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Electronic cigarette","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Laity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laity"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Grappling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling"},{"name":"Smoking pipe (tobacco)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_pipe_(tobacco)"},{"name":"Face (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(geometry)"},{"name":"Water pipe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pipe"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Google Search","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Invisibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisibility"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
