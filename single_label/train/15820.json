{"id":15820,"title":"Faecal carriage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in healthy humans: antimicrobial susceptibility and global genetic lineages.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to analyse the Pseudomonas aeruginosa faecal carriage rate in 98 healthy humans and to perform the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of recovered isolates. The genetic relatedness among the isolates was analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing that was compared with worldwide epidemic clones. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from eight healthy individuals (8.2%), and two of them remained colonized after 5 months (in one case by the same clone). All 10 isolates (one/sample) were susceptible to 14 tested antipseudomonal agents and lacked integron structures. Six pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns and six sequence types (ST245, ST253, ST254, ST274, ST663 and the new one, ST1059) were identified among them. Four groups of OprD alterations were detected based on mutations and deletions related to PAO1 reference strain in our carbapenem-susceptible strains. This is the first study focused on P. aeruginosa from faecal samples of healthy humans that provides additional insights into the antimicrobial resistance and genetic diversity of P. aeruginosa. Although the isolates were antimicrobial susceptible, most of the sequence types detected were genetically related to Spanish epidemic clones or globally spread sequence types, such as ST274 and ST253.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25121169","annotations":[{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.750386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.686781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.680784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.592735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Kin selection","weight":0.50729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.268332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.266363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.187512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.129987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.112973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.110498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Coefficient of relationship","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_relationship"},{"name":"Genetic distance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_distance"},{"name":"Integron","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integron"},{"name":"Multilocus sequence typing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilocus_sequence_typing"},{"name":"Carriage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"}]}
