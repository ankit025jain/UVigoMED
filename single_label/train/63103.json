{"id":63103,"title":"Clinical value of pre-transplant minimal residual disease in childhood lymphoblastic leukaemia: the results of the French minimal residual disease-guided protocol.","abstract":"Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a major predictive factor of the cure rate of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Haematopoietic cell transplantation is a treatment option for patients at high risk of relapse. Between 2005 and 2008, we conducted a prospective study evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of the reduction of immunosuppressive medication shortly after a non-ex vivo T depleted myeloablative transplantation. Immunoglobulin (Ig)H/T-cell receptor MRD 30 d before transplant could be obtained in 122 of the 133 cases of high-risk paediatric ALL enrolled. There were no significant demographic differences except remission status (first or second complete remission) between the 95 children with MRD <10(-3) and the 27 with MRD ?10(-3) . Multivariate analysis identified sex match and MRD as being significantly associated with 5-year survival. MRD ?10(-3) compromised the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (43路6 vs. 16路7%). Complete remission status and stem cell source did not modify the relationship between MRD and prognosis. Thus, pre-transplant MRD is still a major predictor of outcome for ALL. The MRD-guided strategy resulted in survival for 72路3% of patients with MRD<10(-3) and 40路4% of those with MRD ?10(-3).","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479958","annotations":[{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.828539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.780965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.740963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.618634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.612631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.443886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.395769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.372954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.324969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"France","weight":0.0381889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"}]}
