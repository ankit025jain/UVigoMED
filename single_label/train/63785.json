{"id":63785,"title":"Orbital and central nervous system extension of nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.","abstract":"To describe a case series of nasal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) with orbital and central nervous system extension.This is a retrospective study. The medical records of 9 patients with a diagnosis of NKTL were reviewed. All patients had a positive biopsy for CD3, CD56, T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1, and granzyme expression and CT imaging of nose, sinuses, orbits, and brain. Five patients were also examined with MRI.Orbital extension occurred in 6 patients. All had extraocular muscle enlargement and 5 showed signs of perineural spread.NKTL is a polymorphous disease. Extraocular muscle involvement and perineural spread are overlooked features that explain dissemination of the tumor to both the orbit and the central nervous system.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398482","annotations":[{"name":"Extraocular muscles","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraocular_muscles"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.769861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.656666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.613936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.57016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.492859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Neural cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Orbit","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Perineural invasion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineural_invasion"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Polymorphism (materials science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(materials_science)"},{"name":"Perineurium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineurium"}]}
