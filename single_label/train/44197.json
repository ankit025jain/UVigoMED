{"id":44197,"title":"Choloperitoneum causes extensive coloring of the abdominal wall skin.","abstract":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, because it is the less invasive surgical procedure, has been established as the procedure of choice for the treatment of patients with symptomatic gallbladder stones. However, bile leakage after laparoscopic cholecystectomy should not be overlooked. It is generally due to a minor biliary complication, although it can sometimes herald a major duct injury. Bile leakage rates of 1.2% to 4.0% in laparoscopic cholecystectomies have been reported, which are higher than the incidence with open cholecystectomies.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746859","annotations":[{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.844719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.626522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.560418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0353015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Herald","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herald"}]}
