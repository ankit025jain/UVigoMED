{"id":48784,"title":"[Risks and benefits: new concepts of treatment of late-onset hypogonadism].","abstract":"Late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) is a clinical and bio-chemical syndrome associated with advancing age in males and seriously affects the quality of life of some of the patients. A classical therapeutic option for LOH is testosterone supplementary treatment (TST). Its effectiveness has been verified, whereas its long-term safety remains to be further evaluated. With deeper insights into LOH, many new therapeutic strategies have been proposed, which include the treatments with gonadotropins, testosterone precursors (such as dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]), non-aromatizable androgens (such as dihydrotestosterone [DHT]), antiestrogens (such as aromatase inhibitors and estrogen receptor antagonists), and Chinese medicine. Meanwhile, studies on the transplantation of Leydig stem cells, selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), and selective estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) agonists have shed new light on the treatment of LOH.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029850","annotations":[{"name":"Dihydrotestosterone","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone"},{"name":"Dehydroepiandrosterone","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone"},{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Aromatase","weight":0.856479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.847851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Aromatase inhibitor","weight":0.826996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Leydig cell","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leydig_cell"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.511358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Selective androgen receptor modulator","weight":0.314997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_androgen_receptor_modulator"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor beta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor_beta"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Word stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Moulting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulting"}]}
