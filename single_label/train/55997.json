{"id":55997,"title":"Exudative vasculopathy in a child with Leber congenital amaurosis.","abstract":"Leber congenital amaurosis is a severe retinal dystrophy that causes blindness or severe visual impairment, usually before the age of 1 year. We present the case of a 13-year-old girl with Leber congenital amaurosis who developed an exudative vasculopathy. She was successfully treated with cryotherapy and argon green laser. To our knowledge, only 4 cases of this condition in patients with Leber congenital amaurosis have been reported previously. This phenotype may be related to c.2991+1655A>G (p.Cys998X) mutations in the CEP290 gene.
