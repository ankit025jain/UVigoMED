{"id":47874,"title":"A novel staging model to classify oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients in China.","abstract":"Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant subtype of oesophageal carcinoma in China, with the overall 5-year survival rate of <10%. The current tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system has become so complex that it is not easy to use in the life expectancy assessment. We aim to combine clinical variables and biomarkers to develop and validate a relative simple and reliable model, named the FENSAM, for ESCC prognosis.To build the FENSAM, we analysed 22 potential prognostic factors from 461 patients, including 9 biomarkers (Ezrin, Fascin, desmocollin 2 (DSC2), pFascin, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), connective-tissue growth factor (CTGF), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), NGAL receptor (NGALR), and cysteine-rich angiogenic protein 61 (CYR61)) and other 13 clinical variables. We selected significant factors associated with survival of ESCC patients, and used them to build our FENSAM model. We then obtained the hazard risk score of the model to classify ESCC patients. In addition, we validated the model in an independent cohort of 290 patients from the same hospital. The predictive performance of the model was assessed by the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.We found six markers significantly associated with survival of ESCC patients (Ezrin, Fascin, ATF3, surgery extent, N-stage, and M-stage). They were combined to create a novel four-stage FENSAM model for patients' classification. FENSAM possessed a high classification precision similar to the TNM staging system, but with a much simpler model. The efficiency of FENSAM was evaluated by different quantiles of AUC and the results of survival analysis. The validation result demonstrated the potential of the FENSAM model to improve classification accuracy for ESCC patients.FENSAM provides an alternative classifier for ESCC patients with a high classification precision using a simple model.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Digestive System
