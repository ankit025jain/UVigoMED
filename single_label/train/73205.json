{"id":73205,"title":"Monitoring the AML1/ETO fusion transcript to predict outcome in childhood acute myeloid leukemia.","abstract":"To determine the prognostic significance of the detection of the minimal residual disease (MRD) in children with AML1/ETO AML, we compared the results of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR).Between January 2006 and February 2013, 70 patients (?16 years of age) with AML1/ETO AML were included in our study. Bone marrow samples were evaluated using by both RT-PCR and RQ-PCR assays. AML1/ETO transcripts were normalized to 10(5) ABL copies.When treated with fewer than four courses of therapy, no association was found between positive RT-PCR results and relapse. After four courses of therapy, a positive RT-PCR result was correlated with a probability of relapse. After induction chemotherapy, a >1.8 log reduction in AML1/ETO transcripts in BM determined by RQ-PCR may represent a subgroup of patients at low risk for relapse. MRD levels after consolidation (Courses 2 and 3) were also informative.Both RT-PCR and RQ-PCR can be used to detect MRD in childhood AML1/ETO AML. RQ-PCR can identify patients who are at high risk of relapse earlier than can RT-PCR.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24920269","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.796956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.765763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.573145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.460442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.431242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.388693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.188234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.153971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Abl gene","weight":0.115869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abl_gene"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"RUNX1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUNX1"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"European Theater of Operations United States Army","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Theater_of_Operations_United_States_Army"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
