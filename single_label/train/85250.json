{"id":85250,"title":"Role of budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy: a pragmatic study.","abstract":"Many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FORM) for Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (SMART®) for asthma control. However, there are concerns regarding its over-use and effectiveness.To examine asthma control and over-use of BUD/FORM in real-life situations.This study was a hospital-based cross-sectional and multi-center design. Patients were enrolled if they were >12 years old, had persistent asthma, had received BUD/FORM SMART for 3 months or longer, and smoked less than 10 pack-year.Of the 792 patients who used BUD/FORM for a mean of 28.2 months, all used BUD/FORM as maintenance and only 22.2% of the patients required BUD/FORM to relieve symptoms. The average inhaled corticosteroid dose used was 355.3±154.9?g/day (95% CI: 344.5 to 366.1). In 792 patients, constituting 2,376 person-months of observations, there was only one patient who used more than 12 puffs/ day of BUD/FORM for 3 days, with a rate of 0.015 days per patient per year (95%CI: 0.003 to 0.044), without reporting any adverse events. The percentage of asthma control according to the Asthma Control Test score of 20 or greater was 86.5% (95% CI: 84.1 to 88.9). Overall, the rates per patient per year of emergency room (ER) visits and hospital admissions were 0.18 and 0.21, respectively.BUD/FORM SMART is effective in real-life clinical practice. On average, patients who received a low dose steroid in the form of BUD/FORM, had a satisfactorily high proportion of asthma control and had a low rate of ER visits and hospitalization. BUD/FORM maintenance and reliever therapy seems to be promising as a treatment approach for persistent asthma in every day clinical practice.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25003730","annotations":[{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.908125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.679204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.580041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.480921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.103663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.027246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"792","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/792"},{"name":"355","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/355"},{"name":"344","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/344"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Pragmatism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Relief pitcher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher"},{"name":"Puffs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffs"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Test score","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_score"}]}
