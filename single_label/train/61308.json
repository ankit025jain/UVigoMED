{"id":61308,"title":"Frontline low-dose alemtuzumab with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prolongs progression-free survival in high-risk CLL.","abstract":"The randomized Haemato Oncology Foundation for Adults in The Netherlands 68 phase 3 trial compared front-line chemotherapy with chemotherapy plus the CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab for high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia, defined as at least 1 of the following: unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain genes, deletion 17p or 11q, or trisomy 12. Fit patients were randomized to receive either 6 28-day cycles of oral FC chemotherapy (days 1 through 3: fludarabine 40 mg/m(2) per day and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m(2) per day: n = 139) or FC plus subcutaneous alemtuzumab 30 mg day 1 (FCA, n = 133). FCA prolonged the primary end point, progression-free survival (3-year progression-free survival 53 vs 37%, P = .01), but not the secondary end point, overall survival (OS). However, a post hoc analysis showed that FCA increased OS in patients younger than 65 years (3-year OS 85% vs 76%, P = .035). FCA also increased the overall response rate (88 vs 78%, P = .036), and the bone marrow minimal residual disease-negative complete remission rate (64% vs 43%, P = .016). Opportunistic infections were more frequent following FCA, but without an increase in treatment related mortality (FCA: 3.8%, FC: 4.3%). FCA improves progression-free survival in high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia. As anticipated, FCA is more immunosuppressive than FC, but with due vigilance, does not lead to a higher treatment-related mortality. This study was registered at www.trialregister.nl as trial no. NTR529.
