{"id":77163,"title":"Vitamin D supplementation during the first two years of life in Izmir, Turkey.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D supplementation and risk factors for non-supplemented infants in Izmir, Turkey.This cross-sectional study was carried out in Well-Child Care Clinics in Izmir, Turkey. Parents filled a questionnaire about socio-demographic characteristics and the use of vitamin D. SPSS version 16.0 was used for statistical analysis.A total of 1002 children (aged 1 to 24 months) were enrolled in the study. The supplementation rates of vitamin D were 77% in the first 3 months of life, 57% at 10 to 12 months. Economic status of family, education of parents, occupational status of mothers and parity were associated factors with the use of vitamin D supplements in infants (P<0.05). However, when the data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis, only education of mother seems to be statistically significant independent variable in decreasing non-supplementation/ irregular supplementation.Vitamin D supplementation rates seem to be not satisfactory in Izmir. Therefore, the importance of vitamin D supplementation in infants should be emphasized in every well-child care visit to prevent vitamin D deficiency.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24835447","annotations":[{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.884338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.777398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.737751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.564224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.46626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.207246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0776294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Izmir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izmir"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.020459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"1002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1002"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Izmir, Turkey","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izmir,_Turkey"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Occupational prestige","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_prestige"}]}
