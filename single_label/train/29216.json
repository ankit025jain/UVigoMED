{"id":29216,"title":"Introduction to special section: ADHD, impulsivity, and alcohol abuse.","abstract":"The goal of this special section is to highlight progress made and primary research reports on the relation between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), impulsivity, and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) utilizing a diverse range of methods. The four papers examine various psychological processes underlying the broad construct of impulsivity that are related largely to impairments in inhibitory control. The section addresses the influences of reward sensitivity, working memory/attention control, and social functioning in the development and persistence of AUDs among individuals with ADHD. These papers are important because they approach the relation between ADHD and AUDs, and the role of impulsivity, from varied perspectives.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708145","annotations":[{"name":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","weight":0.840325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.693124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Impulsivity","weight":0.470553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulsivity"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.4439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.322201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.133765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Reward system","weight":0.110498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.0320564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Persistence (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Securities research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_research"},{"name":"Disorder (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(band)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Primary research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_research"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
