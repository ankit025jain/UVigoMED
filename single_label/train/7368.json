{"id":7368,"title":"Rosiglitazone modulates pigeon atherosclerotic lipid accumulation and gene expression in vitro.","abstract":"Atherosclerosis is a major contributor to the overall United States mortality rate, primarily in the form of heart attacks and stroke. Unlike the human disease, which is believed to be multifactorial, pigeon atherosclerosis is due to a single gene autosomal recessive trait. The White Carneau (WC-As) strain develops atherosclerotic plaques without the presence of known environmental risk factors such as diet and classic predictors such as blood pressure or blood cholesterol levels. With similar parameters, the Show Racer (SR-Ar) is resistant to plaque development. Thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone, activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR?) raising cellular sensitivity to insulin. The effect of rosiglitazone was evaluated in aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) from these 2 pigeon breeds. Primary SMC cultures were prepared from WC-As and SR-Ar squabs. Cell monolayers, which achieved confluence in 7 d, were treated with 0 or 4 ÂµM rosiglitazone for 24 h. Cellular lipid accumulation was evaluated by oil red O staining. Control WC-As cells had significantly higher vacuole scores and lipid content than did the SR-Ar control cells. Rosiglitazone treatment decreased WC-As lipid vacuoles significantly compared with the control cells. On the other hand, lipid vacuoles in the treated and untreated SR-Ar cells did not differ significantly. The effect of rosiglitazone on WC-As SMC gene expression was compared with control SMC using representational difference analysis. Significant transcript increases were found for caveolin and RNA binding motif in the control cells compared with the rosiglitazone-treated cells as well as cytochrome p450 family 17 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (CYP171A) in the rosiglitazone-treated cells compared with the control cells. Although rosiglitazone was selected for these experiments because of its role as a PPAR? agonist, it appears that the drug also tempers c-myc expression, as genes related to this second transcription factor were differentially expressed. Both PPAR? and c-myc appear to affect WC-As SMC gene expression, which may relate to disease development, progression, or both.
