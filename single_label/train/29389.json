{"id":29389,"title":"Alcohol use behaviors among pharmacy students.","abstract":"To identify reasons for drinking, determine the patterns of alcohol abuse, and explore relationships between drinking motives and alcohol abuse patterns in pharmacy students.A cross-sectional anonymous, voluntary, self-administered paper survey instrument was administered to first-year (P1) through third-year (P3) pharmacy students as part of a professional seminar.Survey instruments were completed by 349 pharmacy students (95.9% cooperation rate). Using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test criteria, 23.2% of students reported hazardous or harmful use and 67.2% of students reported consuming alcohol at hazardous levels during the past year. Students who were male (37.0%), single (25.3%), and attended the main campus (26.2%) were more likely than their counterparts to report hazardous or harmful alcohol use. Pharmacy students reported social motives as the most common reason for drinking; however, coping and enhancement motives were more predictive of harmful or hazardous alcohol use.Approximately 1 in 4 pharmacy students (23%) reported hazardous or harmful alcohol use. Education about the dangers of alcohol abuse and intervention programs from colleges and schools of pharmacy are recommended to help address this issue.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672063","annotations":[{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.663049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.530041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.485378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.362855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.312234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.197811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Campus","weight":0.176375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus"},{"name":"College","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.0721111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Anonymity","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_Use_Disorders_Identification_Test"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Pharmacy school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy_school"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Seminar","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminar"},{"name":"Test preparation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_preparation"}]}
