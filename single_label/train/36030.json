{"id":36030,"title":"High maternal serum estradiol environment in the first trimester is associated with the increased risk of small-for-gestational-age birth.","abstract":"There are increasing concerns that a disrupted endocrine environment may disturb the growth of the fetus. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) situates gamete/embryo in a supraphysiological estradiol (E2) environment and, thus, provides an ideal model to investigate this problem.Our objective was to investigate whether the maternal high-E2 environment in the first trimester increases the risks of low birth weight (LBW) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth.In total, 8869 singletons born after fresh embryo transfer (ET) (n = 2610), frozen ET (n = 1039), and natural conception (NC) (n = 5220) and their mothers were included. Birth weight, LBW, SGA, and maternal serum E2 levels were investigated.The mean serum E2 levels of women undergoing fresh ET at 4 and 8 weeks of gestation were significantly higher than those of the women undergoing frozen ET and the women with NC (P < .01). Serum E2 levels of women undergoing fresh ET at 4 and 8 weeks of gestation were positively correlated to those on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration (r = 0.5 and r = 0.4, respectively; P < 0.01). The birth weight after fresh ET was significantly lower than that after frozen ET and NC (P < 0.01), with increased incidence of LBW and SGA (P < .05). Furthermore, in the fresh ET group, singletons of mothers with high E2 levels (?10460 pmol/L on the day of hCG administration) had higher risks of LBW (P < .01) and SGA (P < .01) than those with low E2 levels, and maternal serum E2 level on the day of hCG administration negatively correlated with the birth weight (P < .01).The maternal high-E2 environment in the first trimester is correlated with increased risks of LBW and SGA. Evaluation of serum E2 before ET should be adopted to reduce the possibility of high E2 exposure to gamete/embryo.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606075","annotations":[{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Embryo transfer","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_transfer"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.853119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.816008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.697067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.622106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Reproductive technology","weight":0.612904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.588784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.529777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.436777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.0481626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0369874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
