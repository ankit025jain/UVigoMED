{"id":50718,"title":"Cerebral microvascular lesions on high-resolution 7-Tesla MRI in patients with type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"Cerebral small vessel disease, including microvascular lesions, is considered to play an important role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-associated cognitive deficits. With ultra-high field MRI, microvascular lesions (e.g., microinfarcts and microbleeds) can now be visualized in vivo. For the current study, 48 nondemented older individuals with T2DM (mean age 70.3 Â± 4.1 years) and 49 age-, sex-, and education-matched control subjects underwent a 7-Tesla brain MRI scan and a detailed cognitive assessment. The occurrence of cortical microinfarcts and cerebral microbleeds was assessed on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T1-weighted and T2*-weighted images, respectively, compared between the groups, and related to cognitive performance. Microinfarcts were found in 38% of control subjects and 48% of patients with T2DM. Microbleeds were present in 41% of control subjects and 33% of patients (all P > 0.05). The presence and number of microinfarcts or microbleeds were unrelated to cognitive performance. This study showed that microvascular brain lesions on ultra-high field MRI are not significantly more common in well-controlled patients with T2DM than in control subjects.
