{"id":87438,"title":"[Biomechanical study on a net-fixation of Kirschner wire in treating depressed tibial plateau fractures].","abstract":"To evaluate the biomechanical properties of tibial plateau depressed fracture fixed with a net-fixation of Kirschner wires.Twenty homemade fracture models were fixed with eight 1.5 mm Kirschner wires in a net-fixation; 20 homemade fracture models were fixed with two 3.5 mm cortical screws. Plane-compressed and dot-compressed test were made on each 10 models of the two groups. The maximal force of anti-ompress and stiffness were measured and evaluated.In plane-compressed test,mean maximal force of anti-compress and stiffness for screw fixation was (1,925.31 +/- 444.26) N and (2.28 +/- 0.53) N/mm2, respectively, for net-fixation was (1,609.62 +/- 277.72) N and (1.90 +/- 0.33) N/mm2, respectively. There was no statistical difference between the two fixation methods (P > 0.05). In dot-compressed test,mean maximal force of anti-compress and stiffness for screw fixation was (411.13 +/- 233.88) N and (2.66 +/- 1.52) N/mm2,respectively,for net-fixation was (1,105.58 +/- 290.66) N and (7.18 +/- 1.89) N/mm2,respectively,the net-fixation was better than that of the screw fixation (P< 0.01).Treatment of tibial plateau depressed fracture with a net-fixation of Kirschner wires is a biological fixation and is a reliably method.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167675","annotations":[{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.454152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Depression (mood)","weight":0.232302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.20711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.189465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.115541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0317028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Kirschner wire","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirschner_wire"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"277","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/277"},{"name":"925","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/925"},{"name":"TRS connector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_connector"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Marc Kirschner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Kirschner"},{"name":"233 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/233_(number)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
