{"id":88988,"title":"Closed soft tissue extensor mechanism injuries (mallet, boutonniere, and sagittal band).","abstract":"The extensor mechanism of the hand is complex and can be disrupted at several different points, from hand trauma. This article summarizes current concepts relating to the presentation and treatment of closed soft tissue injuries of the extensor mechanism in zones I, III, and V, commonly known as mallet finger and boutonniere deformities and sagittal band injuries.
