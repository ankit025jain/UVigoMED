{"id":33515,"title":"Anatomical vascular variations and practical implications for access creation on the upper limb.","abstract":"A profound knowledge of vascular anatomy and an understanding of vascular access functionality with respect to possible complications are critical in selecting the site for arteriovenous anastomosis.Outline of vasculature variations of the upper limb with prevalence reported in literature of at least 1%, which may affect access creation, is depicted in this review.Over a dozen arterial anatomical anomalies of the upper limb, the most common is \"high origin\" of the radial artery (12-20%). Superficial positions of brachial, ulnar and radial artery as well as accessory brachial are another possible anatomic variants (0.5-7%). The most variable venous layout on the upper arm is seen in the anatomy of the brachial vein and the basilic vein forming the axillary vein. Three types of basilic vein course on upper arm have been described.The mapping technique to assess vascular variants facilitate site selection for AVF creation even in cases with previously attempted failed access (misdiagnosed vascular variant could force to secondary options). Thus, a thorough understanding and evaluation of anatomy, taking into consideration the possible vascular variations of the forearm and upper arm, are necessary in the planning of AVF creation and increase the success of AVF procedures.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24817459","annotations":[{"name":"Radial artery","weight":0.90346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_artery"},{"name":"Basilic vein","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilic_vein"},{"name":"Axillary vein","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_vein"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Brachial veins","weight":0.810198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_veins"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Brachial artery","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_artery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Ulnar artery","weight":0.736088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_artery"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.59143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Accessory nerve","weight":0.500909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessory_nerve"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.263635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.261876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Axillary nerve","weight":0.124353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_nerve"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.113719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Circulatory anastomosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_anastomosis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
