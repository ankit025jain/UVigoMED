{"id":4275,"title":"[Influence of occupational factors on the bone and joint functional state in the upper extremities and cervical spine in female workers of clothing manufacture].","abstract":"The studies using multiple X-ray methods covered influence of complex containing working process and occupational environment factors on locomotory apparatus of upper limbs and cervical spine in female seamers engaged into various productions. Comparative analysis involved results of regular (standard X-ray) and special X-ray methods (stereoroentgenography, high definition roentgenography, roentgen densitometry, roentgenogrammetry) in 370 examinees with early and moderate clinical symptoms of occupationally mediated diseases of the stated areas. X-ray studies of locomotory apparatus of upper limbs and cervical spine in clothing manufacture workers, with special diagnostic methods, enabled to determine incidence and severity of functional and structural changes more reliably than via standard examination. The changes revealed were assigned mostly in \"early\" and \"moderate\" categories and matched with occupational peculiarities of the workers examined.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282801","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.719996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.659376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.655988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.341876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.182633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.142562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Clothing","weight":0.1201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"},{"name":"Animal locomotion","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_locomotion"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Densitometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Densitometry"},{"name":"High-definition television","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"370","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/370"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Fast bowling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Standardized test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Meat on the bone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_on_the_bone"}]}
