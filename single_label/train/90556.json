{"id":90556,"title":"[Caregivers of individuals with spinal cord injury: caregiver burden].","abstract":"A sectional study that had as its objectives to assess caregiver burden of for caregivers of individuals with Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury (TSCI) and its association with sociodemographic variables (age and sex), health status (self-reported illnesses) and caregiver characteristics (care time in years and daily hours of care). Data were collected by consultation of patient files and individual interviews at home using the instrument, Caregiver Burden Scale (CBScale). The results showed that most burden occurred in the domains: environment, disappointment and general strain. Presenting health problem (for all domains of the CBScale) and spending more hours per day in care (in the domain disappointment) represented the variables associated with burden. Studies of a more confirmatory nature than exploratory between the variables studied can be used to measure the burden obtained in this population of caregivers of individuals with TSCI.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601136","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.684279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.55762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.321621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.194585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.158256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Computer file","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Rope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Strain (injury)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(injury)"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Legal burden of proof","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
