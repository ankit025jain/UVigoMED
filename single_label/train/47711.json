{"id":47711,"title":"Evaluation of specific fecal protein biochips for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer.","abstract":"To develop and initially test a potential fecal protein biochip for the screening of colorectal cancer (CRC).Fecal protein from 20 colorectal cancer patients and 20 healthy controls were extracted from all of the fecal samples and screened for proteomic differences using a Biotin label-based protein array. Candidate proteins were then verified by ELISA. Finally, we will select out the significant protein and a seven-target multiplex fecal protein biochip was generated and tested for 20 fecal samples to determine the effectiveness of the biochip on identifying CRC. And the value of the protein biochip would be discussed.After tested by protein biochip of the fecal protein from 20 colorectal cancer patients and 20 healthy controls and levels of calprotectin, M2-pyruvatekinase, angiopoietin-2, fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase, thrombopoietin (TPO) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) were significantly different between CRC and healthy controls. The sensitivity of all the seven proteins combined was 0.7, specificity was 0.4, and area under the receiver operating characteristics was 0.729. The most promising combinations of test proteins were FGF-23, TPO, and IL-13, reaching a sensitivity of 0.7 and a specificity of 0.7. The combination of FGF-23 and TPO scored highest with sensitivity of 0.7 and specificity of 0.8. Its mean that the combination of FGF-23 and TPO has the highest value for the diagnosis of CRC in our study.A protein biochip composed of proteins found to be elevated in the feces of colorectal cancer patients has great potential as a noninvasive diagnostic for colorectal cancer. The addition of new protein biomarkers and technologies, as they are discovered, is an excellent avenue of future research.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574808","annotations":[{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.910935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Thrombopoietin","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombopoietin"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biotin","weight":0.800917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.740782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Proteomics","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.452711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.427891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Interleukin 13","weight":0.391579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_13"},{"name":"Angiopoietin","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiopoietin"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Biochip","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochip"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor 23","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor_23"},{"name":"Protein microarray","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_microarray"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Array data structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Cyclic redundancy check","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Multiplex (assay)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_(assay)"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Thyroid peroxidase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_peroxidase"}]}
