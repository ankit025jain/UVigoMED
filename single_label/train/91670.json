{"id":91670,"title":"Rapid chondrolysis of the knee after partial lateral meniscectomy in professional athletes.","abstract":"Postoperative knee joint chondrolysis is a rare but serious complication. The aim of our study is to report the clinical presentation, the early, mid and long-term outcomes of rapid chondrolysis after a partial lateral meniscectomy in elite athletes.Clinical records of 10 consecutive cases of rapid chondrolysis after partial lateral meniscectomy in eight professional athletes were retrospectively reviewed. There were seven males and one female with a mean age of 25.2 years (range 20-32 years) at index procedure. An initial conservative approach to its treatment was attempted in all cases. Arthroscopic lavage was advocated in two cases. Patients were clinically reviewed at last follow-up with comparative X-rays, a subjective IKDC, a Lysholm and Tegner scale.All patients resumed their pre-injury level of activity at a mean 8 (±2.45) months after the index procedure. At a mean of 82 (±36) months of follow-up, the mean subjective IKDC, Lyshom and Tegner scale were respectively 82.64 (±8.61), 86.6 (±6.44), 9 (±1.41). All knees demonstrated joint space narrowing scored Kellgren and Lawrence II (n=1) III (n=4) or IV (n=5) on conventional radiographs.By reviewing the common factors in each of these cases we believe that rapid chondrolysis occurs primarily due to the excessive loading of the articular cartilage in the lateral compartment of the knee. In this series, although the results in the medium term were good, the long-term outcome must be guarded due to the high rate of radiographic osteoarthritis of the lateral compartment seen in this population.Retrospective case series, Level IV.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485090","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.788683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.688377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.486572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Arthroscopic lavage","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopic_lavage"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.271842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.125189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0682477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"2032","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2032"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Johan Henric Kellgren","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Henric_Kellgren"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Twin-screw type supercharger","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-screw_type_supercharger"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Professional sports","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Elite","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite"},{"name":"Lateral compartment of leg","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_compartment_of_leg"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
