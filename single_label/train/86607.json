{"id":86607,"title":"[The question and analysis about maintenance therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer].","abstract":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Recently, several studies have been carried about maintenance therapy in non-small cell lung cancer, and some chemotherapy agents have been approved for clinical practice. But there are still a lot of questions about maintenance therapy that we have to consider. For example, the defects of design in maintenance therapy trials; how to choose gold standard of maintenance therapy for evaluation; who benefit from the maintenance therapy and how to estimate pharmaceutical economics. In this paper, we will make deep analysis about these issues.
