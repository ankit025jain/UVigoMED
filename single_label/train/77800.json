{"id":77800,"title":"Putting newborn hearing screening on the political agenda in Belgium: local initiatives toward a community programme - a qualitative study.","abstract":"The Kingdon model, based on the convergence of three streams (problem, policy, and politics) and the opening of a policy window, analyses the process by which a health issue is placed on the political agenda. We used this model to document the political agenda-setting process of the newborn hearing screening programme in Belgium.A qualitative study based on a document review and on semi-directed interviews was carried out. The interviews were conducted with nine people who had played a role in putting the issue in question on the political agenda, and the documents reviewed included scientific literature and internal reports and publications from the newborn hearing screening programme. The thematic analysis of the data collected was carried out on the basis of the Kingdon model's three streams.The political agenda-setting of this screening programme was based on many factors. The problem stream included factors external to the context under study, such as the technological developments and the contribution of the scientific literature which led to the recommendation to provide newborn hearing screening. The two other streams (policy and politics) covered factors internal to the Belgian context. The fact that it was locally feasible with financial support, the network of doctors convinced of the need for newborn hearing screening, the drafting of various proposals, and the search for financing were all part of the policy stream. The Belgian political context and the policy opportunities concerning preventive medicine were identified as significant factors in the third stream. When these three streams converged, a policy window opened, allowing newborn hearing screening onto the political agenda and enabling the policy decision for its introduction.The advantage of applying the Kingdon model in our approach was the ability to demonstrate the political agenda-setting process, using the three streams. This made it possible to identify the many factors involved in the process. However, the roles of the stakeholders and of the context were somewhat inexplicit in this model.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986647","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Politics","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"},{"name":"Belgium","weight":0.676719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.631653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.330914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.287979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Scientific literature","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.111671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Stakeholder (corporate)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)"},{"name":"Technical drawing","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_drawing"},{"name":"Third stream","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_stream"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Stream","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Manifesto","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto"},{"name":"Politics of Belgium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Belgium"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Post-hoc analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-hoc_analysis"},{"name":"Window","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window"},{"name":"Convergent evolution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution"},{"name":"Concentration of media ownership","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Political agenda","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_agenda"},{"name":"Document review","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_review"}]}
