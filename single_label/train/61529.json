{"id":61529,"title":"Current Phase II antibody-drug conjugates for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.","abstract":"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are mAb attached to biologically active drugs through specialized chemical linkers with labile bonds. They deliver the cytotoxic agent and release it at the tumor with limited systemic exposure.In this review, the authors summarize and discuss antibody conjugates in Phase II clinical trials in lymphoid malignancies. Furthermore, the article gives a critical overview of Phase II clinical trials of these therapies.ADCs have increased selectivity and a longer half-life in comparison to systemic chemotherapy. These agents improve the potency of chemotherapy by increasing the accumulation of the cytotoxic drug within neoplastic cells with reduced systemic effects. Improvements in cytotoxin selection and the use of partial antibodies have further improved the clinical value of ADCs. Newer ADCs currently in Phase II clinical trials show promise as treatments for several lymphoid malignancies, especially lymphoma, multiple myeloma and lymphoid leukemia. In the near future, the addition of ADCs to the armamentarium of anticancer drugs should offer novel and more targeted treatment strategies.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708159","annotations":[{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.837674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.771688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.743415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.730262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.599962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.587655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.459226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Covalent bond","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Pseudobulbar affect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudobulbar_affect"}]}
