{"id":79116,"title":"[Expression and significance of lymphocytes in chronic rhinosinusitis].","abstract":"To investigate the B lymphocytes(CD20) and T-lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8) expression and clinical significance in chronic rhinosinusitis.Immunohistochemical technique was applied to detect the expression of the B lymphocytes (CD20), helper T lymphocytes (CD4) and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CD8) in 15 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps group (CRSsNP). 12 patients of chronic nasal sinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP), 7 cases of recurrent CRSwNP group and 13 patients with inferior turbinate mucosa in the control group. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze CD)20, CD4 and CD8 between the experimental groups and the control group. One- Way ANOVA was used to compare the lymphocyte infiltration between the experiment groups.Patients with CRS had higher infiltration of the B lymphocytes (CD20) and T lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD88) than the patients of the control group (P < 0.05). The expression of T lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8) in CRSwNP and recurrent CRSwNP groups was significantly higher than in CRSsNP (P < 0.05). The expression of CD4 in the recurrent CRSwNP group was obviously higher than that in CRSsNP and CRSwNP (P < 0.01).The B lymphocytes, helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells have the high expression in CRS groups, which involved with the formation of inflammation. Furthermore nasal polyps are closely related to T lymphocyte infiltration.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490292","annotations":[{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.899663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.888726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"CD20","weight":0.761432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD20"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.684297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Polyp","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.200516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.119705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Nasal concha","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_concha"},{"name":"Nasal polyp","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_polyp"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
