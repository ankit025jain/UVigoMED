{"id":53324,"title":"Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of thyroid nodules: does size matter?","abstract":"Some authors have questioned the benefit of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules ? 4 cm. They report that the results of the FNA are not as reliable when compared to nodules <4 cm. The aims of this study are to evaluate the accuracy and predictive values of ultrasound-guided FNA (USFNA) of thyroid nodules ? 4 cm and compare these findings to nodules <4 cm.A retrospective study of 998 patients who underwent thyroid surgery between 2006 and 2012 at the McGill University Thyroid Cancer Center was performed. USFNA and post-operative pathology diagnoses of nodules ? 4 cm versus those <4 cm were compared. Pre-operative USFNA results were divided into three groups: benign, indeterminate, and malignant/suspicious for malignancy subgroups. Post-operative results were separated into benign and malignant groups.There were 225 patients with nodules ? 4 cm and 773 patients with nodules <4 cm. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for USFNA of nodules ? 4 cm were 84.62% (CI 71.91-93.10), 91.49% (CI 79.6-97.58), 91.67% (CI 80.0-97.63) and 84.31% (CI 71.4-92.95), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for USFNA of nodules <4 cm were 90.48% (CI 86.1-93.8), 85.92% (CI 75.6-93.02), 95.8% (CI 92.41-97.96) and 71.76% (CI 60.95-81.0), respectively. The difference in diagnostic accuracy of USFNA between both groups was not statistically significant (p>0.05).This study shows that the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for USFNA of nodules ? 4 cm are similar to that of smaller nodules. It is therefore suggested that these nodules undergo USFNA.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524916","annotations":[{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.861677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.730257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.646062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"McGill University","weight":0.606015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.601157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.521206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.496351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.282956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.276491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.192612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.17827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"697","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/697"},{"name":"998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/998"},{"name":"225","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/225"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Thyroid nodule","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_nodule"}]}
