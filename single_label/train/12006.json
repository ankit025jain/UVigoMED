{"id":12006,"title":"The application of a duplex reverse transcription real-time PCR for the surveillance of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and porcine circovirus type 2.","abstract":"The porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is the most common disease in commercial pork production worldwide. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), the most important agents of PRDC, usually co-infect in the same pigs. In order to survey the prevalence of PCV2 and PRRSV in pigs of various ages, a duplex reverse transcription real-time PCR (DRT-rPCR) was developed and applied in the present study. The DRT-rPCR did not cross-react with 10 swine viruses other than PCV2 and PRRSV, with detection limits of 1 TCID50/ml for PCV2 and 6.3 TCID50/ml for PRRSV. Surveillance using DRT-rPCR together with serology revealed that in the five farms studied, pigs were most susceptible to PRRSV at 6-14 weeks of age, whereas susceptibility to PCV2 varied by the management system but was mostly at 10-14 weeks of age. Cross analysis of viral loads versus antibody titers revealed that PCV2 load was affected negatively by anti-PCV2 ORF2 antibody, which constituted the most important non-infectious factor affecting the development of PMWS. These results indicated that DRT-rPCR was developed and applied successfully to the surveillance of PCV2 and PRRSV in the field.
