{"id":82571,"title":"Molar heights and incisor inclinations in adults with Class II and Class III skeletal open-bite malocclusions.","abstract":"The aim of this research was to compare maxillary and mandibular molar heights and incisor inclinations in patients with skeletal open-bite Class II, patients with skeletal open-bite Class III, and an untreated control group.Pretreatment lateral cephalograms of 70 orthodontic patients (34 men, 36 women) between 16 and 40 years of age were examined. The sample was divided into 3 groups according to facial growth pattern and overbite. The control group (n = 25) included normodivergent Class I subjects with adequate overbite; the skeletal open-bite Class II group (n = 25) and the skeletal open-bite Class III group (n = 20) included hyperdivergent Class II or Class III subjects with negative overbite. Measurements considered were ANB angle, palatal and mandibular plane angles, maxillary incisor palatal plane angulation, and mandibular incisor mandibular plane angulation, as well as the distance from the palatal or the mandibular plane to the mesial cusp of the molars. Multivariate analysis of covariance and multivariate analysis of variance tests were used to determine the differences between the groups, followed by the Tukey post-hoc test. Additionally, the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskall-Wallis test were performed.Significant differences in molar height were found (P <0.001). A 4-mm difference in maxillary molar height between the skeletal open-bite and control groups was found. Mandibular molar height was greater in the skeletal open-bite Class II group (P <0.001). Maxillary incisor palatal plane angulation was greater in the skeletal open-bite Class III group by approximately 6°. Mandibular incisor to mandibular plane angulation was 10° more lingual in the skeletal open-bite Class III group (P <0.001).The skeletal open-bite groups had greater molar heights than did the control group. The skeletal open-bite Class II group had more eruption of the mandibular molars. The maxillary incisors were more proclined and the mandibular incisors were more lingual in the skeletal open-bite Class III group.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582024","annotations":[{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.837923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.684078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.648341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.647415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.560982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.30668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.253518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.20625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Tooth eruption","weight":0.122184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_eruption"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.0700838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Analysis of covariance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_covariance"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"John Tukey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey"},{"name":"TV Asahi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Asahi"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Covariance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Tetragonal crystal system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragonal_crystal_system"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"},{"name":"Classes of United States Senators","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_of_United_States_Senators"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 4","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_4"}]}
