{"id":46498,"title":"Systematic review and meta-analysis of rectal washout on risk of local recurrence for cancer.","abstract":"It has been shown that intraluminal washout (WO) can prevent local recurrence (LR) of rectal cancer. This meta-analysis was to evaluate the association of rectal WO and the risk of LR after anterior resection in patients with rectal cancer.The relevant studies were identified by a search of the MEDLINE, Embase, Wiley Online Library, and Cochrane Oral Health Group Specialized Register with no restrictions on October 18, 2013, and these studies were included in a systematic review and meta-analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated in fixed effects model.A total of nine studies were included in our study, yielding a total of 5519 patients, and pooled ORs for overall LR in corresponding subgroups were calculated. Rectal WO was associated with a lower risk for LR (240/4176, 5.75% versus 9.75%, 131/1343, OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.42-0.68, and P < 0.00001) in patients with anterior resection, having total mesorectal excisions (234/3942, 5.93% versus 9.34%, 97/1039, OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.46-0.75, and P < 0.00001), and after radical resection (RR; 122/2665, 4.99% versus 8.90%, 74/831, OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.41-0.78, and P = 0.0005), with an overall LR rate of 6.72% (371/5519). But, the stability of RRs is not high in the total mesorectal excisions or RR subgroup by sensitivity analysis.The use of rectal WO decreases risks of LR in patients after anterior resection of cancer.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630520","annotations":[{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.781434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.595181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.563836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.377822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.357647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.238135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.193233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Fixed effects model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_effects_model"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Wiley Online Library","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiley_Online_Library"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Sensitivity analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"John Wiley & Sons","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_&_Sons"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"October 18","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_18"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"410","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/410"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Specialized Bicycle Components","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialized_Bicycle_Components"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Washout (aviation)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washout_(aviation)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
