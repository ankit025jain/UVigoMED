{"id":88197,"title":"Contralateral extradural hematoma following decompressive craniectomy for acute subdural hematoma (the value of intracranial pressure monitoring): a case report.","abstract":"Decompressive surgery for acute subdural hematoma leading to contralateral extradural hematoma is an uncommon event with only few cases previously reported in the English medical literature.The present study describes the case of a 39-year-old White Brazilian man who had a motorcycle accident; he underwent decompressive craniectomy for the treatment of acute subdural hematoma and evolved contralateral extradural hematoma following surgery.The present case highlights the importance of close monitoring of the intracranial pressure of severe traumatic brain injury, even after decompressive procedures, because of the possible development of contralateral extradural hematoma.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886310","annotations":[{"name":"Subdural hematoma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdural_hematoma"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.875066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Intracranial pressure","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_pressure"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.662126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.6301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.594819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.505498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Epidural hematoma","weight":0.478737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural_hematoma"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.360731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Decompressive craniectomy","weight":0.202918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompressive_craniectomy"},{"name":"Motorcycle","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.1487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0623561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Medical literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_literature"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"England","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"}]}
