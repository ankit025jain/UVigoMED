{"id":76581,"title":"[Bone metabolism and cardiovascular function Update. Vascular calcification as a manifestation of bone-vascular axis].","abstract":"Vascular calcification is the major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and in aging patients. Regardless of the morphology and location, most evidence indicates that vascular calcification involves an organized process recapitulating many cellular and molecular events that govern skeletal bone formation. While the large body of evidence that osteoblastic and osteochondrocytic cells contribute to vascular calcification, it remains unclear how osteoclasts are differentiated from their precursors and how osteoclasts play a role in calcium reabsorption in calcifying arteries. It is reassuring that calcium paradox is not merely due to the calcium shift from bone to artery wall, but is likely due to the differential response of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts to oxidative stress between bone and artery. To date, many studies have highlighted the important role for RANK/RANKL/OPG axis as unifying theme for the apparently opposite regulation of calcification between two tissues.
