{"id":55030,"title":"Meta-analysis of stratus OCT glaucoma diagnostic accuracy.","abstract":"To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of glaucoma in different stages, different types of glaucoma, and different ethnic groups using Stratus optical coherence tomography (OCT).We searched MEDLINE to identify available articles on diagnostic accuracy of glaucoma published between January 2004 and December 2011. A PubMed (National Center for Biotechnology Information) search using medical subject headings and keywords was executed using the following terms: \"diagnostic accuracy\" or \"receiver operator characteristic\" or \"area under curve\" or \"AUC\" and \"Stratus OCT\" and \"glaucoma.\" The search was subsequently limited to publications in English. The area under a receiver operator characteristic (AUC) curve was used to measure the diagnostic performance. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled AUC value of the 17 parameters (average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, temporal quadrant, superior quadrant, nasal quadrant, inferior quadrant, and 1 to 12 o'clock). Meta-regression analysis was used to check the significance of some important factors: (1) glaucoma severity (five stages), (2) glaucoma types (four types), and (3) ethnicity (four categories).The orders of accuracy among those parameters were as follows: average > inferior > superior > 7 o'clock > 6 o'clock > 11 o'clock > 12 o'clock > 1 o'clock > 5 o'clock > nasal > temporal > 2 o'clock > 10 o'clock > 8 o'clock > 9 o'clock > 4 o'clock > 3 o'clock. After adjusting for the effects of age, glaucoma severity, glaucoma types, and ethnicity, the average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness provided highest accuracy compared with the other parameters of OCT. The diagnostic accuracy in Asian populations was significantly lower than that in whites and the other two ethnic types.Stratus OCT demonstrated good diagnostic capability in differentiating glaucomatous from normal eyes. However, we should be more cautious in applying this instrument in Asian groups in glaucoma management.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Eye
