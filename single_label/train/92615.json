{"id":92615,"title":"Regulatory T cells in vitiligo: Implications for pathogenesis and therapeutics.","abstract":"Vitiligo is a hypomelanotic autoimmune skin disease arising from a breakdown in immunological self-tolerance, which leads to aberrant immune responses against melanocytes. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are crucial to the development of self-tolerance and so are major foci in the study of autoimmune pathogenesis of vitiligo. This review will summarise recent findings concerning the role of Tregs in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. In addition, as antigen-specific Tregs are a potential route for the reinstatement of immune tolerance, new strategies that expand or induce de novo generation of Tregs and which are currently being investigated as therapies for other autoimmune diseases, will be discussed. These approaches will highlight the opportunities for Treg cell-based therapeutics in vitiligo.","date":"2015-01-22","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308528","annotations":[{"name":"Vitiligo","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immune tolerance","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_tolerance"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.735016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.734351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.702154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Melanocyte","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.68884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.667406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.617411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.284565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"}]}
