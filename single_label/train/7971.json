{"id":7971,"title":"Reconstruction of artery wall in experimental giant aneurysms.","abstract":"This study describes five experimental techniques for the surgical treatment of giant aneurysms based on the resection of the aneurysm sac and reconstruction of the arterial wall.The aneurysm was realized with a venous graft implanted with end-to-side anastomosis on the common carotid artery on 50 rabbits (with each technique realized in 10 rabbits). The first two experimental techniques (A and B) involve the reconstruction of the artery wall by a synthetic dural patch and by direct suture reinforced by a venous patch, respectively. In the model C a collateral branch arising from the aneurysm is resected and reimplanted on the parent artery after aneurysm resection. In the experimental model D the arterial defect is closed by a venous patch surrounding the whole arterial wall and sutured with the aid of fibrin glue. In the model E clamping of the parent artery proximal to the aneurysm site and termino-lateral anastomosis with the contralateral artery lead to the thrombosis of the aneurysm fulled only by refluent flow.The venous pouch experimental models are useful to realize giant aneurysms. The above described techniques allow to realize the reconstruction of the arterial wall without stenosis and shortening the clamping time.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819487","annotations":[{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Dura mater","weight":0.785161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura_mater"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fibrin glue","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin_glue"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.120224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0606567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.0247819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Patch (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Wheel clamp","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_clamp"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Oke","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oke"},{"name":"Fulling","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulling"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Collateral (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)"}]}
