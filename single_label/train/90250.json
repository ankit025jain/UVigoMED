{"id":90250,"title":"Emergent treatment of button batteries in the esophagus: evolution of management and need for close second-look esophagoscopy.","abstract":"The evolving epidemiology of pediatric button battery ingestion is alarming. Currently, assessment of the degree of damage relies heavily on the initial esophagoscopy in a manner similar to the management of caustic ingestion. We have noted that use of this classic approach may delay the return to normal oral intake. Using several cases treated at our institution, we illustrate the value of \"close second-look esophagoscopy\" (CSLE) in expediting a return to normal oral intake after button battery ingestion.We present a retrospective case series.Five patients (11 to 18 months of age) with button batteries trapped in the cervical esophagus were recently managed at our institution. The batteries were lodged in the esophagus for durations ranging from 6 hours to 4 months. Three cases of initial grade III circumferential necrotic injury were downgraded to grade IIa after a CSLE performed 2 to 4 days after removal, and their management was appropriately changed.The injury and healing of cases of button batteries in the proximal esophagus appear to be variable; caustic injury, electrical mucosal damage, and direct pressure are thought to be several contributory factors. Performing a CSLE within 2 to 4 days after battery removal may provide more useful prognostic information. In certain cases, downgrading of the injury may facilitate an earlier return to an oral diet, use of fewer diagnostic tests, and a shorter hospital stay. The utility and timing of imaging, management of diet and medications, and acceptable follow-up plans are discussed within the context of guiding future research.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24633947","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.775927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.641329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.545423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.487247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.482994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.470534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.284081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.268384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.263573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.217298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.214742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Corrosive substance","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosive_substance"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0995937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"}]}
