{"id":79585,"title":"Echinococcosis and cysticercosis in Poland in 2012.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to assess the epidemiological situation of echinococcosis and cysticercosis in 2012 as compared to previous years.The assessment of the epidemiological situation was based on data contained in the individual reports on cases sent to the Department of Epidemiology NIPH-NIH by the Regional Sanitary- Epidemiological Stations and on the pooled data published in the annual bulletin \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland\".In 2012, the total number of reported cases of echinococcosis in Poland was 28. This included: 11 undefined cases (39% of all cases), 7 alveolar echinococcosis cases (41% out of l7 cases in which the species of Echinococcus was recognized) and 10 cystic echinococcosis (59% of all defined cases). The total incidence of echinococcosis was 0.073/100 000. Cases were registered in 8 provinces. Most cases (9) and the highest incidence (0.620) was recorded in Warmi?sko-Mazurskie. Echinococcus infections were reported in people aged 15 to 82 years, mostly adults (mean age 49.2 years, median 54.0). Echinococcosis was more frequent among women (incidence 0.096) than among men (incidence 0.048). The incidence of echinococcosis in rural areas was higher than in the city (0.125 vs. 0.039). Cysticercosis, which occurs sporadically in Poland, was not reported in 2012.For the purposes of epidemiological surveillance it would be advisable to introduce the obligatory differentiation of alveococcosis and hydatidosis, as well as a case definition for cysticercosis. In order to reduce the risk of contracting tapeworm infections, it is advisable to intensify educational efforts.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135515","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.354609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Lead poisoning","weight":0.290671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.285879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Cestoda","weight":0.268791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cestoda"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Echinococcus","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.133635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Cysticercosis","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysticercosis"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"Epidemiological surveillance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiological_surveillance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"1 myriametre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_myriametre"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Provinces and territories of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Well-definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-definition"},{"name":"Provinces of Kenya","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Kenya"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"}]}
