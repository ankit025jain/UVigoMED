{"id":86645,"title":"DNA copy number changes in tumors within the spectrum of cellular, atypical, and metastasizing fibrous histiocytoma.","abstract":"Cutaneous fibrous histiocytoma (FH) is a common mesenchymal neoplasm. Metastasis is rare, disproportionately occurring among the aneurysmal, cellular, atypical, and deep variants.We determined whether DNA copy number changes occurred in atypical FH (AFH), and whether they were similar to those in metastasizing FH (MetFH) and benign cellular FH (CFH).Five primary tumors of MetFH were evaluated by array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis, with tissue from local recurrences and lung metastases in 2 and 2 patients, respectively. Seven indolent AFH and 5 CFH were identified for comparison.Substantial differences between the groups were found both in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations (higher among MetFH and absent or solitary in CFH) and array-based comparative genomic hybridization profiles (frequent gains of 7 and 8q and losses of Xq in MetFH; recurrent losses of chromosomes 9 and 22 in AFH; isolated loss of 5q and gain in chromosome 20 in 2 CFH). Fatal MetFH cases (2 of 5 cases) exhibited the highest rate of chromosomal aberrations.This study included a small sample size with a short-term follow-up.Benign CFH, indolent AFH, and MetFH represent distinct biological entities within the spectrum of FH; array-based comparative genomic hybridization may be a tool in recognizing FH cases with metastatic potential and increasingly aggressive behavior.","date":"2014-07-19","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755122","annotations":[{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.721216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.668233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Comparative genomic hybridization","weight":0.537999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_genomic_hybridization"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Chromosome 20 (human)","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_20_(human)"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.286987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.275484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.241231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Chromosome 9 (human)","weight":0.211186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_9_(human)"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.154465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Factor H","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_H"}]}
