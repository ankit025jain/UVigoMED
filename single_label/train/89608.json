{"id":89608,"title":"Real-time measurements of endogenous carbon monoxide production in isolated pig lungs.","abstract":"Ischemia-reperfusion injuries are a critical determinant of lung transplantation success. The endogenous production of carbon monoxide (CO) is triggered by ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Our aim was, therefore, to assess the feasibility of exhaled CO measurements during the ex vivo evaluation of lungs submitted to ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Five pigs were euthanized and their lungs removed after pneumoplegia. After cold storage (30 min, 4°C), the lungs were connected to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit, slowly warmed-up, and ventilated. At the end of a 45-min steady state, CO measurements were performed by optical-feedback cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy, a specific laser-based technique for noninvasive and real-time low gas concentration measurements. Exhaled CO concentration from isolated lungs reached 0.45±0.19??ppmv and was above CO concentration in ambient air and in medical gas. CO variations peaked during the expiratory phase. Changes in CO concentration in ambient air did not alter CO concentrations in isolated lungs. Exhaled CO level was also found to be uncorrelated to heme oxygenase (HO-1) gene expression. These results confirm the feasibility of accurate and real-time CO measurement in isolated lungs. The presented technology could help establishing the exhaled CO concentration as a biomarker of ischemia-reperfusion injury in ex vivo lung perfusion.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Wounds and
