{"id":6444,"title":"Effect of parenteral administration of selenium and vitamin E on health status of mammary gland and on selected antioxidant indexes in blood of dairy cows.","abstract":"This study focuses on the effect of parenteral administration of Selenium (Se) and vitamin E on concentration of Se in plasma and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the blood of dairy cows during peripartal period and their effect on the reduction of clinical mastitis. From a 220 individuals Holstein herd in a two-four lactation-gestation cycle the control group (C), 1st (D1) and 2nd (D2) experimental group were selected. Every group consisted of 15 cows in the last phase of the pregnancy. All cows were fed with the diet containing 0.1 mg of Se per kg/DM. The blood samples from vena jugularis were collected approximately 21 days before calving (control sampling), 3 days, 12 days and 21 days after calving. On the day of control sampling and 12 days before calving in D1 group, cows were injected subcutaneously in the sprescapular region with preparation Selevit inj. a.u.v. at the doses of 48.4 mg/head of Se, and 550 IU/head of alpha-Tocoferol (alpha-Toc). In D2 group, cows were injected by the same preparation only on 21th day before calving with the same doses of Se and alpha-Toc. The increase in the concentration of Se in the plasma and activity GPx in blood in D1 group on the 3rd day and 12th day after calving were determined. Increase in plasmatic concentrations alpha-Toc on 3rd day after calving and reduction of occurrence of clinical mastitis (13.3%) as compared with control group were found.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24988846","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Selenium","weight":0.848438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.794133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.784752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Mastitis","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastitis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.701504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.671336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.590478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.554162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Glutathione peroxidase","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.42759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.239412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.224639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.169347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.144869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.117415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Dairy cattle","weight":0.0375893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Dairy","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"}]}
