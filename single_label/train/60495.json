{"id":60495,"title":"Predictors of allogeneic blood transfusion in total hip and knee arthroplasty in the United States, 2000-2009.","abstract":"We examined the predictors of allogeneic blood transfusion (ALBT) in primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), analyzing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2000 and 2009. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. Significant predictors of ALBT in both THA and TKA included older age, female gender, race, weight loss, anemia, Elixhauser Comorbidity Score, hospital caseload, hospital region, and insurance status. No autologous-related blood transfusion was a significant predictor of ALBT in THA, however, not in TKA. We believe that the utilization of ALBT in THA and TKA can decrease by taking these factors into consideration for patient blood management before surgery.
