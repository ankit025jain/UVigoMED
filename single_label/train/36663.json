{"id":36663,"title":"The cavus foot.","abstract":"The cavus, or high-arched, foot can present in either childhood or adulthood as a function of muscle imbalance. Neurologic, traumatic, and idiopathic processes have been identified, along with residual clubfoot, as the primary causes of adult cavus foot deformity. A thorough history and physical examination is important and can help identify the underlying cause of deformity. Conservative treatment modalities are always used first, with surgical intervention reserved for refractory cases. The goal of surgery is to correct muscle imbalance, which can be achieved via tendon transfers, corrective osteotomies, and, in the most severe cases, fusion.
