{"id":62256,"title":"PRAME gene expression in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: impact on prognosis.","abstract":"The PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma) gene is frequently overexpressed in a wide variety of malignant diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute B-cell malignancies.To study the expression of PRAME gene and clarify its prognostic impact on disease outcome.Screening for PRAME gene expression was assessed using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 55 pretreated ALL bone marrow samples.PRAME positivity was found in 14 (31.3%) of 45 patients. No significant correlation could be observed between PRAME expression and clinical characteristics. Positive PRAME expressers had a statistically higher CR (p = 0.001), lower relapse (p = 0.02), lower mortality (p < 0.001), a trend towards lower Refractory disease (p = 0.10), and a statistically longer DFS and OS (p < 0.001, < 0.001, respectively) in comparison to negative PRAME expressers.Our results suggested that PRAME was a predictor for better outcome, could be a useful target for immunotherapy, and might represent a candidate marker for the monitoring of minimal residual disease.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600975","annotations":[{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.89313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Reverse transcriptase","weight":0.76965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.758867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.636935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.634172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.467419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"}]}
