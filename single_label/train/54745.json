{"id":54745,"title":"Retinal layer measurements after successful macula-off retinal detachment repair using optical coherence tomography.","abstract":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to analyze the thickness of various retinal layers of patients following successful macula-off retinal detachment (RD) repair.Optical coherence tomography scans of patients after successful macula-off RD repair were reanalyzed with a subsegmentation algorithm to measure various retinal layers. Regression analysis was performed to correlate time after surgery with changes in layer thickness. In addition, patients were divided in two groups. Group 1 had a follow-up period after surgery of up to 7 weeks (range, 21-49 days). In group 2, the follow-up period was >8 weeks (range, 60-438 days). Findings were compared to a group of age-matched healthy controls.Correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between inner nuclear-outer plexiform layer (INL-OPL) thickness and time after surgery (P=0.0212; r2=0.1551). Similar results were found for the ellipsoid zone-retinal pigment epithelium complex (EZ-RPE) thickness (P=0.005; r2=0.2215). Ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness (GCL-IPL) was negatively correlated with time after surgery (P=0.0064; r2=0.2101). For group comparison, the retinal nerve fiber layer in both groups was thicker compared to controls. The GCL-IPL showed significant thinning in group 2. The outer nuclear layer was significantly thinner in groups 1 and 2 compared to controls. The EZ-RPE complex was significantly thinner in groups 1 and 2 compared to controls. In addition, values in group 1 were significantly thinner than in group 2.Optical coherence tomography retinal layer thickness measurements after successful macular-off RD repair revealed time-dependent thickness changes. Inner nuclear-outer plexiform layer thickness and EZ-RPE thickness was positively correlated with time after surgery. Ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness was negatively correlated with time after surgery.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25190655","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.657039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.464644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.40717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.401444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Ellipsoid","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.351493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.329146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.30687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Outer nuclear layer","weight":0.123079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_nuclear_layer"},{"name":"Axon","weight":0.0646211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon"},{"name":"Nerve fiber layer","weight":0.0639325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_fiber_layer"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"1551","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1551"},{"name":"23rd century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23rd_century_BC"},{"name":"Dietitian","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian"},{"name":"Thinning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinning"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"2140s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2140s"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
