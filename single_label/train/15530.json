{"id":15530,"title":"Evaluation of six PCR assays in combination with patient related data for the diagnosis of Clostridium difficile-associated infections.","abstract":"The aim of this multicenter study was to establish a diagnostic algorithm using molecular methods for the diagnosis of C. difficile-associated infection (CDI). In addition patient specific data were taken into consideration for the interpretation of the results.We compared the performance of six different commercially available PCR-tests, two toxin immunoassays, and a glutamat-dehydrogenase test by analysing liquid stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI. Toxigenic culture on CLO-agar was used as reference method.In total 250 stool specimens were collected at two study sites. 77 (30.8%) stool samples were culture-positive for toxigenic C. difficile. 173 (69.2%) specimens showed no growth of C. difficile. As a result, each of the PCR assays tested for C. difficile had a significantly higher sensitivity (94.8% - 100%) and NPV (97.6% - 100%) than the TOX-EIA with a sensitivity of 57.1% and NPV of 83.8%. Specificity of the PCR tests was 94.1% to 96.0% and PPV between 86.5% and 91.6%. The analysis of the patient data revealed a significant difference (p-value 0.0202) between toxin-positive and toxin-negative patients regarding prior antibiotic treatment, especially for cephalosporins.Our findings support the recommendation to restrict the use of antibiotics as a cornerstone in the prevention of CDI. We conclude that all of the PCR assays evaluated in this study can be applied in a diagnostic algorithm.","date":"2014-09-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25185420","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.781072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.647546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.47573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.47519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.441833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.280064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.253725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.215948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.208685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.182304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.121499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Pay-per-view","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Interpretation (logic)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_(logic)"},{"name":"National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_for_the_Development_of_Indigenous_Peoples"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Medical algorithm","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_algorithm"},{"name":"Cornerstone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Net present value","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value"}]}
