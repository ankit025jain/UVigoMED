{"id":80028,"title":"[Establishment of policy indicators of adaptation to the impact of climate change on the transmission of schistosomiasis and malaria in China].","abstract":"To set up a framework of indicators for schistosomiasis and malaria to guide the formulation and evaluation of vector-borne disease control policies focusing on adaptation to the negative impact of climate change.A 2-level indicator framework was set up on the basis of literature review, and Delphi method was applied to a total of 22 and 19 experts working on schistosomiasis and malaria, respectively. The result was analyzed to calculate the weight of various indicators.A total of 41 questionnaires was delivered, and 38 with valid response (92.7%). The system included 4 indicators at first level, i.e. surveillance, scientific research, disease control and intervention, and adaptation capacity building, with 25 indicators for schistosomiasis and 21 for malaria at the second level. Among indicators at the first level, disease surveillance ranked first with a weight of 0.32. Among the indicators at the second level, vector monitoring scored the highest in terms of both schistosomiasis and malaria.The indicators set up by Delphi method are practical,universal and effective ones using in the field, which is also useful to technically support the establishment of adaptation to climate change in the field of public health.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818407","annotations":[{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.68361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.609406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Climate","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.475564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.239972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.224923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.157662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Capacity building","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_building"},{"name":"Effects of global warming","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Disease surveillance","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_surveillance"},{"name":"Adaptation to global warming","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_to_global_warming"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Delphi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi"},{"name":"Delphi method","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Universal health care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Conceptual framework","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework"},{"name":"The Establishment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Establishment"},{"name":"Liga de Honra","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liga_de_Honra"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 2","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_2"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
