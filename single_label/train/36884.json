{"id":36884,"title":"Management of bleeding uterine arteriovenous malformation with bilateral uterine artery embolization.","abstract":"To evaluate the technical feasibility and clinical outcome of bilateral uterine artery embolization (UAE) as a first-line therapeutic option for bleeding uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM).Between 2002 and 2012, 19 patients were diagnosed with acquired uterine AVM clinically and through imaging studies. The clinical characteristics, angiographic features, technical success rate of embolization, procedure-related complications, imaging, and clinical follow-up data were assessed. Clinical success was defined as immediate symptomatic resolution with disappearance of vascular abnormality on subsequent imaging studies.A total of 20 bilateral UAE, with or without embolization of extra-uterine feeders, were performed as the first-line treatment. Technical and clinical success rate was 90.0% (18/20) and 89.5% (17/19), respectively. Embolization was incomplete in two patients who had residual extra-uterine fine feeders to the AVM or a procedure- related complication (ruptured uterine artery); the former showed slow regression of the vascular malformation during the observation period, while the latter underwent a successful second bilateral UAE. Immediate clinical success was achieved in the remaining 17 patients after a single session and no recurrence of bleeding was found. Recovery to normal menstrual cycle was seen in all 17 patients with clinical success within one or two months, two of whom subsequently had uneventful intrauterine pregnancies carried to term.Bilateral UAE is a safe and effective first-line therapeutic option for the management of bleeding uterine AVMs. However, incomplete embolization due to unembolizable feeders or difficult access into the uterine artery may lead to suboptimal treatment.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532505","annotations":[{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.932247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.784616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.773461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.696813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Uterine artery","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_artery"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.159322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.107822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.079334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"United Arab Emirates","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates"},{"name":"Vascular malformation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_malformation"},{"name":"Uterine artery embolization","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_artery_embolization"},{"name":"1820","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1820"},{"name":"1719","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1719"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Immediate Records","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_Records"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Recovery (Eminem album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_(Eminem_album)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Pareto efficiency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
