{"id":18235,"title":"Tuneable resolution as a systems biology approach for multi-scale, multi-compartment computational models.","abstract":"The use of multi-scale mathematical and computational models to study complex biological processes is becoming increasingly productive. Multi-scale models span a range of spatial and/or temporal scales and can encompass multi-compartment (e.g., multi-organ) models. Modeling advances are enabling virtual experiments to explore and answer questions that are problematic to address in the wet-lab. Wet-lab experimental technologies now allow scientists to observe, measure, record, and analyze experiments focusing on different system aspects at a variety of biological scales. We need the technical ability to mirror that same flexibility in virtual experiments using multi-scale models. Here we present a new approach, tuneable resolution, which can begin providing that flexibility. Tuneable resolution involves fine- or coarse-graining existing multi-scale models at the user's discretion, allowing adjustment of the level of resolution specific to a question, an experiment, or a scale of interest. Tuneable resolution expands options for revising and validating mechanistic multi-scale models, can extend the longevity of multi-scale models, and may increase computational efficiency. The tuneable resolution approach can be applied to many model types, including differential equation, agent-based, and hybrid models. We demonstrate our tuneable resolution ideas with examples relevant to infectious disease modeling, illustrating key principles at work.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24810243","annotations":[{"name":"Time","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.734476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Systems biology","weight":0.69991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology"},{"name":"Scientist","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Differential equation","weight":0.675823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.626514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.279976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.127776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Mirror","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0778537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Temporal scales","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_scales"},{"name":"Wet laboratory","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_laboratory"},{"name":"Productivity","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Longevity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological process","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_process"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Algorithmic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Virtual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Span (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_(architecture)"},{"name":"Discretion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretion"},{"name":"Flexibility (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexibility_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Fine art","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art"},{"name":"Connectionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism"},{"name":"Business process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"}]}
