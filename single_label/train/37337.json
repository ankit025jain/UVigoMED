{"id":37337,"title":"Efficacy of treatment with oral alitretinoin in patient suffering from lichen simplex chronicus and severe atopic dermatitis of hands.","abstract":"Lichen simplex chronicus (LSC) is a skin disorder characterized by chronic itching and scratching, which can lead to thick, leathery, brownish skin, sometimes with papules and can be associated with atopic eczema. We report the case of a 52-year-old man with a 45-year atopic condition and presenting LSC in his dorsum. After a 3-month treatment with alitretinoin at the daily dosage of 30?mg, we have observed a moderate improvement of the hand eczema together with a substantial clinical improvement of LSC and an almost complete resolution of pruritus. We want to report this peculiar case to suggest the use of oral alitretinoin for LSC.
