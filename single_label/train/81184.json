{"id":81184,"title":"Six-mm versus 10-mm long implants in the rehabilitation of posterior edentulous jaws: a 5-year follow-up of a randomised controlled trial.","abstract":"To compare the clinical outcome of 6-mm and 10-mm long implants in partially edentulous posterior areas.Twenty-four patients, with a partially edentulous area in the jaws with a height and width allowing the positioning of 2 to 3 adjacent 10 × 4.1 mm implants without any augmentation procedure, were randomly allocated according to a parallel group design to receive 6-mm long or 10-mm long implants. A total of 54 implants were placed (26 × 6 mm and 28 × 10 mm implants). Patients were restored 8 weeks after surgery and were followed for 5 years. Outcome measures were prosthesis and implant survival, as well as marginal bone level changes and complications.After 5 years, 18 patients were available. One 6 mm implant failed during the healing period and its related prosthesis could not be placed. No implants were lost after loading. The 6 mm group registered 5 complications (1 mucositis, 3 prosthesis decementations and 1 chipping), while only 3 were registered in the 10 mm group (2 decementations and 1 chipping). The difference in complications between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.39). Marginal bone loss at 5 years was 0.43 and 0.24 mm with the 6 mm and 10 mm groups, respectively (not statistically significant; difference between the two groups 0.19 mm; SD 0.23 mm; 95% CI -0.34;0.73; t test P = 0.42).Implant and prosthetic survival and success rates were similar between prostheses supported by 6-mm or 10-mm long implants.","date":"2014-11-25","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25422825","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.820656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.674499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.443093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.430164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.404846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Mucositis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucositis"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Image registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration"},{"name":"Marginal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Parallel (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry)"},{"name":"10mm Auto","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10mm_Auto"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
