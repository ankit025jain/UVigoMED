{"id":50977,"title":"Urine bile acids relate to glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a body mass index below 30 kg/m2.","abstract":"Bile acids are important endocrine signalling molecules, modulating glucose homeostasis through activation of cell surface and nuclear receptors. Bile acid metabolism is altered in type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, whether this is of pathogenic consequence is not fully established. In this study urinary bile acid excretion in individuals with type 2 diabetes and matched healthy volunteers was assessed. Urinary bile acid excretion in type 2 diabetes patients was considered in the context of prevailing glycaemia and the patient body mass index. Urine bile acids were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, allowing individual quantification of 15 bile acid species. Urinary bile acid excretion in patients with type 2 diabetes who were normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) and overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2) were elevated compared to healthy normal weight volunteers, both p<0.0001. In obese (BMI ? 30 kg/m2) type 2 diabetes patients, urinary bile acid excretion was significantly lower than in the normal and overweight type 2 diabetes groups (both p<0.01). Total bile acid excretion positively correlated with HbA1c in normal (rs=0.85, p=<0.001) and overweight (rs=0.61, p=0.02) but not obese type 2 diabetes patients (rs=-0.08, p=0.73). The glycaemia-associated increases in urine bile acid excretion in normal weight and overweight type 2 diabetes seen in this study may represent compensatory increases in bile acid signalling to maintain glucose homeostasis. As such alterations appear blunted by obesity; further investigation of weight-dependent effects of bile acid signalling on type 2 diabetes pathogenesis is warranted.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736330","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.836017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Bile acid","weight":0.829616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_acid"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.80736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.73916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.722842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.720865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.497615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.418729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.331511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.255994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.224841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.198152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.112458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"}]}
