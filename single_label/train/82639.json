{"id":82639,"title":"Protective benefits of a stabilised stannous-containing fluoride dentifrice against erosive acid damage.","abstract":"To assess the potential of a stabilised stannous (Sn)-containing NaF dentifrice (Oral B/blend-a-Med(®) Pro-Expert), in addition to a number of other marketed European dentifrices formulated with various fluoride actives and two control dentifrices, to protect enamel against erosive acid damage.Cores of human enamel (four per group) were soaked in pooled human saliva, and then treated with a 1:3 slurry (dentifrice:saliva) using a standardised in vitro erosion model (5-day cycling) that includes 10-minute challenges with 1% citric acid applied 60 minutes after each dentifrice treatment. Enamel surface loss was measured using transverse microradiography (TMR).Specimens treated with the Sn-containing NaF dentifrice showed 6.5 ?m of surface loss ± 1.2 (SEM), which was not significantly different (P < 0.05, Fisher LSD) from that of a clinically proven, stabilised SnF2 positive control [Crest(®) Pro-Health, 1,100 ppm F as SnF2 : 3.0 ?m of surface loss ± 1.1 (SEM)]. The Sn-containing NaF dentifrice and the clinically proven positive control both provided significantly greater protection (P < 0.05, Fisher LSD) compared with all of the other products tested. Enamel loss (SEM) values for other European products and the reference control (active agents) were: Meridol(®) : (1,400 ppm F as AmF + SnF2 ) 12.0 ?m (1.47); Colgate(®) Cavity Protection: (1,450 ppm F as SMFP + NaF) 12.9 ?m (1.66); Odol med 3(®) (1,400 ppm F as NaF) 14.2 ?m (1.49); Elmex(®) (1,400 ppm F as AmF) 14.5 ?m (1.76); Colgate(®) Enamel Protect: (1,450 ppm F as NaF + KNO3 ) 16.3 ?m (2.02); Lacalut(®) aktiv: (1,400 ppm F as AlF3 ) 18.5 ?m (1.71); Sensodyne(®) ProNamel(™) : (1,450 ppm F as NaF + KNO3 ) 20.5 ?m (1.26); Crest Cavity Protection (1,100 ppm F as NaF, reference control) 22.00 ?m (2.04); and Mentadent(®) : (1,450 ppm F as NaF + Zn citrate) 22.3 ?m (0.63).These results support the potential for the stabilised, Sn-containing NaF dentifrice to provide erosion protection benefits that are not significantly different from the positive control benchmark for erosion protection (stabilised SnF2 ), and are significantly better than a broad range of dentifrice formulations available on the European market.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Stomatognathic
