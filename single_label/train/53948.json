{"id":53948,"title":"Dimensions and morphologic variations of sella turcica in type 1 diabetic patients.","abstract":"Some chronic diseases are associated with changes in the morphology of sella turcica, and type 1 diabetes is the most common chronic disease in children and adolescents. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the size and morphology of sella turcica in patients with type 1 diabetes compared with a healthy control group.The study included 76 type 1 diabetic patients (38 boys, 38 girls; ages, 14.16 ± 2.46 years) and 76 controls (38 boys, 38 girls; ages, 14 ± 2.08 years). The groups were categorized as pubertal and postpubertal according to bone age. The length, height, and diameter of sella turcica were measured. Then the morphology of sella turcica was analyzed and categorized as normal, oblique anterior wall, bridging, double contour of the floor, irregularity in the posterior part of dorsum sellae, or pyramidal shape of the dorsum sellae. All measurements were made on tracings of cephalometric radiographs. Differences between the groups were tested with the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical data were evaluated with the Fisher exact test, and the Bonferroni correction was made. The significance level was assigned as P <0.05.There was no statistically significant difference in the dimensions of sella between the diabetic patients (diameter, 12.20 ± 1.49 mm; length, 10.49 ± 1.55 mm; height, 8.07 ± 1.25 mm) and the controls (diameter, 12.45 ± 1.43 mm; length, 10.90 ± 1.73 mm; height, 8.29 ± 1.66 mm). However, diameter and length increased with age in the overall assessment. Length was greater in the postpubertal controls (11.39 ± 1.69 mm) compared with the pubertal controls (10.41 ± 1.64 mm). Diameter was greater in the postpubertal diabetic patients (1.283 ± 1.55 mm) than in the pubertal diabetic patients (11.56 ± 1.12 mm) and was specifically higher in postpubertal boys. Normal sella morphology was less common in general in the diabetic patients, particularly in the diabetic boys and diabetic pubertal boys (P <0.05).The measurements concerning sella were similar in the type 1 diabetic and control subjects, but dysmorphologic types were more common in diabetic patients.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Endocrine System
