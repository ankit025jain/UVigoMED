{"id":43550,"title":"[Opportunities of computed tomographic colonography in detecting of colon neoplasms].","abstract":"The computed tomographic colonoscopy (CTC) was performed in 212 patients on the multislice computed tomography Siemens Open in low-dose mode during the period from 2010 to 2013. CTC was tolerated well by 80% of patients. 20% of patients complained of mild discomfort during the study. The optical colonoscopy with biopsy was done in 53 (25%) of 212 patients after CPC. This is due to the fact that it was not detected the significant endoluminal structures in other observations or small polyps were found in elderly patients. In these cases the risk of colonoscopy was not justified. Sensitivity and specificity of CTC was 55 and 91% respectively for the detection of polyps with diameter less than 5 mm; for polyps 5-9 mm - 85 and 93%; for polyps with diameter greater than 10 mm - 100 and 92%.
