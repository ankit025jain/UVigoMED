{"id":77609,"title":"[Laboratory animal allergy: follow-up in a research centre].","abstract":"Laboratory animal allergy (LAA) is frequent in exposed workers despite working conditions and exposure to these allergens having improved over the last decade. The aim of this study was to assess LAA in students and workers in a research facility within the framework of a prevention programme.Students and researchers working with laboratory animals underwent medical surveillance every year from 2001 to 2012. They filled in a standardized questionnaire for the assessment of allergic respiratory symptoms and exposure conditions. Skin prick tests with common allergens, latex and hair extract from laboratory animals were performed at the first control and after three years of exposure.198 women and 120 men with a mean age of 29.1 +/- 7.3 years and a work seniority of 3.1 +/- 6.5 years participated in the study. Sensitization to laboratory animals ranged between 11.8 and 14.8% according to work seniority. Sixteen subjects (5%) reported asthma and 25 (7.9%) rhinitis when working with laboratory animals. LAA was associated with the female gender (OR 3.1; IC 95% 2.3-5.8), with atopy by prick test (OR 7.0; IC 95% 2.9-16.9), and with sensitization to laboratory animals (OR 2.7; IC 95% 1.1-6.7).This study revealed a low level of sensitization and symptoms of allergy to laboratory animals as a result of the preventive measures adopted to reduce exposure, but there is nonetheless a need to improve prevention so as to completely avoid the onset of LAA in students and workers.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552092","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.832828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.794242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.760937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.578391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Latex","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.522637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.290881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.11264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Oregon Route 7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Route_7"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Seniority","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seniority"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim"},{"name":"Sensitization","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitization"}]}
