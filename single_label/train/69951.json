{"id":69951,"title":"Types of reactions to malignant disease in view of V.E. Frankl philosophy.","abstract":"The purpose of this work was to find out whether there is interdependence between the patients- assessments of biological, psychological, psychosocial and spiritual levels.590 subjects, both ill and healthy, were examined by appropriate means and asked to consider their level of fear, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Modification), aggression, quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire), and the purpose and meaning of life (The \"PURPOSE in Life Test\" - PIL questionnaire).Three groups of patients were established with the help of statistical procedures. The first group encompassed the healthy subjects, whereas the second and third included those that were ill. Although the subjects estimated their level of physical fitness and general quality of life similarly, there were some essential differences in their disease-associated reactions (i.e. the groups adjusted differently - the second group poorly and the third well). The majority of people suffering from cancer were well adapted to the early stages of the disease. As cancer progressed the percentage of those that adjusted poorly rose. However, even in the terminal stage some of the patients, about 1/3, still belonged to the group of those that were quite well adjusted. Established meaning of life, system of values, and personal religion were factors that helped to adapt.There was no connection between the patients' assessments of their biological level and other (psychological, psychosocial, spiritual) levels. We can distinguish groups of patients that judge their physical condition similarly and still vary in the assessment of their emotional state or meaning of life.","date":"2014-09-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25261670","annotations":[{"name":"Philosophy","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy"},{"name":"Spirituality","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Religion","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.737578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Meaning of life","weight":0.619534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.593459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.519534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.431578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.375564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.255017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.17827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Value system","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_system"},{"name":"Interdependence","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdependence"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Judge","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"State (polity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"}]}
