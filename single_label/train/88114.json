{"id":88114,"title":"Successful retrieval of broken coiled guidewire from left atrium during balloon mitral valvotomy: a rare complication.","abstract":"Abstract Balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV) is the procedure of choice for rheumatic mitral stenosis with favorable valve morphology. Fracture of 0.025 inch coiled guidewire during BMV is a very rare complication. The various factors which may cause this complication are utilization of reused hardware, improper placement of guidewire, abnormal angulation between guidewire and dilator with forceful septal dilation and rarely manufacturing defect. Here, we report successful retrieval of broken 0.025 inch coiled guidewire from left atrium during BMV using 10F Amplatzer long sheath without any complication.
