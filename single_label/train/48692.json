{"id":48692,"title":"(18)F-FDG PET/CT of adrenal lesions.","abstract":"The purpose of this review is to describe FDG uptake characteristics of adrenal lesions, which can show increased FDG uptake on PET/CT.Both benign and malignant adrenal lesions can show increased FDG uptake. Knowledge of the uptake characteristics of these lesions is helpful for increasing diagnostic accuracy and expanding the differential diagnosis for adrenal lesions.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055255","annotations":[{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.138084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
