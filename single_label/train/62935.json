{"id":62935,"title":"Proficiency testing results for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in north america.","abstract":"Between 2010 and 2012, North American Specialized Coagulation Laboratory Association (NASCOLA) distributed five proficiency testing challenges to evaluate laboratory testing for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Results (n = 355) were submitted from 43 unique laboratories for 10 samples (3 positive, 2 weak positive, and 5 negative). The vast majority of results were from commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods, predominantly polyvalent assays. Laboratories performed well in the classification of clear negative and positive samples. All results (100%) submitted for the five negative samples (n = 173) and 97% of immunological results submitted for the three positive samples (n = 105) were correctly classified (the incorrect responses were two borderline classifications and, from a gel-agglutination method, one negative classification). There was more difficulty in the classification of the two weak positive samples (n = 70). In one survey, 61% of results from the weak positive sample were classified as positive, while 21% were called negative, 16% were called borderline, and 2% were called inconclusive. In a second survey, 16% of results from the weak positive sample were called positive, while 56% were called negative, and 28% were called borderline. Significant interlaboratory variation was observed for ELISA results, with coefficients of variation of about 20 to 30%. We conclude that there is variability in HIT laboratory testing and that identification of weak positive samples can be challenging.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24497121","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.406674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.397784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.339644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.2352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.116553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Coefficient of variation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"355","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/355"},{"name":"Abbie Hoffman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbie_Hoffman"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Specialized Bicycle Components","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialized_Bicycle_Components"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Polyvalence","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvalence"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"2010 FIFA World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"}]}
