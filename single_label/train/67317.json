{"id":67317,"title":"A fluorescent alkyllysophospholipid analog exhibits selective cytotoxicity against the hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cell line PC3.","abstract":"A fluorescent analog of ET-18-OCH3, 1-O-(7'-N,N-dimethylamino-3'-pentadecanoyl-1'-naphthyl)-2-O-methyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine (1), was synthesized and its bioactivity was screened against 12 human cancer cell lines. The bioactivity of 1 was found to differ markedly from that of ET-18-OCH3. Growth of two prostate cell lines (PC3 and DU145) and a glioma cell line (U251) was significantly affected by 1, with IC50 values of 2, 6, and 12 ÂµM, respectively. Compound 1 was cytotoxic to PC3 cells by caspasedependent apoptosis. The subcellular distribution of 1 differed from that reported for a phenyl-polyene analog of ET-18-OCH3; 1 was found to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and lysosomes but not in the plasma membrane or nucleus of PC3 cells. However, no differences in accumulation of 1 were found between PC3 and cells that were not affected by the compound, implying that the selective PC3 cytotoxicity is a consequence of specific molecular components of PC3 cells.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628239","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.891758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.864089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.864015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.756404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Lysosome","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.729716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.715388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.713322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.663739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.509057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.282828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Naphthalene","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphthalene"},{"name":"DU145","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DU145"},{"name":"PC3","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC3"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Duke University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"}]}
