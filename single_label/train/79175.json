{"id":79175,"title":"Enhancement of the subtemporal approach by partial posterosuperior petrosectomy with hearing preservation.","abstract":"The microsurgical management of aneurysms in the interpeduncular and ambient cisterns remains challenging. The classic subtemporal approach has several limitations.To present a modification of this approach that allows for broader exposure with hearing preservation.We retrospectively reviewed our clinical database between August 2007 and February 2012 for all patients who underwent a modified subtemporal partial posterosuperior petrosectomy. Clinical data, complications, and postoperative head computed tomography (CT) scans were analyzed. Improvement in the angle of view acquired by the new approach was measured using the OsiriX 3-D rendering software and was compared with that obtained from the subtemporal approach. Similar methods were used to study improvement in the angle of view in head CT scans of randomly selected control patients.Five patients underwent a modified subtemporal approach for posterior circulation aneurysm clipping. All patients were women with a mean age of 49.8 years. Mean aneurysm size was 5.75 mm. Mean improvement in the angle of view was 17.52° in the study group (n = 5) and 11.7° in the control group (n = 10). Hearing was completely preserved in 3 patients. One patient had a subclinical conductive hearing loss, and 1 patient was not assessed formally at follow-up, but had no hearing concerns. No neurological sequelae were recorded.Our modified subtemporal approach appears to be safe and provides an increased angle of view with minimal additional operative time and with low risk to hearing. This approach may expand this surgical corridor and reduce the need for temporal lobe retraction.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
