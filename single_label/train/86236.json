{"id":86236,"title":"[Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast:report of 25 cases].","abstract":"To explore the clinical features, management approach and treatment outcomes for adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the breast.The clinicopathological data of 25 patients with breasts ACC treated in our hospital from years 1990 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed and their prognosis was analyzed.The median age of these 25 patients was 53 years (ranged from 31 to 81 years). With the exception of one male case, all patients were female including 17 cases of postmenopausal women. The most frequent presenting symptom is breast lumps, most (48.0%) were in the upper outer quadrant and areola area of the breast. Core needle biopsy was performed in five patients. The specimen finding were adenoids in three and invasive carcinoma in two cases. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed in 23 patients. Only two patients had histologically positive lymph nodes (3 of 14 and 2 of 20). Expression of ER and PR in 14 cases was detected by immunohistochemistry, showing one PR-positive and three ER-positive cases. The median follow-up of the 25 cases was 118 months (ranged from 12 to 244 months). Two patients died of lung metastases at 3 and 10 years after the surgery, respectively.Due to the complexity of the histology of ACC, adequate sampling of specimens is essential for accurate diagnosis. ACC of the breast is a rare disease with a relatively good prognosis. The low incidence of axillary lymph node metastasis suggests that axillary node dissection is not recommended as a routine procedure. Breast ACC are often with negative ER and PR expression, and the value of adjuvant therapy needs to be further investigated.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796466","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoid_cystic_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Axillary lymph nodes","weight":0.733987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pharyngeal tonsil","weight":0.717389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_tonsil"},{"name":"Areola","weight":0.703373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areola"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.655022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.643164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.632747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.567905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Postmenopausal","weight":0.438554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmenopausal"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.352485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.17947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.152005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"}]}
