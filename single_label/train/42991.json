{"id":42991,"title":"Toll like receptor 2 knock-out attenuates carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis by downregulating MAPK and NF-?B signaling pathways.","abstract":"Innate immune signaling associated with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is a key pathway involved in the progression of liver fibrosis. In this study, we reported that TLR2 is required for hepatic fibrogenesis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). After CCl4 treatment, TLR2(-/-) mice had reduced liver enzyme levels, diminished collagen deposition, decreased inflammatory infiltration and impaired activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) than wild type (WT) mice. Furthermore, after CCl4 treatment, TLR2(-/-) mice demonstrated downregulated expression of profibrotic and proinflammatory genes and impaired mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) activation than WT mice. Collectively, our data indicate that TLR2 deficiency protects against CCl4-induced liver fibrosis.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815695","annotations":[{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.77844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.713516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.678994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.678994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.661076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.648117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.643836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.569567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.525444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.521095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.514255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Carbon tetrachloride","weight":0.507659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.341109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.281229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"TLR 2","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR_2"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Kupffer cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kupffer_cell"},{"name":"Stellate cell","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellate_cell"}]}
