{"id":25720,"title":"[Postregistration study of comparative assessment efficacy of the use of fixed combination of nebivolol and amlodipine for the treatment of patients with moderate and high degree of arterial hypertension].","abstract":"of the study was to assess efficacy of the use of fixed combination of nebivolol and amlodipine in patients with moderate and high degree of arterial hypertension (AH).Patients with diagnosis of primary AH (n=124) were divided into 2 groups by random sample method. Patients of group 1 (n=62) received of fixed combination of nebivolol and amlodipine, while those of group 2 (n=62) received free combination of nebivolol and amlodipine. Study drugs were administered both as initial therapy and replacement of preceding treatment. Duration of observation was 3 months with visits after first 2 weeks and in 1, 2, and 3 months after enrollment.Starting from 2nd week visit of fixed combination of nebivolol and amlodipine treated patients had significantly lower levels of systolic and diastolic AP. Already after 2 weeks of combined two-component therapy 60% of group 1 and 52% of group 2 patients achieved target AP. Target AP was achieved by the end of month 1 by 86 and 71%, of month 2 - by 93 and 78% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively. In 3 months almost all patients had target AP, but in 1.6% of group 1 and 2.3% of group 2 patients this level was achieved after addition of a thiazide diuretic. Patients receiving of fixed combination of nebivolol and amlodipine achieved noromosyslolia more quickly compared with patients who received free combination of nebivolol and amlodipine.Combined therapy with fixed combination of nebivolol and amlodipine appears to be one of effective approaches to treatment of patients with moderate and high degree AH.","date":"2014-09-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25178073","annotations":[{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.629021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Thiazide","weight":0.442662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiazide"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Amlodipine","weight":0.328079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amlodipine"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nebivolol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebivolol"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Islamic calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Associated Press","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Nd (digraph)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nd_(digraph)"},{"name":"Random sample","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample"},{"name":"Target Corporation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
