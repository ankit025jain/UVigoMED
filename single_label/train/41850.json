{"id":41850,"title":"The 5-HT4 receptor agonist mosapride attenuates inflammation of reflux esophagitis.","abstract":"Chronic inflammatory processes and gastric contents related esophageal mucosal injury are two major characteristics of reflux esophagitis RE). This study was aimed to establish a rat model fitting RE major characteristics and to investigate the effects of mosapride, one of the 5-hydroxy tryptamine (5-HT)4 receptor agonists, on mucosal inflammation in RE.Rat RE model was established by pyloric clip and section ligation-induced chronic acid reflux esophagitis. Animal body weight and survival was monitored. Animals were treated with 0.1 mg/kg/d, 0.5 mg/kg/d, or 2.5 mg/kg/d mosapride by gavage. Gastric emptying was examined. After two weeks, pathological changes of the esophagus were determined and endothelin-1 (ED-1) expression in esophageal tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.No significant differences were observed in the gastric emptying of RE rats after different doses of mosapride treatment (P > 0.05). Gross examination and pathological evaluation revealed that either 0.5 mg/kg/d or 2.5 mg/kg/d mosapride treatment attenuated the mucosal inflammation of RE, but a lower mosapride dose (0.1 mg/kg/d) had limited esophagoprotective effects (P > 0.05). Mosapride treatment greatly decreased the number of ED-1 positive monocytes in the esophagus compared with sham-operated controls (P < 0.05). 5-HT4 receptor and acetylcholine (Ach) receptor antagonists effectively reversed the protective effects of mosapride (P < 0.05).Our results demonstrated that mosapride attenuated the mucosal inflammation of RE, suggesting that mosapride might provide esophagoprotective effects in addition to its well-known prokinetic actions.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24895805","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Acetylcholine","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine"},{"name":"Esophagitis","weight":0.796716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagitis"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.79151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Tryptamine","weight":0.743301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptamine"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.706392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Endothelin","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelin"},{"name":"Hydroxyl","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prokinetic agent","weight":0.53131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokinetic_agent"},{"name":"Pylorus","weight":0.515082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylorus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.501239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.400385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.35922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Mosapride","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosapride"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Gross examination","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_examination"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
