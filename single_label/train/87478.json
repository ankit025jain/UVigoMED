{"id":87478,"title":"Pitfalls in wrist and hand ultrasound.","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to review a number of diagnostic pitfalls related to ultrasound evaluation of the hand and wrist. Such pitfalls relate to evaluation of ten-dons (extensor retinaculum, multiple tendon fascicles, tendon subluxation), inflammatory arthritis (incomplete evaluation, misinterpretation of erosions, failure to evaluate for enthesitis), carpal tunnel syndrome (inaccurate measurements, postoperative assessment), ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb (misinterpretation of the adductor aponeurosis and displaced tear), wrist ganglion cysts (incomplete evaluation and misdiagnosis), and muscle variants.Although ultrasound has been shown to be an effective imaging method for assessment of many pathologic conditions of the wrist, knowledge of potential pitfalls is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and achieve high diagnostic accuracy.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25148155","annotations":[{"name":"Carpal tunnel syndrome","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Subluxation","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subluxation"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.784746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Thumb","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumb"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Adduction","weight":0.721419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduction"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Carpal tunnel","weight":0.650124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.454162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.449433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Ganglion cyst","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cyst"},{"name":"Aponeurosis","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aponeurosis"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.394913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.301781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.267898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Extensor retinaculum of the hand","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_retinaculum_of_the_hand"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_of_elbow_joint"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Ulnar artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_artery"}]}
