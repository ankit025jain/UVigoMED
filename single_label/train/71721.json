{"id":71721,"title":"Acute myeloid leukaemia with myelodysplastic features in children: a report of Japanese Paediatric Leukaemia/Lymphoma Study Group.","abstract":"The clinical characteristics and prognostic relevance of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with myelodysplastic features remains to be clarified in children. We prospectively examined 443 newly diagnosed patients in a multicentre clinical trial for paediatric de novo AML, and found 'AML with myelodysplasia-related changes' (AML-MRC) according to the 2008 World Health Organization classification in 93 (21·0%), in whom 59 were diagnosed from myelodysplasia-related cytogenetics alone, 28 from multilineage dysplasia alone and six from a combination of both. Compared with 111 patients with 'AML, not otherwise specified' (AML-NOS), patients with 'AML-MRC' presented at a younger age, with a lower white blood cell count, higher incidence of 20-30% bone marrow blasts, unfavourable cytogenetics and a lower frequency of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), NPM1 and CEBPA mutations. Complete remission rate and 3-year probability of event-free survival were significantly worse in 'AML-MRC' patients (67·7 vs. 85·6%, P < 0·01, 37·1% vs. 53·8%, P = 0·02, respectively), but 3-year overall survival and relapse-free survival were comparable with 'AML-NOS' patients. By multivariate analysis, FLT3-ITD was solely associated with worse overall survival. These results support the distinctive features of the category 'AML-MRC' even in children.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25039450","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"CD135","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD135"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.842836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.789811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"NPM1","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPM1"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.757568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.526917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"CEBPA","weight":0.441284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEBPA"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.164981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"2008 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Gene duplication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplication"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"}]}
