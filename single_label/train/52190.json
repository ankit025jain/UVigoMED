{"id":52190,"title":"Efficacy and safety of recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1-84) in hypoparathyroidism (REPLACE): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 3 study.","abstract":"Hypoparathyroidism results in impaired mineral homoeostasis, including hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia. Treatment with high-dose oral calcium and active vitamin D does not provide adequate or consistent control of biochemical indices and can lead to serious long-term complications. We aimed to test the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily recombinant human parathyroid hormone 1-84 (rhPTH[1-84]) in adults with hypoparathyroidism.Between June 23, 2009, and Feb 28, 2011, 134 eligible patients were recruited and randomly assigned to rhPTH(1-84) (n=90) or placebo (n=44). Six patients in the rhPTH(1-84) group and seven in the placebo group discontinued before study end. 48 (53%) patients in the rhPTH(1-84) group achieved the primary endpoint compared with one (2%) patient in the placebo group (percentage difference 51.1%, 95% CI 39.9-62.3; p<0.0001). The proportions of patients who had at least one adverse event were similar between groups (84 [93%] patients in the rhPTH[1-84] group vs 44 [100%] patients in the placebo group), with hypocalcaemia, muscle spasm, paraesthesias, headache, and nausea being the most common adverse events. The proportions of patients with serious adverse events were also similar between the rhPTH(1-84) group (ten [11%] patients) and the placebo group (four [9%] patients).50 ?g, 75 ?g, or 100 ?g per day of rhPTH(1-84), administered subcutaneously in the outpatient setting, is efficacious and well tolerated as a PTH replacement therapy for patients with hypoparathyroidism.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622413","annotations":[{"name":"Hypocalcaemia","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocalcaemia"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.829794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Paresthesia","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.741915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Spasm","weight":0.739911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.633963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.510532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.402331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Hypoparathyroidism","weight":0.114569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoparathyroidism"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Hyperphosphatemia","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperphosphatemia"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
