The percentage of detection of specific immunoglobulins was higher in \"ImmunoChip Borreliosis\" as compared with screening results in immune enzyme analysis. The high correlation between results of testing in immunochip and data of immune blotting is demonstrated to.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24757867","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.602805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.56601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.560335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Lyme disease","weight":0.143318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ixodes","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodes"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Radio format","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_format"},{"name":"Multiplexing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"}]}
