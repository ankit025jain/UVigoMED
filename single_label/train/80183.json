{"id":80183,"title":"Structures containing galectin-3 are recruited to the parasitophorous vacuole containing Trypanosoma cruzi in mouse peritoneal macrophages.","abstract":"Trypanosoma cruzi has a complex life cycle where the infective forms for the vertebrate host are trypomastigotes and amastigotes. Both forms invade and lyse their parasitophorous vacuole (PV) membrane, entering into the cytoplasm of its host cells. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a protein abundantly distributed in macrophages and epithelial cells. Previous studies demonstrated that Gal-3 binds to a 45KDa mucin of trypomastigotes surface, enhancing its adhesion to the extracellular matrix and even its entry into cells. Gal-3 has another novel cytoplasmic function recently described: a vacuole lyses marker in intracellular bacteria. Considering (1) the importance of Gal-3 during T. cruzi early infection and (2) the importance of T. cruzi PV lyses for parasite differentiation and replication, this study intended to explore a possible recruitment of structures containing Gal-3 (G3CSs) to T. cruzi PVs. Microscopy analyses showed these G3CSs around PVs after 30 and 90Â min of amastigotes and trypomastigotes infection, respectively. This recruitment was specific for T. cruzi PVs since we did not observe the same distribution at macrophages vacuoles containing fluorescent microspheres (FM). Concomitantly, this study intended to analyze the participation of actin cytoskeleton in T. cruzi PV maturation. We observed that actin filaments form a \"belt-like\" structure around trypomastigotes and amastigotes PVs, also labeled for Gal-3. At the time proposed for PV lysis, we observed an actin disassembling while LAMP-1 was recruited to PVs membrane. However, this pattern was maintained in macrophages derived from Gal-3 knockout mice, revealing that the actin belt structure forms independently from Gal-3. Taken together, these data suggest that G3CSs are recruited to vicinity of T. cruzi PV and that actin filaments localize and remain around T. cruzi PVs until the time of its lysis.
