{"id":34732,"title":"[Early prenatal diagnosis for a family affected with X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda family].","abstract":"X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (SEDL) is a rare osteochondrodysplasia caused by mutations of SEDL gene, which usually onset in late childhood without systemic complications. In this study, we have provided prenatal diagnosis for an affected family with a combined strategy including direct sequencing, fetal-sex identification and microsatellite linkage analysis.Two amniotic fluid samples from carrier gravida and 7 blood samples from individuals in this SEDL pedigree were obtained. Genomic DNA was extracted from the samples using standard phenol-chloroform method. SRY and AMEL genes were employed to assess fetal sex. Microsatellite DXS16 was genotyped for linkage analysis. A pathogenic mutation of the SEDL gene was identified by bi-directionally direct sequencing of the third exon as well as its exon/intron boundaries.Two male fetuses were confirmed by fetal-sex assessment. The mutation of the SEDL gene was identified as a nucleotide substitution of the splice acceptor site in intron 2, IVS2-2A>C. DNA sequencing indicated that one fetus is hemizygote carrying the mutation, whilst another is not a carrier. Linkage analysis was identical with the sequencing results. Follow-up also confirmed the result of prenatal diagnosis.Fetal-sex assessment combined with microsatellite linkage analysis and bi-directionally direct sequencing is a more accurate and ready strategy for prenatal diagnosis of families affected with SEDL.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24711020","annotations":[{"name":"Intron","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron"},{"name":"Zygosity","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"SRY","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRY"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.846149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Microsatellite (genetics)","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.751192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.723806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.71151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Pedigree chart","weight":0.709945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_chart"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.700895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Amniotic fluid","weight":0.695645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.672698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.391104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.3065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.263731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Electron acceptor","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_acceptor"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Glossary of terms associated with gravidity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_terms_associated_with_gravidity"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"}]}
