{"id":45470,"title":"Immune response to hepatitis B vaccine with high antigen content in non-responders after standard primary vaccination in Chinese adults.","abstract":"Alternative schedules are needed to provide greater immunogenicity in adults who fail to respond to the standard hepatitis B (HB) vaccine regimen.To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of high antigen content HB vaccine formulations administered to non-responders after routine primary vaccination.This was a phase III, double-blind, controlled clinical trial in China. We enrolled healthy participants (16-60 years old) seronegative for HB surface (HBs) antigen after primary vaccination, who had HBs antibody (anti-HBs) titres <10 mIU/ml at 28 days following routine vaccination with licensed HB vaccine containing 10 ?g of antigen. Participants were randomised (2:2:1) to receive three booster doses of HB vaccine formulations containing 60 ?g, 30 ?g or 10 ?g of antigen per dose 28 days apart. Blood samples were obtained pre-vaccination and 28 days after each dose to assess immunogenicity. Reactogenicity and safety were evaluated up to 28 days after each vaccine dose.Seroconversion rates were ? 92.1% and ? 87.1% as from the second dose of the 60 ?g and 30 ?g HB vaccine formulations, respectively, with geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of ? 286.0 mIU/ml and ? 164.0 mIU/ml. In the 10 ?g HB vaccine group the seroconversion rates were ? 83.0% and the GMCs ? 110.1 mIU/ml as from the second vaccine dose. All HB vaccine formulations were well tolerated: 352/1091 (32.3%) participants reported at least one injection-site or systemic adverse reaction (145/434 [33.4%] from the 60?g group; 138/435 [31.7%] from the 30 ?g group and 69/222 [31.1%] from the 10 ?g group). Most reactions were mild or moderate and resolved within 24h. No serious adverse events were reported.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681228","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.755699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.734939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"China","weight":0.707107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Hepatitis B vaccine","weight":0.687243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_vaccine"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.399254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.230623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"License","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Booster dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Oral contraceptive formulations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_contraceptive_formulations"},{"name":"Liberalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"}]}
