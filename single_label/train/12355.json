{"id":12355,"title":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition involved in pulmonary fibrosis induced by multi-walled carbon nanotubes via TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway.","abstract":"Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are a typical nanomaterial with a wide spectrum of commercial applications. Inhalation exposure to MWCNT has been linked with lung fibrosis and mesothelioma-like lesions commonly seen with asbestos. In this study, we examined the pulmonary fibrosis response to different length of MWCNT including short MWCNT (S-MWCNT, length=350-700nm) and long MWCNT (L-MWCNT, length=5-15?m) and investigated whether the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurred during MWCNT-induced pulmonary fibrosis. C57Bl/6J male mice were intratracheally instilled with S-MWCNT or L-WCNT by a single dose of 60?g per mouse, and the progress of pulmonary fibrosis was evaluated at 7, 28 and 56 days post-exposure. The in vivo data showed that only L-MWCNT increased collagen deposition and pulmonary fibrosis significantly, and approximately 20% of pro-surfactant protein-C positive epithelial cells transdifferentiated to fibroblasts at 56 days, suggesting the occurrence of EMT. In order to understand the mechanism, we used human pulmonary epithelial cell line A549 to investigate the role of TGF-?/p-Smad2 signaling pathway in EMT. Our results showed that L-MWCNT downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated ?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) protein expression in A549 cells. Taken together, both in vivo and in vitro study demonstrated that respiratory exposure to MWCNT induced length dependent pulmonary fibrosis and epithelial-derived fibroblasts via TGF-?/Smad pathway.
