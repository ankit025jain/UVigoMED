{"id":32110,"title":"Rapid and easy diagnosis of Netherton syndrome with dermoscopy.","abstract":"Netherton syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease demonstrating ichthyosis linearis circumflexa, atopic findings, and hair shaft anomalies. Trichorrhexis invaginata is the pathognomonic hair shaft anomaly seen in this syndrome.In recent years, hair shaft anomalies have been described as \"matchstick\" and \"golf tee\" signs. We present a patient with Netherton syndrome diagnosed by the presence of matchstick and golf tee hairs in addition to trichorrhexis invaginata.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25008447","annotations":[{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.830629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.779563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Autosomal recessive","weight":0.746651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_recessive"},{"name":"Ichthyosis","weight":0.596675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.44266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Ichthyosis linearis circumflexa","weight":0.438373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosis_linearis_circumflexa"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.370618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.244882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Netherton syndrome","weight":0.228889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherton_syndrome"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.157137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Pathognomonic","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathognomonic"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dermatoscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatoscopy"},{"name":"Golf","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.0248623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Tee","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee"},{"name":"Match","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match"},{"name":"Dicranopteris linearis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicranopteris_linearis"}]}
