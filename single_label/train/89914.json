{"id":89914,"title":"Role of alveolar macrophages in the inflammatory response after trauma.","abstract":"Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), can result from both direct and indirect pulmonary damage caused by trauma and shock. In the course of ALI/ARDS, mediators released from resident cells, such as alveolar macrophages, may act as chemoattractants for invading cells and stimulate local cells to build up a proinflammatory micromilieu. Depending on the trauma setting, the role of alveolar macrophages is differentially defined. This review focuses on alveolar macrophage function after blunt chest trauma, ischemia/reperfusion, hemorrhagic shock, and thermal burns.
