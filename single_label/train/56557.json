{"id":56557,"title":"Association study of newly identified age-related macular degeneration susceptible loci SOD2, MBP, and C8orf42 in Han Chinese population.","abstract":"A recent genome-wide association study has reported three newly identified susceptible loci (rs2842992 near the gene SOD2, rs1789110 near the gene MBP and rs722782 near the gene C8orf42) to be associated with the geographic atrophy subtype of age-related macular degeneration in European-descent population. We investigated the correlation between these variants and advanced age-related macular degeneration for the first time in a Han Chinese cohort; however, no evidence supports these previously identified loci contribute to advanced age-related macular degeneration susceptibility in Chinese population.
