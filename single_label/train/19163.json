{"id":19163,"title":"The impact of copper-containing and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptives on cervicovaginal cytology and microbiological flora: a prospective study.","abstract":"To compare vaginal microflora and cervical cytology before and after insertion of a copper-containing intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) or a levonorgestrel releasing-intrauterine system (LNG-IUS).Between April 2009 and February 2011, all women requesting insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive for family planning or noncontraceptive indications were enrolled. One hundred and eight Cu-IUDs and 42 LNG-IUSs were placed. Cervical cytological and vaginal microbiological findings before insertion and after 12 months were recorded.With regard to cervical cytology, nonspecific inflammatory changes became more frequent (but not significantly so; p = 0.062) after one year of use of a Cu-IUD, whereas their prevalence remained unchanged among women fitted with a LNG-IUS. Colonisation by Candida spp. and mycoplasma infections were diagnosed significantly more often after one year of use of the Cu-IUD than at baseline. During the study period, women wearing a Cu-IUD complained significantly more frequently of vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, and increased menstrual flow.Use of a Cu-IUD - but not that of a LNG-IUS - was associated with an alteration of the vaginal flora and showed a trend towards a higher frequency of nonspecific inflammatory changes affecting cervical cytology.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738915","annotations":[{"name":"Intrauterine device","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_device"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Levonorgestrel","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levonorgestrel"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Vaginal discharge","weight":0.660937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_discharge"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.660345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Family planning","weight":0.652371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning"},{"name":"Vaginal flora","weight":0.631922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_flora"},{"name":"Pelvic pain","weight":0.623701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_pain"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.593279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mycoplasma","weight":0.264178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.208685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.185206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.0988413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Urethral foreign body","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_foreign_body"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"}]}
