{"id":9901,"title":"Determination of location, size, and transmurality of chronic myocardial infarction without exogenous contrast media by using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T.","abstract":"Late-gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI (CMR) is a powerful method for characterizing myocardial infarction (MI), but the requisite gadolinium infusion is estimated to be contraindicated in ?20% of patients with MI because of end-stage chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether T1 CMR obtained without contrast agents at 3 T could be an alternative to LGE CMR for characterizing chronic MIs using a canine model of MI.Canines (n=29) underwent CMR at 7 days (acute MI [AMI]) and 4 months (chronic MI [CMI]) after MI. Infarct location, size, and transmurality measured by using native T1 maps and LGE images at 1.5 T and 3 T were compared. Resolution of edema between AMI and CMI was examined with T2 maps. T1 maps overestimated infarct size and transmurality relative to LGE images in AMI (P=0.016 and P=0.007, respectively), which was not observed in CMI (P=0.49 and P=0.81, respectively) at 3 T. T1 maps underestimated infarct size and transmurality relative to LGE images in AMI and CMI (P<0.001) at 1.5 T. Relative to the remote territories, T1 of the infarcted myocardium was increased in CMI and AMI (P<0.05), and T2 of the infarcted myocardium was increased in AMI (P<0.001) but not in CMI (P>0.20) at both field strengths. Histology showed extensive replacement fibrosis within the CMI territories. CMI detection sensitivity and specificity of T1 CMR at 3 T were 95% and 97%, respectively.Native T1 maps at 3 T can determine the location, size, and transmurality of CMI with high diagnostic accuracy. Patient studies are necessary for clinical translation.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682268","annotations":[{"name":"Gadolinium","weight":0.918121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadolinium"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.858235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.76635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.361358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.14369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Canidae","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canidae"}]}
