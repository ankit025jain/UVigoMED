{"id":3566,"title":"Tomosynthesis improves breast cancer detection: our experience.","abstract":"Breast tomosynthesis (BT) is a novel imaging technology in which an x-ray fan beam sweeps in an arc across the breast, producing tomographic images and it can reduce tissue overlap encountered in conventional two-dimensional (2D) and thus has the potential to improve detection of breast cancer and facilitate accurate differentiation of lesion types. The purpose of this article was to assess the positive predictive value (PPV) of breast cancer with BT versus full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and the assessment of detec- tion of both techniques in the present series.","date":"2015-01-05","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25556272","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Digital mammography","weight":0.643122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mammography"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.575283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.535138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.278226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.269103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0459885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Tomosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomosynthesis"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Pay-per-view","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Story arc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_arc"},{"name":"Beam (nautical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"BT Group","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Group"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Chimney sweep","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimney_sweep"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
