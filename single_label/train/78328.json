{"id":78328,"title":"Increased expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNA in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma.","abstract":"The increased expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNAs indicates that these pattern recognition receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma.Changes in expression of pattern recognition receptors may be associated with immune responses in patients with cholesteatoma. We therefore assessed the levels of expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNAs associated with innate immune responses in patients with cholesteatoma.Cholesteatoma specimens were collected from 23 patients diagnosed with acquired cholesteatoma from August 2010 to July 2012. The posterior auricular skin of each patient was used as control. The levels of expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNA were assessed quantitatively using real-time RT-PCR and correlated with sex, hearing level, the presence of bacteria, and the need for repeat surgery.The levels of expression of Dec-205, Bcl-10, Tim-3, and Trem-1 mRNAs were significantly higher in cholesteatoma than in control skin samples (p < 0.05 each). However, mRNA abundance was not associated with patient sex, hearing level, presence of bacteria or history of reoperation (p > 0.05 each).","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702227","annotations":[{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.721372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.605198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.463085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Pattern recognition receptor","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_receptor"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.319866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.309363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.281559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.113354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0553703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cholesteatoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesteatoma"},{"name":"Pattern recognition","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Stoichiometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry"},{"name":"Trem Desportivo Clube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trem_Desportivo_Clube"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Mexican general election, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_general_election,_2012"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
