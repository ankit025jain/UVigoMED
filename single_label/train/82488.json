{"id":82488,"title":"The alpha 7 nicotinic receptor agonist PHA-543613 hydrochloride inhibits Porphyromonas gingivalis-induced expression of interleukin-8 by oral keratinocytes.","abstract":"The alpha 7 nicotinic receptor (?7nAChR) is expressed by oral keratinocytes. ?7nAChR activation mediates anti-inflammatory responses. The objective of this study was to determine if ?7nAChR activation inhibited pathogen-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression by oral keratinocytes.Periodontal tissue expression of ?7nAChR was determined by real-time PCR. OKF6/TERT-2 oral keratinocytes were exposed to Porphyromonas gingivalis in the presence and absence of a ?7nAChR agonist (PHA-543613 hydrochloride) alone or after pre-exposure to a specific ?7nAChR antagonist (?-bungarotoxin). Interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression was measured by ELISA and real-time PCR. Phosphorylation of the NF-?B p65 subunit was determined using an NF-?B p65 profiler assay and STAT-3 activation by STAT-3 in-cell ELISA. The release of ACh from oral keratinocytes in response to P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide was determined using a GeneBLAzer M3 CHO-K1-bla cell reporter assay.Expression of ?7nAChR mRNA was elevated in diseased periodontal tissue. PHA-543613 hydrochloride inhibited P. gingivalis-induced expression of IL-8 at the transcriptional level. This effect was abolished when cells were pre-exposed to a specific ?7nAChR antagonist, ?-bungarotoxin. PHA-543613 hydrochloride downregulated NF-?B signalling through reduced phosphorylation of the NF-?B p65-subunit. In addition, PHA-543613 hydrochloride promoted STAT-3 signalling by maintenance of phosphorylation. Furthermore, oral keratinocytes upregulated ACh release in response to P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide.These data suggest that ?7nAChR plays a role in regulating the innate immune responses of oral keratinocytes.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24609617","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.872918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.796571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.77833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.768841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Keratinocyte","weight":0.703503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.644453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.528037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.426483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Acetylcholine","weight":0.211658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.17827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.130893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.10542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Telomerase reverse transcriptase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase_reverse_transcriptase"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"RELA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELA"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Hydrochloride","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloride"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
