{"id":81395,"title":"Bilateral cross-bite treated by repeated rapid maxillary expansions: a 17-year follow-up case.","abstract":"The objective of this paper is to show the clinical results after the repeated application of a Haas expander for rapid maxillary expansion (RME) anchored onto deciduous teeth in a 7-year-old patient that presented bilateral cross-bite, superior crowding and no space for permanent lateral incisors eruption.A first Haas expander was applied to the patient. She was told to activate it once a day, each activation was equal to 0.20 mm. After the first RME, the bilateral cross-bite was solved but still there was not enough space for lateral incisor eruption. A second and then a third Haas expander were applied, with the same activation protocol as the first one, in order to gain space in the anterior region and to achieve proper eruption of the lateral incisors. The patient was then treated with fixed appliances. At debonding the patient presented well aligned arch-forms: space for lateral incisor eruption was gained and superior crowding was solved. Bilateral cross-bite was also corrected. She was seen again 10 years and 17 years after expansions: she showed no relapse and presented a good functional occlusion that had remained stable, and an aesthetically pleasant smile, however she exhibited gingival recessions.Repeated rapid maxillary expansion, anchored onto deciduous teeth, performed in early mixed dentition represents a safe and successful treatment to correct severe bilateral cross- bites and to create space for maxillary incisor eruption.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25101496","annotations":[{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.908125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.682628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Deciduous teeth","weight":0.678215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_teeth"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.500501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.432167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.339873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.301695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Deciduous","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.18316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Maxillary lateral incisor","weight":0.0215009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_lateral_incisor"},{"name":"Types of volcanic eruptions","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0173619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Venom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Smile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Expansion pack","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_pack"},{"name":"Dental braces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"20 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Recession","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
