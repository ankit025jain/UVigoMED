{"id":30252,"title":"Neural and genetic correlates of binge drinking among college women.","abstract":"Ninety-seven female students were assigned to groups consisting of 55 infrequent and 42 frequent binge drinkers. The groups were compared on self-report measures of impulsivity, sensation seeking, and alexithymia, as well as several measures relevant to neural and genetic mechanisms, such as brain activation during a time estimation task and selected genotypes. Analyses of stimulus-locked brain activity revealed a slow cortical potential over the right parietal cortex during time estimation that was more negative among frequent binge drinkers. This group also showed a greater prevalence of a CHRM2 genotype previously associated with substance dependence and Major Depressive Disorder as well as a modest elevation on a non-planning impulsiveness scale. We conclude that the enhanced brain activation shown by binge drinkers compensates for an underlying deficit. That deficit may be reflected in poor planning skills and a genetic difference indicating increased risk for problems in later life.
