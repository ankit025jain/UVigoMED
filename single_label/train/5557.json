{"id":5557,"title":"Loss of mTOR-dependent macroautophagy causes autistic-like synaptic pruning deficits.","abstract":"Developmental alterations of excitatory synapses are implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Here, we report increased dendritic spine density with reduced developmental spine pruning in layer V pyramidal neurons in postmortem ASD temporal lobe. These spine deficits correlate with hyperactivated mTOR and impaired autophagy. In Tsc2 ± ASD mice where mTOR is constitutively overactive, we observed postnatal spine pruning defects, blockade of autophagy, and ASD-like social behaviors. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin corrected ASD-like behaviors and spine pruning defects in Tsc2 ± mice, but not in Atg7(CKO) neuronal autophagy-deficient mice or Tsc2 ± :Atg7(CKO) double mutants. Neuronal autophagy furthermore enabled spine elimination with no effects on spine formation. Our findings suggest that mTOR-regulated autophagy is required for developmental spine pruning, and activation of neuronal autophagy corrects synaptic pathology and social behavior deficits in ASD models with hyperactivated mTOR.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25155956","annotations":[{"name":"Dendritic spine","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_spine"},{"name":"Autism","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.840178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.801147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Chemical synapse","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synapse"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.703148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.627403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.44368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.404822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.338135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.330397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Pyramidal cell","weight":0.262776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramidal_cell"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.222903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.147222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.142562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.140579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Excitatory synapse","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_synapse"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Synaptic pruning","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_pruning"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Social behavior","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_behavior"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Excitatory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Spectrum (psychiatry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(psychiatry)"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Anosognosia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia"},{"name":"Secretory pathway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretory_pathway"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
