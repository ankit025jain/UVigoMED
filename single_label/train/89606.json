{"id":89606,"title":"Exploratory pilot study of driving perceptions among OIF/OEF Veterans with mTBI and PTSD.","abstract":"Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan may experience driving-related challenges postdeployment, including more at-fault crashes. Causes may include defensive driving tactics learned for combat zones and consequences of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Tailoring driver interventions to meet Veterans' needs requires an understanding of their driving perceptions. We explored the driving perceptions of five combat Veterans (4 men, 1 woman) with mild TBI and PTSD using grounded theory methods. Veterans participated in single, semistructured interviews during a comprehensive driving evaluation. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, verified, and imported into NVivo 8 software for coding and analysis. Veterans were insightful about driving and identified specific environmental triggers for anxious driving, speeding, and road rage. Veterans used strategies to moderate driving behaviors, but continued to drive aggressively. Themes were used to develop a conceptual framework of driving postdeployment, laying the foundation for intervention studies.
