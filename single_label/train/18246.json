{"id":18246,"title":"[Taxonomic composition of metagenomic community in the larval gut of mosquito Anopheles sinensis (Diptera: Culicidae)].","abstract":"To investigate the bacteria diversity in larval gut of field-collected Anopheles sinensis.The 16S rDNA V4 region of An. sinensis larvae collected from paddy on Jiading District of Shanghai (L1/L2) and small seeping water on Wenchang City of Hainan (AS) was sequenced by high-throughput pyrosequencing. Using Qiime and Mothur softwares, the number of sequences and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for each sample was sorted and calculated, the species abundance and distribution, Alpha diversity index and difference times of species abundance among samples were analyzed.The number of sequences and OTUs for each sample were 253 724/3 930 (L1), 225 203/4 312 (L2) and 73 990/2 380 (AS). The rarefaction curves showed that adequate sampling was achieved. The number of OTUs was close to actual situation. The value of richness index was 5 942.61/6 534.88 (L1), 6 328.17/7 235.89 (L2) and 4228.66/5 651.20 (AS); diversity index was 4.63/0.03 (L1), 5.10/0.02 (L2) and 0.14/3.94 (AS). The dominant species of An. sinensis larvae gut microbiota all belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria, with a percentage of 87% (AS) and 90% (L). In addition, the dominant phyla among them were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. The comparison of bacterial abundance between L and AS showed that there were 18 phyla with significant difference, except the Proteobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus; only 9 phyla were different significantly between L1 and L2.Evenness and richness of bacteria flora in the An. sinensis larvae gut collected from paddy and small seeping waters were obtained.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809191","annotations":[{"name":"Firmicutes","weight":0.950911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmicutes"},{"name":"Proteobacteria","weight":0.902861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteobacteria"},{"name":"Actinobacteria","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinobacteria"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Fly","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly"},{"name":"Phylum","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Mosquito","weight":0.769027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Bacteroidetes","weight":0.756175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteroidetes"},{"name":"Metagenomics","weight":0.719924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics"},{"name":"16S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.718362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Taxon","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon"},{"name":"Ribosomal DNA","weight":0.47712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_DNA"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.461767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anopheles","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.238585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Rice","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Flora","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora"},{"name":"Shanghai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai"},{"name":"Hainan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan"},{"name":"Pyrosequencing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrosequencing"},{"name":"Alpha diversity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_diversity"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Apex predator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_predator"},{"name":"Abundance (ecology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_(ecology)"},{"name":"Community (ecology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(ecology)"},{"name":"Cold seep","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_seep"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
