{"id":50257,"title":"Multisystem manifestations of benign ovarian teratomas.","abstract":"A 26-year-old woman presented with acute onset of right-sided pelvic pain and had a medical history significant for migraine headaches and polycystic ovarian disease. Ultrasonography demonstrated bilateral ovarian tumors, and the patient underwent laparoscopic removal of bilateral cystic teratomas. A literature review focused on similar presentations of teratomas revealed isolated cases of migraines and polycystic ovarian disease associated with teratomas and an increased risk for ovarian torsion. Our patient experienced complete resolution of her acute abdominal pain, as well as her long-standing headaches and hormonal symptoms, after removal of the teratomas.
