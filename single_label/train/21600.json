{"id":21600,"title":"Effect of arginase inhibition on pulmonary L-arginine metabolism in murine Pseudomonas pneumonia.","abstract":"Infection of the lung with Pseudomonas aeruginosa results in upregulation of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and arginase expression, and both enzymes compete for L-arginine as substrate. Nitric oxide (NO) production may be regulated by arginase as it controls L-arginine availability for NOS. We here studied the effect of systemic arginase inhibition on pulmonary L-arginine metabolism in Pseudomonas pneumonia in the mouse.Mice (C57BL/6, 8-10 weeks old, female) underwent direct tracheal instillation of Pseudomonas (PAO-1)-coated agar beads and were treated by repeated intra-peritoneal injections of the arginase inhibitor 2(S)-amino-6-boronohexanoic acid (ABH) or PBS until lungs were harvested on day 3 of the infection. L-arginine metabolites were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, NO metabolites nitrate and nitrite by Griess reagent and cytokines by ELISA.NO metabolite concentrations (48.5±2.9 vs. 10.9±2.3 µM, p<0.0001), as well as L-ornithine (29.6±1.7 vs 2.3±0.4 µM, p<0.0001), the product of arginase activity, were increased in Pseudomonas infected lungs compared to naïve controls. Concentrations of the NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) were also increased (0.44±0.02 vs. 0.16±0.01 µM, p<0.0001). Arginase inhibition in the infected animals resulted in a significant decrease in L-ornithine (14.6±1.6 µM, p<0.0001) but increase in L-arginine concentration (p<0.001), L-arginine/ADMA ratio (p<0.001), L-arginine availability for NOS (p<0.001), and NO metabolite concentrations (67.3±5.7 µM, p<0.05). Arginase inhibitor treatment also resulted in an increase in NO metabolite levels in animals following intratracheal injection of LPS (p?=?0.015). Arginase inhibition was not associated with an increase in inflammatory markers (IFN-?, IL-1?, IL-6, MIP-2, KC or TNF-?) in lung. Concentrations of the L-ornithine-dependent polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine were increased in Pseudomonas infected lungs (p<0.001, respectively) but were unaffected by ABH treatment.Systemic arginase inhibition with ABH during Pseudomonas pneumonia in mice results in an increase in pulmonary NO formation but no pro-inflammatory effect.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595185","annotations":[{"name":"Pseudomonas
