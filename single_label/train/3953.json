{"id":3953,"title":"A probabilistic approach to quantification of melanin and hemoglobin content in dermoscopy images.","abstract":"We describe a technique that employs the stochastic Latent Topic Models framework to allow quantification of melanin and hemoglobin content in dermoscopy images. Such information bears useful implications for analysis of skin hyperpigmentation, and for classification of skin diseases. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches while allowing for more stringent and probabilistic modeling than previously.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25333100","annotations":[{"name":"Probability","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Stochastic","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.234482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.188159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.133226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Melanin","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin"},{"name":"Hyperpigmentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpigmentation"},{"name":"Dermatoscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatoscopy"},{"name":"Bear","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Topic Records","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_Records"},{"name":"Probabilistic risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_risk_assessment"},{"name":"Latency stage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_stage"},{"name":"Conceptual framework","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework"}]}
