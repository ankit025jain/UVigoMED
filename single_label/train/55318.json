{"id":55318,"title":"Association of LOXL1 polymorphisms with pseudoexfoliation, glaucoma, intraocular pressure, and systemic diseases in a Greek population. The Thessaloniki eye study.","abstract":"To investigate the association of the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lysyl oxidase-like 1 (LOXL1) gene with pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX), pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PEXG), and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in a Greek population-based setting, from the Thessaloniki Eye study.A total of 233 subjects with successful DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and genotyping were included in the genetic analysis of G153D and R141L SNPs of LOXL1 gene and classified into four groups: controls (n = 93); subjects with PEX (n = 40); POAG (n = 66); and PEXG (n = 34). Multinomial logistic regression was used to test their association with LOXL1 SNPs with adjustment for covariates. The association of LOXL1 with IOP (in untreated subjects) and with systemic diseases was explored.Both LOXL1 SNPs were present in high frequencies in controls and cases. The G153D was strongly associated with both PEX (odds ratio [OR] = 23.2, P = 0.003 for allele G) and PEXG (OR = 24.75, P = 0.003 for allele G) and was not associated with POAG (P = 0.451). In contrast, the R141L was not associated with PEX (P = 0.81), PEXG (P = 0.063), or POAG (P = 0.113). No association of the G153D with either intraocular pressure (IOP) or systemic diseases was found.In the Thessaloniki Eye Study, the G153D SNP of LOXL1 gene was strongly associated with both PEX and PEXG, whereas the R141L was not associated. No association of the LOXL1 with IOP or with systemic diseases was found. These findings further support the hypothesis that the LOXL1 gene contributes to onset of PEXG through PEX. Gene variants of LOXL1 do not help to identify those with PEX at increased risk for glaucoma development.","date":"2014-07-12","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917141","annotations":[{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.827199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.783382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.761983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.558349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.519239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Greek language","weight":0.483552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.418969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.362149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.277325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.136379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Genetic analysis","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_analysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Thessaloniki","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki"},{"name":"LOXL1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOXL1"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Eye","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
