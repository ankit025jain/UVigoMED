{"id":77723,"title":"Tuberculosis risk in health care workers.","abstract":"Risk to health care workers (HCW) is of paramount importance in the global fight against tuberculosis (TB). There is mounting evidence that they are at increased risk of contracting TB infection as well as developing the disease. This occupational risk is at alarming proportions in the low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), because of increased exposure and lack of preventive measures. Although tuberculin skin test has been used for a long time to detect latent TB infection (LTBI), it has significant drawbacks. Interferon-gamma release assays arrived with a lot of promise, but the expected benefit of more specific diagnosis has not yet been proved. The treatment of LTBI is an area, which is not well studied in LMIC. Effective environmental and personal protective measures along with education to the patients and the HCW needs to be carried out expeditiously, to reduce the occupational risk of TB.","date":"2014-01-01","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24380222","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.840486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.668297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.636623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.519367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.328658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.210938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Tuberculin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin"},{"name":"Expected value","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"},{"name":"Latent tuberculosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"}]}
