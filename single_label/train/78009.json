{"id":78009,"title":"Newborn dried blood-spot screening of the p.V37I variant of GJB2 by high-resolution melting analysis.","abstract":"To establish a high-throughput, low-cost method for neonatal genetic testing of the p.V37I of GJB2 gene, which is highly prevalent in East Asians and strongly associated with postnatal childhood hearing impairment.A total of 6460 newborn blood-spot DNA samples were screened by high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA).The screening results were further verified by direct sequencing of 28 homozygous, 545 heterozygous and 200 wild-type samples.Our study indicated that the HRMA-based bloodspot screening method was of very high sensitivity and specificity and was suitable for large-scale screening of the p.V37I variants in newborns.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814571","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.814488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.762575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.591839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.582528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.353709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.266542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"DNA profiling","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling"},{"name":"GJB2","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GJB2"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Nucleic acid thermodynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_thermodynamics"},{"name":"Breast cancer screening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_screening"}]}
