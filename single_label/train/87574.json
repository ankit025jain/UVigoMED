{"id":87574,"title":"Head injuries following television-related accidents in the pediatric population.","abstract":"Current data indicate the rate of head injuries in children caused by falling televisions is increasing. The authors describe these injuries and the cost incurred by them.In a single-institution retrospective review, all children treated for a television-related injury at LeBonheur Children's Hospital, a Level I pediatric trauma center, between 2009 and 2013 were identified through the institution's trauma registry. The type, mechanism, and severity of cranial injuries, surgical interventions, outcome, and costs were examined.Twenty-six patients were treated for a television-related injury during the study period. Most injuries (22 cases, 85%) occurred in children aged 2-4 years (mean age 3.3 years), and 19 (73%) of the 26 patients were male. Head injuries occurred in 20 patients (77%); these injuries ranged from concussion to skull fractures and subdural, subarachnoid, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages. The average Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission was 12 (range 7-15), and 3 patients (12%) had neurological deficits. Surgical intervention was required in 5 cases (19%). The majority of patients made a full recovery. There were no deaths. The total cost for television-related injuries was $1.4 million, with an average cost of $53,893 per accident.A high occurrence of head injuries was seen following television-related accidents in young children. This injury is ideal for a public education campaign targeting parents, health care workers, and television manufacturers.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25084085","annotations":[{"name":"Glasgow Coma Scale","weight":0.820516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.692303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.65048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.541196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.521073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.496718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.466203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.402661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.363127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.175317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Skull fracture","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_fracture"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Subarachnoid space","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_space"},{"name":"Subdural hematoma","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdural_hematoma"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Intraparenchymal hemorrhage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraparenchymal_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Idealism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Functional neurological deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neurological_deficit"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
