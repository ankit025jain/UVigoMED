{"id":69513,"title":"Kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1 is associated with insulin resistance: results from two community-based studies of elderly individuals.","abstract":"Insulin resistance has been shown to be closely associated with glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, even prior to the development of diabetes. Urinary kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) is a novel, highly specific marker of kidney tubular damage. The role of insulin resistance in the development of kidney tubular damage is not previously reported. Thus, we aimed to investigate the associations between insulin sensitivity (assessed by HOMA) and urinary KIM-1.Two community-based cohorts of elderly individuals were investigated: Prospective Investigation of the vasculature in Uppsala seniors (PIVUS, n=701; mean age 75 years, 52% women); and Uppsala Longitudinal Study of adult men (ULSAM, n=533; mean age 78 years).Lower insulin sensitivity was associated with higher urinary KIM-1 in both cohorts after adjustments for age, BMI, blood pressure, antihypertensive treatment, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (PIVUS: regression coefficient for 1-SD higher HOMA-IR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03-0.20, p=0.009, and ULSAM: 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.22, p=0.007). Results were similar in individuals without diabetes, with normal kidney function and normo-albuminuria.Our findings in elderly individuals support the notion that the interplay between an impaired glucose metabolism and renal tubular damage is evident even prior to the development of diabetes and overt kidney disease.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438875","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.910318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.644974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.585901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.576646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.566181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.562161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.366942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Peptide sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_sequence"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Homeostatic model assessment","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostatic_model_assessment"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
