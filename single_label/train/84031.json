{"id":84031,"title":"[Same day postoperative examination after cataract surgery under local anesthesia--huge economic impact without increased risk].","abstract":"Cataract surgery is one of the most common surgeries in medicine. Re-evaluating the regimen for followup might save thousands of visits to the clinic and many working days every year.To check the safety of same day postoperative follow-up as a substitute for the common practice in Israel of examination on the next day.Retrospective examination of the digital files of patients after cataract surgery, who had their first postoperative examination on the same day of the surgery and the second examination after 1 week, during 2 years in a private clinic.Six hundred and sixty two files of patients were included in the study. Twenty nine had intraocular pressure (IOP) above 22 mmHg during the same day examination; 2 of those also had high pressure after 1 week. Two patients with residual lens material were re-operated one week later. Two had small corneal erosion, and one had anterior synechia; all were immediately treated in the clinic. Four patients were admitted, 3 for endophthalmitis, with no bacterial growth, and one for TASS [Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome). Two patients had vitrectomy, and 2 had conservative treatment; all ended up with good visual acuity. All 4 patients were examined after calling the surgeon complaining of visual acuity deterioration, and arrived at the hospital early with no delay in the diagnosis.A change in the follow-up regimen after cataract surgery did not increase the risk for complications. It is safe and economical and should be considered nationally.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
