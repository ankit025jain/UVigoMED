{"id":44322,"title":"Anorectal conditions: hemorrhoids.","abstract":"Hemorrhoids are engorged fibrovascular cushions lining the anal canal. Constipation, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and prolonged straining predispose to hemorrhoids. Approximately 1 in 20 Americans and almost one-half of individuals older than 50 years experience symptomatic hemorrhoids. Bright red, painless rectal bleeding during defecation is the most common presentation. Even if hemorrhoids are seen on examination, patients with rectal bleeding who are at risk of colorectal cancer (eg, adults older than 50 years) should still undergo colonoscopy to exclude cancer as the etiology. Nonsurgical treatment for nonthrombosed hemorrhoids includes increased fiber intake, sitz baths, and drugs. If nonsurgical management is unsuccessful, rubber band ligation is the most effective office-based procedure for grades I, II, and III hemorrhoids. Surgical hemorrhoidectomy is indicated after failure of nonsurgical management and office-based procedures and also as initial management for grades III and IV hemorrhoids. Several different procedures can be used. For acutely thrombosed external hemorrhoids, excision and evacuation of the clot, ideally within 72 hours of symptom onset, is the optimal management. Prolapsed and strangulated hemorrhoids are best managed with stool softeners, analgesics, rest, warm soaks, and ice packs until recovery; residual hemorrhoids are banded or excised later.
