{"id":50174,"title":"Corneal biomechanical properties measured by the ocular response analyzer in acromegalic patients.","abstract":"To investigate the effect of acromegaly on corneal biomechanical parameters.This cross-sectional, comparative clinical study included 34 acromegalic patients and 30 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls. Corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), Goldmann-correlated and corneal-compensated intraocular pressure (IOPg and IOPcc, respectively) were measured using the Ocular Response Analyzer. Central corneal thickness (CCT) was determined with the ultrasonic pachymeter.The mean duration of disease for the acromegalic patients was 5.3 years. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding mean CH, CRF, IOPg and IOPcc values. The respective mean values in patients with acromegaly and controls were 10.3?±?2.2 and 9.5?±?1.5 mmHg (p?=?0.13) for CH; 10.5?±?2.4 and 9.7?±?1.7 mmHg (p?=?0.16) for CRF, 16.1?±?3.6 and 15.5?±?2.9 mmHg (p?=?0.49) for IOPg, 16.8?±?3.4 and 17.0?±?2.8 mmHg (p?=?0.82) for IOPcc, and 544.8?±?32.2 and 530.7?±?22.9 ?m (p?=?0.05) for CCT. A significant moderate correlation was detected between the duration of acromegaly and IOPg OD (r?=?0.430, p?=?0.01). There was no significant correlation between other ocular parameters and levels of GH and IGF-1 at the time of diagnosis, the status of control, adenoma type, radiotherapy treatment, and drug usage.In acromegalic patients, the duration of disease was correlated with IOPg OD level. Corneal biomechanical parameters and CCT values were not significantly different than those in age-matched and sex-matched healthy individuals.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819322","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.67991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.562024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Acromegaly","weight":0.49665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromegaly"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.445037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.263432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.211658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor 1","weight":0.210579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.11135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Hysteresis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis"},{"name":"Pachymeter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachymeter"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Optometry","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Corticotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Insulin-like growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor"},{"name":"832","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/832"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Order of the Companions of Honour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Companions_of_Honour"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Analyser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyser"},{"name":"Analyzer (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyzer_(comics)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Area code 530","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_530"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"}]}
