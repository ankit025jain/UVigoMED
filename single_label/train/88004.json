{"id":88004,"title":"[Children with minor head injury in the emergency department: Is skull radiography necessary for children under 2 years?].","abstract":"Current guidelines on the management of mild head trauma (traumatic brain injury/TBI) do not include the presence of a skull fracture in determining the risk of intracranial injury. However, in our setting cranial radiography is still performed frequently to rule out the presence of skull fracture.To estimate the prevalence of clinically-important traumatic brain injuries (ciTBI) in children younger than two years of age with mild TBI.Descriptive observational study. All children attended in emergency department with mild TBI (Glasgow ?14 points) for a year were included. We defined ciTBI as intracranial injuries that caused death or required neurosurgery, intubation for more than 24 hours, inotropic drugs or mechanical ventilation.The study included 854 children, of which 457 (53.5%) were male. The median patient age was 11.0 months (P25-75: 7.5-17.0 months). In 741 cases (86.8%) the mechanism of TBI was a fall. In 438 cases (51.3%) skull radiography was performed. Eleven children (1.3%) had intracranial injury, but none met the criteria for ciTBI (estimated prevalence of ciTBI was 0%; CI 95%: 0%-0.4%).Children younger than two years of age with mild TBI have low prevalence of ciTBI. Consequently, it is possible to monitor children younger than two years with a TBI without performing skull radiography.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930859","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Skull fracture","weight":0.785439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_fracture"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.648721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.468607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.449028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.370839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.351701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"Inotrope","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotrope"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"}]}
