{"id":63123,"title":"Survival of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Germany and the United States.","abstract":"Adulthood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a rare disease. In contrast to childhood ALL, survival for adults with ALL is poor. Recently, new protocols, including use of pediatric protocols in young adults, have improved survival in clinical trials. Here, we examine population level survival in Germany and the United States (US) to gain insight into the extent to which changes in clinical trials have translated into better survival on the population level.Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database in the US and 11 cancer registries in Germany. Patients age 15-69 diagnosed with ALL were included. Period analysis was used to estimate 5-year relative survival (RS).Overall 5-year RS was estimated at 43.4% for Germany and 35.5% for the US (p?=?0.004), with a decrease in survival with increasing age. Survival was higher in Germany than the US for men (43.6% versus 37.7%, p?=?0.002) but not for women (42.4% versus 40.3%, p>0.1). Five-year RS estimates increased in Germany and the US between 2002 and 2006 by 11.8 and 7.3 percent units, respectively (p?=?0.02 and 0.04, respectively).Survival for adults with ALL continues to be low compared with that for children, but a substantial increase in 5-year survival estimates was seen from 2002 to 2006 in both Germany and the US. The reasons for the survival differences between both countries require clarification.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475044","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.742567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.668446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.419937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.393264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.388382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.301923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.287608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.137017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0392089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Relative survival","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_survival"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"1569","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1569"},{"name":"Rio Grande do Sul","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Breed registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed_registry"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Clarification and stabilization of wine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarification_and_stabilization_of_wine"},{"name":"Population projection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_projection"},{"name":"Period (geology)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(geology)"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
