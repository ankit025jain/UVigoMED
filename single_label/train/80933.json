{"id":80933,"title":"Communicating the AMFm message: exploring the effect of communication and training interventions on private for-profit provider awareness and knowledge related to a multi-country anti-malarial subsidy intervention.","abstract":"The Affordable Medicines Facility - malaria (AMFm), implemented at national scale in eight African countries or territories, subsidized quality-assured artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) and included communication campaigns to support implementation and promote appropriate anti-malarial use. This paper reports private for-profit provider awareness of key features of the AMFm programme, and changes in provider knowledge of appropriate malaria treatment.This study had a non-experimental design based on nationally representative surveys of outlets stocking anti-malarials before (2009/10) and after (2011) the AMFm roll-out.Based on data from over 19,500 outlets, results show that in four of eight settings, where communication campaigns were implemented for 5-9Â months, 76%-94% awareness of the AMFm 'green leaf' logo, 57%-74% awareness of the ACT subsidy programme, and 52%-80% awareness of the correct recommended retail price (RRP) of subsidized ACT were recorded. However, in the remaining four settings where communication campaigns were implemented for three months or less, levels were substantially lower. In six of eight settings, increases of at least 10 percentage points in private for-profit providers' knowledge of the correct first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria were seen; and in three of these the levels of knowledge achieved at endline were over 80%.The results support the interpretation that, in addition to the availability of subsidized ACT, the intensity of communication campaigns may have contributed to the reported levels of AMFm-related awareness and knowledge among private for-profit providers. Future subsidy programmes for anti-malarials or other treatments should similarly include communication activities.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495691","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.678432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.544062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.384237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Subsidy","weight":0.305179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.222222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Retail","weight":0.210822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.145929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Logo","weight":0.115637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo"},{"name":"Price","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Artemisinin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisinin"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Aquaculture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Rollout (poker)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollout_(poker)"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Provinces and territories of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"5280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5280"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"ACT (test)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_(test)"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"List of countries where English is an official language","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_where_English_is_an_official_language"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Suggested retail price","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggested_retail_price"}]}
