{"id":65931,"title":"Mortality of urinary tract cancer in Inner Mongolia 2008- 2012.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the mortality rate and burden of urinary tract cancers among residents of Inner Mongolia. We analyzed mortality data reported by the Death Registry System from 2008 to 2012. The rate of mortality due to urinary tract cancer was 2.04 per 100,000 person-years for the total population, 2.91 for men, and 1.11 for women. Therefore, the mortality rate for men was 2.62-fold the mortality rate for women, constituting a statistically significant difference (p<0.001). Over the period 2008 through 2012, the total potential years of life lost was 1388.1 person-years for men and 777.1 person-years for women, and the average years of life lost were 7.71 years per male decedent and 12.0 years per female decedent. Mortality due to urinary tract cancers is substantially greater among the elderly population. Further, the mortality rate associated with urinary tract cancers is greater for elderly men than it is for elderly women. Therefore, in Inner Mongolia, urinary tract cancers appear to pose a greater mortality risk for men than they do for women.
