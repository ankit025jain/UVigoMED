{"id":2987,"title":"[Identification of preterm labor: the role of fetal fibronectin in parents with symptoms].","abstract":"To determine whether the presence of fetal fibronectin in vaginal secretions of patients with symptoms suggestive of preterm labor predicts preterm delivery. Fetal fibronectin, a large molecular weight glycoprotein produced in the chorion, is expressed in cervical and vaginal secretions in women with disruption of the choriodecidual junction by labor or by inflammation.A prospective observational longitudinal study from January 2013 till December 2013 was performed on patients between 24 and 32 weeks of gestation with symptoms of preterm labor, intact membranes, and cervical dilation < 4 cm (total patients = 86). The endpoint was the delivery at 34 weeks or more. The screening methods used were: the fFN test and the cervical length measurement by transvaginal according to an established protocol.The presence of FFN in vaginal or cervical secretions before 35 weeks is a is a strong predictor that preterm delivery is unlikely within the next 7 to 14 days. The predictive power of FFN is stronger at earlier gestation ages (24-29 wks) than it is later in pregnancy and is stronger for short-term prediction (7-14 d).","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25510036","annotations":[{"name":"Chorion","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorion"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.837012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.814156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.772903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Fetal fibronectin","weight":0.721369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_fibronectin"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.617155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Cervical dilation","weight":0.562222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_dilation"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.475208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.420466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Molecular weight","weight":0.267195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_weight"},{"name":"Vaginal lubrication","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_lubrication"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Fibronectin","weight":0.222222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibronectin"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.221984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.201829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Predictive power","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_power"}]}
