{"id":12680,"title":"Possible hepatoprotective effects of lacidipine in irradiated DOCA-salt hypertensive albino rats.","abstract":"Calcium channel blockers are increasingly used for the treatment of hypertension. Hypertension is an important risk factor for liver damage and several other circulatory abnormalities. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of lacidipine in a irradiation-induced hepatocellular damage model in Deoxyc Orticosterone Acetate (DOCA)-salt-induced hypertensive model in rats. In this study, animals were divided into five groups as follows: control (Group 1), hypertensive (Group 2), irradiated (Group 3), irradiated and hypertensive (Group 4) and irradiated, hypertensive and lacidipine-treated (Group 5). At the end of the experiment, the livers were removed and its homogenates were biochemically examined. Significant differences were found between values of all groups (p < 0.05). Group 3 and particularly Group 4 showed significant increase in lipid peroxidation and Nitric Oxide (NO) and serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) with a significant reduction in serum level of alanine amine transferase (ALT) enzyme and in superoxide dismutase in red blood cells lysates. Lacidipine-treated group (5) showed a significant reduction in elevated systolic blood pressure together with a great protection of ALT and SOD enzymes from the destructive effects of irradiation and hypertension. Additionally, this CCB reduces hepatic NO and serum TNF-alpha levels that were increased in groups (2,3,4). The present study suggests that lacidipine has some important protective effects on liver of hypertensive irradiated albino rats.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511746","annotations":[{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Transferase","weight":0.751278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferase"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.709712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.583202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.576586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.563779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.534824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Calcium channel","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.452692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.390881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.161358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.153971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hepatoprotection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatoprotection"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"}]}
