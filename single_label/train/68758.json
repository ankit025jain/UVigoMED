{"id":68758,"title":"Immuno-virological discordance and the risk of non-AIDS and AIDS events in a large observational cohort of HIV-patients in Europe.","abstract":"The impact of immunosuppression despite virological suppression (immuno-virological discordance, ID) on the risk of developing fatal and non-fatal AIDS/non-AIDS events is unclear and remains to be elucidated.Patients in EuroSIDA starting at least 1 new antiretroviral drug with CD4<350 cells/Âµl and viral load (VL)>500 copies/mL were followed-up from the first day of VL<?=?50 copies/ml until a new fatal/non-fatal non-AIDS/AIDS event. Considered non-AIDS events included non-AIDS malignancies, pancreatitis, severe liver disease with hepatic encephalopathy (>grade 3), cardio- and cerebrovascular events, and end-stage renal disease. Patients were classified over time according to whether current CD4 count was above (non-ID) or below (ID) baseline level. Relative rates (RR) of events were calculated for ID vs. non-ID using adjusted Poisson regression models.2,913 patients contributed 11,491 person-years for the analysis of non-AIDS. 241 pre-specified non-AIDS events (including 84 deaths) and 89 AIDS events (including 10 deaths) occurred. The RR of developing pre-specified non-AIDS events for ID vs. non-ID was 1.96 (95% CI 1.37-2.81, p<0.001) in unadjusted analysis and 1.43 (0.94-2.17, p?=?0.095) after controlling for current CD4 count. ID was not associated with the risk of AIDS events (aRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.41-1.38, p?=?0.361).Compared to CD4 responders, patients with immuno-virological discordance may be at increased risk of developing non-AIDS events. Further studies are warranted to establish whether in patients with ID, strategies to directly modify CD4 count response may be needed besides the use of ART.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498036","annotations":[{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Hepatic encephalopathy","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.761137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.746163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.412888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.402615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.382257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.333004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.320833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Idaho","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"913","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/913"},{"name":"241","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/241"},{"name":"372","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/372"},{"name":"361","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/361"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"942","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/942"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
