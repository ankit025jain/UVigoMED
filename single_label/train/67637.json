{"id":67637,"title":"Effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet in stroke patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis.","abstract":"Antiplatelet therapy is known to decrease the risk of secondary ischemic stroke. However, the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease are uncertain, especially in dialysis.We estimated the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet drugs (aspirin and clopidogrel) for the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis during long-term follow-up after first-time ischemic stroke.The cases were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Antiplatelet therapy was administered for 11 years to patients experiencing a first ischemic stroke between 1998 and 2006. Primary outcomes, including death and readmission to hospital for stroke, and secondary outcomes, including death, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction or bleeding, were examined.In total, 1936 patients experienced a first ischemic stroke during the follow-up. In a time-dependent analysis, the hazard ratio for primary outcomes in patients treated with aspirin was 0·671 (P?<?0·001) and that for clopidogrel was 0·933 (P?=?0·497). At secondary outcomes, patients treated with aspirin, hazard ratio for readmission for stroke was 0·715 (P?=?0·002) and that for bleeding was 0·885 (P?=?0·291). Independent risk factors for mortality and readmission due to ischemic stroke included age, diabetes mellitus, and administration of proton pump inhibitors.Antiplatelet therapy, especially aspirin, still offers safe and effective treatment for ischemic stroke prevention in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital
