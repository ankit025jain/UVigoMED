{"id":26927,"title":"Primary aortic thrombosis: role of enhanced multislice CT demonstrated in three exceptional cases.","abstract":"Primary aortic thrombosis remains a rare entity that can be defined as clotting of the vessel without any obvious atheromatous lesion. Cancer chemotherapy, cocaine intake, essential thrombocythemia, some hypercoagulable states, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, inflammatory disease of the digestive tract and acute pancreatitis are, beside some cases of rather unknown etiology, the causes of primary aortic thrombosis. Intravenous contrast-enhanced multislice CT, which is widely available, noninvasive and affordable in terms of cost, is the imaging modality of choice for the investigation of primary aortic thrombosis and the assessment of potential complications. Three cases due to chemotherapy, antiphospholipid syndrome and acute pancreatitis are reported.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073235","annotations":[{"name":"Antiphospholipid syndrome","weight":0.847128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiphospholipid_syndrome"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.797488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.79742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.785708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Essential thrombocytosis","weight":0.761552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_thrombocytosis"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Thrombocytosis","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.707851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.671356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Acute pancreatitis","weight":0.581063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.555169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.532105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Thrombophilia","weight":0.197423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombophilia"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"History of cancer chemotherapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cancer_chemotherapy"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}]}
