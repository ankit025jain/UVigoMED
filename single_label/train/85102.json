{"id":85102,"title":"Factors affecting major morbidity after video-assisted thoracic surgery for lung cancer.","abstract":"Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has been widely applied in the treatment of lung cancer. However, few studies have focused on the clinical factors predicting the major postoperative complications.Clinical data from 525 patients who underwent resection of primary lung cancer with VATS from January 2007-August 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Risk factors related to major postoperative complications were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses with logistic regression.Major complications occurred in 36 (6.86%) patients, of which seven died (1.33%) within 30 d, postoperatively. Major complications included respiratory failure, hemothorax, myocardial infarction, heart failure, bronchial fistula, cerebral infarction, and pulmonary embolism. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that age >70 y (odds ratio [OR], 2.105; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.205-3.865), forced expiratory volume during the first second expressed as a percentage of predicted ?70% (OR, 2.106; 95% CI 1.147-3.982) combined with coronary heart disease (OR, 2.257; 95% CI 1.209-4.123) were independent prognostic factors for major complications.Age >70 and forced expiratory volume during the first second expressed as a percentage of predicted ?70% combined with coronary heart disease are independent prognostic factors for postoperative major complications. Patients in these groups should undergo careful preoperative evaluation and perioperative management.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Respiratory Tract
