{"id":73767,"title":"Violapyrones H and I, new cytotoxic compounds isolated from Streptomyces sp. associated with the marine starfish Acanthaster planci.","abstract":"Two new ?-pyrone derivatives, violapyrones H (1) and I (2), along with known violapyrones B (3) and C (4) were isolated from the fermentation broth of a marine actinomycete Streptomyces sp. The strain was derived from a crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci, collected from Chuuk, Federated States of Micronesia. The structures of violapyrones were elucidated by the analysis of 1D and 2D NMR and HR-ESIMS data. Violapyrones (1-4) exhibited cytotoxicity against 10 human cancer cell lines with GI50 values of 1.10-26.12 ?g/mL when tested using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. This is the first report on the cytotoxicity of violapyrones against cancer cell lines and the absolute configuration of violapyrone C.
