{"id":62819,"title":"Challenges and potential solutions for recruitment and retention of hematopoietic cell transplantation physicians: the National Marrow Donor Program's System Capacity Initiative Physician Workforce Group report.","abstract":"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains the only known curative therapy for many patients with hematologic, metabolic, and immunologic disorders. Furthermore, the use of HCT has increased with the emergence of HCT as a viable therapeutic option for older patients, those with significant comorbidities, and, with the demonstrated clinical effectiveness of alternative allogeneic donor sources, for those patients without a suitable sibling donor. The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) estimates that by 2020, it will facilitate 10,000 transplantations per year, double the number in 2010. To understand the needs of the HCT infrastructure to facilitate this number of transplantations, the NMDP organized the System Capacity Initiative 2020, centered on 6 working groups representing a diverse group of stakeholders. The Physician Workforce Group was tasked with addressing issues relating to recruitment and retention of transplantation physicians. We report here the results of our efforts and future initiatives.
