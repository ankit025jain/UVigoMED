{"id":72846,"title":"Population pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate, in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: clinical implications of the effect of covariates.","abstract":"Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab linked to DM1, a highly potent cytotoxic agent. A population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was performed to estimate typical values and interindividual variability of T-DM1 PK parameters and the effects of clinically relevant covariates.Serum samples were collected from 671 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who received single-agent T-DM1 in five phase I to phase III studies. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling with the first-order conditional estimation method was used.A linear two-compartment model with first-order elimination from the central compartment described T-DM1 PKs in the clinical dose range. T-DM1 elimination clearance was 0.676 L/day, volume of distribution in the central compartment (V c) was 3.127 L, and terminal elimination half-life was 3.94 days. Age, race, region, and renal function did not influence T-DM1 PK. Given the low-to-moderate effect of all statistically significant covariates on T-DM1 exposure, none of these covariates is expected to result in a clinically meaningful change in T-DM1 exposure.T-DM1 PK properties are consistent and predictable in patients. A further refinement of dose based on baseline covariates other than body weight for the current 3.6 mg/kg regimen would not yield clinically meaningful reductions in interindividual PK variability in patients with MBC.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24939213","annotations":[{"name":"Trastuzumab","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab"},{"name":"Epidermal
