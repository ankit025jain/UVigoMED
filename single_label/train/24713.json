{"id":24713,"title":"[Evaluation of the clinical, psychological and socio-environmental factors, affecting disability of elderly people undergoing surgical myocardial revascularization].","abstract":"Factors significant for clinical-and-labor prognosis in elderly patients with ischemic heart disease after surgical myocardial revascularization are considered in the article. The authors demonstrate that for each level of the problem there are their own significant factors. Besides, the most essential correlations between investigated factors are marked out. The results obtained will enable to determine more correctly clinical-and-labor prognosis for patients with ischemic heart disease and develop their efficient rehabilitation programs. It is demonstrated that elderly patients have some features of vital activity restriction which are necessary to take into account while medical social expertise and rehabilitation program development.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306675","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.653261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.622971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.585652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.329836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.173369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Vitalism","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.0496211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Computer programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"}]}
