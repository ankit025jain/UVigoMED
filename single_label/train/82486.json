{"id":82486,"title":"[Effect of a multifunctional instrument (HF scissors) in parotis surgery].","abstract":"Lateral parotidectomy is a demanding surgical procedure and requires a large number of instruments with a high frequency (HF) of alternating. Many functions, such as preparing, spreading, coagulating and cutting could be combined by using scissors with an integrated function of bipolar coagulation. This study has targeted an investigation of technical application, influence on surgery time, frequency of HF application and change of instruments.In the period between 01 April 2011 and 30 September 2012 (18 months) 35 procedures of lateral parotidectomy in 35 patients were investigated. In all cases lateral parotidectomy was carried out with a similar technique (modified extracapsular preparation). Workflow data were used from a control group in the period between 01 January 2009 and 31 December 2010 (24 months). The following parameters from both groups were documented and evaluated: incision-suture times (subdivided into nine sections of the procedure), change of instruments, period of application for HF function and early facial nerve function (6 h and 6 days after surgery according to House-Brackmann). Additionally, in the HF+ group a questionnaire that facilitated subjective evaluation of instruments was analyzed.It was possible to perform the surgery in both groups with neither technical nor surgical intraoperative complications. Incision-suture times showed an average reduction of 31.6 min (34.8 %) in the HF+ group. There was a reduction in the change of instruments compared to a conventional group (CONV) by up to 62.7 %. With the deployment of HF scissors there was a clear increase in the use of HF surgery by more than 100 % when comparing incision-suture times. Evaluation of both groups according to House-Brackmann showed a similar postoperative facial nerve function. The surgeons involved were of the opinion that in all 35 surgeries with HF scissors the intervention was easier and more comfortable.The use of HF scissors is appropriate for parotid gland surgery and can be used in all steps of the procedure. Incision-suture time can be reduced and the ergonomics of the intervention can be improved. Up to now no negative effects have been found in the quality of the results.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610088","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ergonomics","weight":0.357638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics"},{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.296487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.212232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.148859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"High frequency","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0547413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Parotis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"September 30","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_30"},{"name":"1 decametre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decametre"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Negative number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number"},{"name":"Multifunction printer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifunction_printer"},{"name":"Scissors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scissors"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Subdivision (land)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivision_(land)"},{"name":"Codec listening test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec_listening_test"},{"name":"Up (2009 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"},{"name":"Workflow","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow"}]}
