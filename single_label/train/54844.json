{"id":54844,"title":"A syndecan-4 binding peptide derived from laminin 5 uses a novel PKC? pathway to induce cross-linked actin network (CLAN) formation in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells.","abstract":"In this study, we examined the role(s) of syndecan-4 in regulating the formation of an actin geodesic dome structure called a cross-linked actin network (CLAN) in which syndecan-4 has previously been localized. CLANs have been described in several different cell types, but they have been most widely studied in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells where they may play a key role in controlling intraocular pressure by regulating aqueous humor outflow from the eye. In this study we show that a loss of cell surface synedcan-4 significantly reduces CLAN formation in HTM cells. Analysis of HTM cultures treated with or without dexamethasone shows that laminin 5 deposition within the extracellular matrix is increased by glucocorticoid treatment and that a laminin 5-derived, syndecan-4-binding peptide (PEP75), induces CLAN formation in TM cells. This PEP75-induced CLAN formation was inhibited by heparin and the broad spectrum PKC inhibitor Ro-31-7549. In contrast, the more specific PKC? inhibitor GÃ¶ 6976 had no effect, thus excluding PKC? as a downstream effector of syndecan-4 signaling. Analysis of PKC isozyme expression showed that HTM cells also expressed both PKC? and PKC?. Cells treated with a PKC? agonist formed CLANs while a PKC?/? agonist had no effect. These data suggest that syndecan-4 is essential for CLAN formation in HTM cells and that a novel PKC?-mediated signaling pathway can regulate formation of this unique actin structure.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25128150","annotations":[{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Isozyme","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isozyme"},{"name":"Aqueous humour","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_humour"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.765385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.748739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.710768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.680616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.667906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Laminin","weight":0.624741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminin"},{"name":"Protein kinase C","weight":0.567908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C"},{"name":"Trabecular meshwork","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabecular_meshwork"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.46357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.370331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.263256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.2089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.132057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Syndecan","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndecan"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancellous bone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
