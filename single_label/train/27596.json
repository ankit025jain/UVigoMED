{"id":27596,"title":"Patients' annual income adequacy, insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses related to heart failure care.","abstract":"To (1) identify the amount patients spend for insurance premiums, co-payments, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket costs related to HF and chronic health care services and estimate their annual non-reimbursed and out-of-pocket costs; and (2) identify patients' concerns about nonreimbursed and out-of-pocket expenses.HF is one of the most expensive illnesses for our society with multiple health services and financial burdens for families.Mixed methods with quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews.Patients (N = 149) reported annual averages for non-reimbursed health services co-payments and out-of-pocket costs ranging from $3913 to $5829 depending on insurance coverage. Thirty one patients (21%) reported inadequate health coverage related to their non-reimbursed costs.Non-reimbursed costs related to HF care are substantial and vary depending on their insurance, health services use, and out-of-pocket costs. Patient referral to social services to assist with expenses could provide some relief from the burden of high HF-related costs.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25012635","annotations":[{"name":"Social work","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.652002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.573334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.550287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.400359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.379776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.135569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Deductible","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"High frequency","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Multiracial","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial"}]}
