{"id":60887,"title":"A novel 6-mercaptopurine oral liquid formulation for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients - results of a randomized clinical trial.","abstract":"Pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are treated with oral 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) for nearly 2 years, but no pediatric formulation has been available. In this study, an oral 6MP liquid suitable for pediatric use was developed and tested in the target population.A randomized cross-over study was performed in 20 pediatric ALL patients (age 1.9 - 14.6 years), comparing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a newly developed 6MP liquid formulation to 6MP capsules, both taken orally for 4 weeks.Based upon trough levels of the principal active metabolite,6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN),a relative bioavailability of the liquid vs. capsules of 1.01 was found (90% CI 0.86 - 1.20), demonstrating bioequivalence. This was supported by the similarly observed 6MP dosages needed for leucocyte depletion, for both formulations (35 mg/day (range 10 - 115 mg)). 75% of the parents/patients (p = 0.005) preferred the oral liquid over the capsules because of the ease of administration.We conclude that the novel 6MP liquid is a promising treatment for ALL.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800919","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.859167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.807742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Bioavailability","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.786488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.749826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.671356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.660869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.634561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mercaptopurine","weight":0.425309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercaptopurine"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.37023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.305469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.247891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Tioguanine","weight":0.236682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tioguanine"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Bioequivalence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioequivalence"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Golgi apparatus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golgi_apparatus"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Member of Parliament","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Trough (meteorology)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)"}]}
