{"id":2985,"title":"[Plasma D-dimer levels in preeclampsia].","abstract":"Preeclampsia is a multifactorial disease characterized by hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation of the pregnancy. Preeclampsia is characterized by the deposition of fibrin in the walls of small blood vessels. D-dimer was used as a marker for degradation/synthesis of fibrin in vivo. D-dimer has emerged as a useful indicator in the diagnosis of thrombotic conditions because its plasma concentration has a high predictive value for the assessment of venous thromboembolism. The purpose of this study was to evaluate plasma levels of D-dimer and preeclampsia compared to normal pregnancy occurs. We found that elevated levels of D-dimer is associated with the development of preeclampsia in the third trimester of pregnancy compared with normal pregnancy occurs. Preliminary findings highlight the need for further in-depth studies during pregnancy in order to fully clarify the diagnostic/prognostic role of D-dimer preeclampsia.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25510047","annotations":[{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.69774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.660335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.63907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.594376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.0460588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Third trimester","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_trimester"}]}
