{"id":82408,"title":"Clinicobiological progression and prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma in relation to the tumor invasive front: impact on prognosis.","abstract":"There are several factors that influence the final outcome when treating oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Invasive front phenomena and more importantly their clinicopathological translation can have a direct impact on survival, and subsequently on the decision for an adjuvant treatment.In recent years, the concept of tumor-host interaction has been the subject of substantial efforts in cancer research. Tumoral behavior may be better understood when studying the changes occurring at the tumor-host interface. This study evaluated the influence of several clinicopathological features on the outcome of OSCCs.The clinical records and pathology specimens of 54 patients with OSCC treated by primary resection were reviewed retrospectively. The pathologic features reviewed were: invasive front grading (IFG), stromal reaction, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), margin status, and depth of invasion.High IFGs had a significant relationship with pT status and pN status. High IFGs were strongly correlated with nodal metastases (odds ratio (OR) = 4.77; confidence interaval (CI) = 1.37-16.64). Concerning survival, IFG had a strong impact on disease-free survival in patients treated unimodally, as did the depth of invasion in the same group. Lymphovascular involvement was found to have a negative impact on overall survival in patients treated multimodally.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628337","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.740761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.643481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.563645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.397191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.2432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Perineural invasion","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineural_invasion"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.114038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Cancer research","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Tesla (unit)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
