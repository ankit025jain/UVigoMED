{"id":43445,"title":"Novel natural mutations in the hepatitis B virus reverse transcriptase domain associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) mutations play a role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the association between HBV polymerase gene mutations and HCC has not been reported. In this study, we conducted a multi-stage study to identify HCC-related mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of the HBV polymerase gene.A total of 231 HCCs and 237 non-HCC controls from Qidong, China, were included in this study. The entire sequence of HBV RT was first compared between 29 HCC and 35 non-HCC cases, and candidate mutations were then evaluated in two independent validation sets.There were 15 candidate mutations identified from the discovery set, with A799G and T1055A being consistently associated with HCC across all studies. A pooled analysis of samples revealed that A799G, A987G, and T1055A were independent risk factors for HCC, with adjusted odds ratios of 5.53 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.69-18.10], 4.20 (95%CI, 1.15-15.35), and 3.78 (95%CI, 1.45-9.86), respectively. A longitudinal study showed that these mutations were detectable 4-5 years prior to HCC diagnosis.Our study provides evidence the first that HBV RT contains naturally occurring mutations that can be used as predictive markers for HCC.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System
