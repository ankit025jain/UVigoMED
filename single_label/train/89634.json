{"id":89634,"title":"How to prevent spinal cord injury during endovascular repair of thoracic aortic disease.","abstract":"The incidence of spinal cord injury in thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has been 3-5 % from recent major papers where sacrifice of the critical intercostal arteries is inevitable by a stent graft. Hemodynamic stability, which depends on a network of blood vessels around the cord is most important not only during but also after stent-graft deployment. High risk factors of spinal cord injury during endovascular aortic repair are (1) coverage of the left subclavian artery, (2) extensive coverage of long segments of the thoracic aorta, (3) prior downstream aortic repair, (4) compromising important intercostal (T8-L1), vertebral, pelvic and hypogastric collaterals, and (5) shaggy aorta. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative managements have been required to prevent spinal cord injury with TEVAR. For imaging assessment of blood supply to spinal cord including Adamkiewicz artery, prophylactic cerebrospinal fluid drainage is mandatory, and monitoring motor-evoked potential is recommended for high risk factors of spinal cord injury. Mean arterial pressure should be maintained over 90 mmHg after stent-graft placement for a while to prevent delayed spinal cord ischemia in high-risk patients of spinal cord ischemia. Finally, because spinal cord injury during TEVAR is not rare and negligible, perioperative care during TEVAR should be strictly performed according to the protocol proposed by each cardiovascular team.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696427","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Subclavian artery","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclavian_artery"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Mean arterial pressure","weight":0.808941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_arterial_pressure"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Thoracic aorta","weight":0.760214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_aorta"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Intercostal arteries","weight":0.712943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercostal_arteries"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.671311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.666356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.662339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Internal iliac artery","weight":0.613808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_iliac_artery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.513057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.45573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.449287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.42438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Endovascular aneurysm repair","weight":0.271502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_aneurysm_repair"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.206299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Intercostal muscle","weight":0.157211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercostal_muscle"},{"name":"Collateral circulation","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_circulation"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0592985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0387277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"}]}
