{"id":54436,"title":"Association between glycated hemoglobin and health utility for Type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"Cost-effectiveness models for diabetes link glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) to diabetes-related complications. Independent of diabetes-related complications, there is little known on the association between HbA1c and health utility scores. This link can alter the cost effectiveness of interventions designed to improve HbA1c. The cross-sectional relationship between HbA1c and health utility scores in adult type 1 diabetes patients was estimated after adjusting for diabetes-related complications.The EuroQoL-5 dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire and an ad hoc survey requesting demographic information and adherence to glucose monitoring therapies was administered to adult type 1 diabetes patients during a clinic visit and combined with clinical medical record data. Health utility scores were derived using the US time-tradeoff valuation of the EQ-5D. Linear regression was used to estimate the relationship between HbA1c and utility, adjusting for treatments, demographics, and diabetes-related complications.Among 176 patients, mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 38 (12.2) years, duration of disease was 22 (12.1) years, and number of chronic conditions other than type 1 diabetes was 2.7 (2.0). Unadjusted mean (SD) utility was 0.94 (0.09) for those with HbA1c levels <7 % (n = 54), 0.89 (0.15) for those with HbA1c ? 7 % (n = 122), and 0.91 (0.14) for all patients. After adjustment, a 1 % absolute increase in HbA1c was associated with a disutility of -0.03 (95 % confidence interval [CI] -0.049, -0.006).Findings suggest that, after adjusting for diabetes-related complications, higher HbA1c levels are associated with a significant health disutility. Pending additional data from longitudinal studies, these findings could be used in cost-effectiveness evaluations of type 1 diabetes interventions that impact HbA1c.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24458545","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.882556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.710287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.669129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.623759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.619937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.497222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.469426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.223677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.187122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.152918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.104122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Cost-effectiveness analysis","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-effectiveness_analysis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Blood glucose monitoring","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_glucose_monitoring"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Linear model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_model"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Ad hoc","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
