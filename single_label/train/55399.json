{"id":55399,"title":"Femtosecond laser-assisted astigmatic keratotomy for postoperative trabeculectomy-induced corneal astigmatism.","abstract":"To describe a case of postoperative trabeculectomy-induced corneal astigmatism treated with femtosecond laser-assisted astigmatic keratotomy.After trabeculectomy, the patient demonstrated change in manifest refraction from -0.5 diopters preoperatively to mixed astigmatism of -3.5 + 5.25@100 postoperatively and a decrease in uncorrected distance visual acuity from 20/60 preoperatively to 20/200 at 1 month postoperatively. Because the patient was intolerant to spectacle use, she underwent femtosecond laser-assisted astigmatic keratotomy.After astigmatic keratotomy there was improvement in corneal topographic astigmatism from 4.15 to 0.81 diopters with uncorrected distance visual acuity of 20/60(-2) and manifest refraction of -0.75 + 1.0@90 at 3 months postoperatively. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications.Femtosecond laser-assisted astigmatic keratotomy may be considered in eyes with postoperative trabeculectomy-induced mixed astigmatism.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24892377","annotations":[{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.827484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.781812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Radial keratotomy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_keratotomy"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.673055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Glasses","weight":0.65855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.374829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.358193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Trabeculectomy","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabeculectomy"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"2060s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2060s"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Toleration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toleration"}]}
