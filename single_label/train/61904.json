{"id":61904,"title":"Treatment of hemolymphangioma of the spleen by laparoscopic partial splenectomy: a case report.","abstract":"Hemolymphangioma is a malformation of both lymphatic and blood vessels. The incidence of splenic hemolymphangioma is extremely rare. Laparoscopic partial splenectomy is feasible, reproducible, and safe in children with focal splenic tumors. We report on the case of a 12-year-old male with a large splenic hemolymphangioma successfully managed by laparoscopic partial splenectomy. The patient recovered well after operation. Laparoscopic partial splenectomy is a safe and minimally invasive technique for treatment of splenic hemolymphangioma located in the pole of the spleen.
