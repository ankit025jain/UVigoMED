{"id":69347,"title":"Accuracy of multiparametric MRI for prostate cancer detection: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The purpose of this diagnostic meta-analysis was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric MRI for prostate cancer detection using anatomic T2-weighted imaging combined with two functional techniques: diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).We searched electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 3, 2012. We included diagnostic accuracy studies using a combination of T2-weighted imaging, DWI, and DCE-MRI to detect prostate cancer with histopathologic data from prostatectomy or biopsy as the reference standard. The methodologic quality was assessed with version 2 of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool by two independent reviewers. Sensitivity and specificity of all studies were calculated from 2 Ã— 2 tables, and the results were plotted in a hierarchic summary receiver operating characteristic plot.Seven studies that met the inclusion criteria (526 patients) could be analyzed. The pooled data showed a specificity of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) and sensitivity of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.81) for prostate cancer detection, with negative predictive values (NPVs) ranging from 0.65 to 0.94. Subgroup analyses showed no significant difference between the subgroups.The high specificity with variable but high NPVs and sensitivities implies a potential role for multiparametric MRI in detecting prostate cancer.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Male Urogenital
