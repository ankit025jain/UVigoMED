{"id":73542,"title":"A practice-based survey of patients dying in hospital: can we do more to support end-of-life care at home?","abstract":"An analysis of patients dying in hospital was carried out in a practice. The research showed that patients with non-malignant disease are overrepresented. Despite good district nurse support, identifying those likely to die and predicting death is more difficult than with cancer. There is a high rate of admission from nursing homes, and a reluctance by patients and relatives to discuss likely death is mirrored by uncertainty among clinicians.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24897834","annotations":[{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.636988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.599351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.549091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.489279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.361788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.341581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Home care","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_care"},{"name":"District nurse","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_nurse"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Uncertainty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Mirror (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_(computing)"},{"name":"Malapportionment","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malapportionment"},{"name":"Magnetic reluctance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_reluctance"}]}
