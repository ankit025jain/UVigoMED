{"id":3146,"title":"Investigation of long- and short-term relationships between cesarean delivery and its effective factors in Malayer.","abstract":"Recently, there has been significant increase in the number of operated cesarean compared to the overall number of birth giving. There are several factors affecting the operated cesarean in Iran compared to the birth giving which are to be reviewed in this study.The data of the study has been obtained from the registered information in Assistance Section of Health at Hamedan Faculty of Medicine which includes the seasonal data having to do with giving birth of Malayer since the beginning of Winter 2006 to the end of Fall 2013. The assimilation techniques, namely ARDL method and Error Correction Method (ECM) are the main methods to be used in this study.The short-term and long-term coefficients of abnormal view, incongruent status of fetus and pelvis, lack of progression, and the lengthy status are considered significant statistically. The ecm coefficient is -1.3456 in short-term. Also, his coefficient is significant which shows the short-term balance trend to the long-term one.The most indispensable affective factor on demanding to run the cesarean operation in short-term and long-term in Malayer are the lengthy-status, lack of progression, abnormal view, and incongruent status of fetus and pelvis, respectively.Â ","date":"2014-11-03","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363171","annotations":[{"name":"Iran","weight":0.791577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.253712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Faculty (division)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)"},{"name":"Autumn","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn"},{"name":"ECM Records","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECM_Records"},{"name":"Malayer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayer"},{"name":"Hamadan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamadan"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.0195416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Error detection and correction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction"},{"name":"Winter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Medical education","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education"},{"name":"Affect (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Cultural assimilation","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation"}]}
