{"id":83492,"title":"Care coordination: a model for the acute care hospital setting.","abstract":"To evaluate a patient care delivery model (PCDM) that redefined roles for unit-based nurse case managers and RNs to streamline care coordination processes.Aligning care coordination in acute care is essential to meet constructs of accountable care.A pre-post descriptive study design was applied to evaluate implementation of a PCDM in an acute care hospital setting. Regression and correlation analyses were used to compare length of stay (LOS), readmissions, patient satisfaction, quality measures, and cost of care.There was a significant decrease in LOS and negative patient responses related to nurse communication in the pilot PCDM unit as compared with the control unit.The model was supported as effective and will be implemented in other units in this hospital and across the healthcare system. A unit-based nurse care coordinator role is essential to facilitate interprofessional care coordination.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25340922","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.668297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.403234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.23988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Registered nurse","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_nurse"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Accountability","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Process optimization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_optimization"},{"name":"Case management (USA health system)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_management_(USA_health_system)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Social constructionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism"},{"name":"Business process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Motor coordination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination"},{"name":"Medical case management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_case_management"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Acute care","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_care"}]}
