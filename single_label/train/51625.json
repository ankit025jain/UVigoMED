{"id":51625,"title":"[Effect of Shengji Huayu Recipe on the expression of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 in skin ulcer tissue of diabetic rats].","abstract":"To study the effect of Shengji Huayu Recipe (SHR)on the expression of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 in the skin ulcer tissue of diabetic rats.The skin ulcer model was established in diabetic mice. Different compatibility proportions of SHR [the ratio of Shengji Recipe (SJR) to Huayu Recipe (HYR) = 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2, respectively] were used to intervene. The expression of MMP-3 protein in the skin ulcer of diabetic rats was detected by Western blot method,and TIMP-1 protein was detected by immunohistochemical assay.At each time point, there was no statistical difference in the blood glucose level among groups (P > 0.05). But all of them increased significantly,when compared with those of the normal wound group (P < 0.01). As for the difference between after would area treatment and before would area treatment, better effect was obtained in the SHR No. 3 group and the normal ulcer group than in the diabetic ulcer model group (P < 0.05). Results of Western blot showed that the MMP-3 protein expression was higher in the SHR No. 2 group than in the SHR No.3 group (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical results showed that TIMP-1 protein expression was lower in the SHR No. 2 group than in the SHR No. 3 group and the diabetic ulcer model group (P < 0.05). TIMP-1 protein expression was higherin the SHR No. 3 group than in the SHR No. 2 group (P < 0.01).Using SHR No.3 was conducive to the promotion of wound healing in early wound repair stage, and using SHR No. 2 might be conducive to inhibiting the formation of pathological scar.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672949","annotations":[{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.908618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.788683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.583644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.466471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.449925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.300566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"},{"name":"Recipe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recipe"}]}
