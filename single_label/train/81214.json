{"id":81214,"title":"Management of ankylosed maxillary canine with single-tooth osteotomy in conjunction with orthognathic surgery.","abstract":"Ankylosis of teeth is the abnormal adherence of alveolar bone to dentin or cementum. Ankylosis of a submerged maxillary canine can be challenging when striving for an optimal occlusal and esthetic treatment outcome with orthognathic surgery. If an ankylosed tooth does not respond to orthodontic forces, surgical procedures may be indicated to facilitate movement of the tooth to the correct position including a single-tooth segmental osteotomy to reposition the alveolar bone including the ankylosed tooth. The objective of this case report is to describe the treatment of a patient with an ankylosed submerged maxillary right canine, with a single-tooth osteotomy performed to reposition the tooth into its correct position concomitant with double-jaw orthognathic surgery and TMJ surgery.
