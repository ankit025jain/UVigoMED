{"id":31208,"title":"Effect of the ARG1 gene on arsenic resistance of 293T cells.","abstract":"To study the relationship between arsenic resistance of 293T cells and overexpression of ARG1, the ARG1 gene in a recombinant plasmid was transfected into 293T cells via liposomes, and then ARG1 overexpression was examined by real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry. The survival rate, arsenic accumulation and arsenic efflux, GSH level, and GST activity of 293T cells overexpressing ARG1 were assayed by MTT, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and DTNB, and expression of MRP-2 was detected by Western blot analysis. Compared to that in the control cells, the survival rate of ARG1 gene-overexpressing cells was much higher following exposure to lower sodium arsenite (? 8 ÂµM). When cells were exposed to lower sodium arsenite for 24 h, the arsenite content of ARG1 gene-overexpressing cells decreased and arsenic efflux increased. After 48 h, the GSH level, GST activity, and expression of MRP2 increased in a concentration-dependent manner. We conclude that the ARG1 gene increases arsenic resistance of 293T cells.","date":"2014-01-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24391030","annotations":[{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.861826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.678288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.65126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.605739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.603382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Arsenic","weight":0.327069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.303106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Sodium arsenite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_arsenite"},{"name":"Immunocytochemistry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocytochemistry"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Atomic absorption spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_absorption_spectroscopy"},{"name":"293","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/293"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Argentina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina"},{"name":"Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidrug_resistance-associated_protein_2"},{"name":"Atom","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Metallurgical assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgical_assay"}]}
