{"id":73745,"title":"Screening mammography & breast cancer mortality: meta-analysis of quasi-experimental studies.","abstract":"The magnitude of the benefit associated with screening has been debated. We present a meta-analysis of quasi-experimental studies on the effects of mammography screening.We searched MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase for articles published through January 31, 2013. Studies were included if they reported: 1) a population-wide breast cancer screening program using mammography with 5+ years of data post-implementation; 2) a comparison group with equal access to therapies; and 3) breast cancer mortality. Studies excluded were: RCTs, case-control, or simulation studies. We defined quasi-experimental as studies that compared either geographical, historical or birth cohorts with a screening program to an equivalent cohort without a screening program. Meta-analyses were conducted in Stata using the metan command, random effects. Meta-analyses were conducted separately for ages screened: under 50, 50 to 69 and over 70 and weighted by population and person-years.Among 4,903 published papers that were retrieved, 19 studies matched eligibility criteria. Birth cohort studies reported a significant benefit for women screened <age 50, but not for women screened ages 50-69. Significant reductions in breast cancer mortality were observed in historical comparisons. For geographical comparisons, there was a significant 20% reduction in mortality for women <age 50 and a significant 21-22% reduction for women ages 50-69. Studies that tested the interaction of geographical and historical comparisons produced a pooled, significant 13-17% reduction in incident breast cancer mortality for women ages 50-69, but the effects in most individual studies were non-significant. All studies of women ages 70+ were non-significant.Mammography screening may have modest effects on cancer mortality between the ages of 50 and 69 and non-significant effects for women older than age 70. Results are consistent with meta-analyses of RCTs. Effects on total mortality could not be assessed because of the limited number of studies.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24887150","annotations":[{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.723217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.650423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.460979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.324648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.279473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.274731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.149946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0602743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Random effects model","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_effects_model"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Stata","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"January 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_31"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1317","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1317"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"903","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/903"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Consistent estimator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator"},{"name":"2120s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2120s"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Breast cancer screening","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_screening"}]}
