{"id":52642,"title":"New insights into the role of connexins in pancreatic islet function and diabetes.","abstract":"Multi-cellular systems require complex signaling mechanisms for proper tissue function, to mediate signaling between cells in close proximity and at distances. This holds true for the islets of Langerhans, which are multicellular micro-organs located in the pancreas responsible for glycemic control, through secretion of insulin and other hormones. Coupling of electrical and metabolic signaling between islet ?-cells is required for proper insulin secretion and effective glycemic control. ?-cell specific coupling is established through gap junctions composed of connexin36, which results in coordinated insulin release across the islet. Islet connexins have been implicated in both Type-1 and Type-2 diabetes; however a clear link remains to be determined. The goal of this review is to discuss recent discoveries regarding the role of connexins in regulating insulin secretion, the regulation of connexins within the islet, and recent studies which support a role for connexins in diabetes. Further studies which investigate the regulation of connexins in the islet and their role in diabetes may lead to novel diabetes therapies which regulate islet function and ?-cell survival through modulation of gap junction coupling.
