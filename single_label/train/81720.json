{"id":81720,"title":"Fluoride release, recharge and flexural properties of polymethylmethacrylate containing fluoridated glass fillers.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of fluoridated glass fillers on fluoride release, recharge and the flexural properties of modified polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).Specimens of PMMA denture base material with various loading of fluoridated glass fillers (0%, 1%, 2.5%, 5% and 10% by weight) were prepared. Flexural properties were evaluated on rectangular specimens (n = 10) aged in deionized water after 24 hours, 1 and 3 months. Disc specimens (n = 10) were aged for 43 days in deionized water and lactic acid (pH 4.0) and fluoride release was measured at numerous intervals. After ageing, specimens were recharged and fluoride re-release was recorded at 1, 3 and 7 days after recharge.Samples containing 2.5%, 5% and 10% glass fillers showed significantly (p < 0.05) greater levels of fluoride release compared with the control and 1% glass fillers specimens. All experimental specimens exhibited fluoride release in both media. The flexural strength of specimens decreased in proportion to the percentage filler inclusion with the modulus of elasticity values remaining within ISO Standard 1567.The modified PMMA with fluoridated glass fillers has the ability to release and re-release fluoride ion. Flexural strength decreased as glass filler uploading increased.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861396","annotations":[{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.854301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Poly(methyl methacrylate)","weight":0.732203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)"},{"name":"Elastic modulus","weight":0.705059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus"},{"name":"Purified water","weight":0.684281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purified_water"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.52721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.48198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"International Organization for Standardization","weight":0.294293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization"},{"name":"Water fluoridation","weight":0.286952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation"},{"name":"Young's modulus","weight":0.284057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young's_modulus"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.216733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Flexural strength","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexural_strength"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Rechargeable battery","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechargeable_battery"},{"name":"Filler (materials)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(materials)"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"1567","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1567"},{"name":"Uploading and downloading","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uploading_and_downloading"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Rectangle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle"},{"name":"Bending","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Release (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_(music)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
