{"id":33299,"title":"Evaluation of neural damage in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients.","abstract":"The presence of non-progressive cognitive impairment is recognized as a common feature in a substantial proportion of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Concurrently, the amyloid beta peptide (A?42) protein has been associated with changes in memory and cognitive functions. Also, it has been shown that different subtypes of neural stem/progenitor cells (CD 34, CD 45, nestin) are involved in the innate repair of plasticity mechanisms by the injured brain, in which Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) acts as chemotactic agents to recruit such cells. Accordingly, the present study investigated levels of CD 34, CD 45, nestin and NGF in an attempt to investigate makers of neural regeneration in DMD. Neural damage was assayed in terms of A?42. Results showed that A?42 (21.9 ± 6.7 vs. 12.13 ± 4.5) was significantly increased among DMD patients compared to controls. NGF (165.8 ± 72 vs. 89.8 ± 35.9) and mononuclear cells expressing nestin (18.9 ± 6 vs. 9 ± 4), CD 45 (64 ± 5.4 vs. 53.3 ± 5.2) and CD34 (75 ± 6.2 vs. 60 ± 4.8) were significantly increased among DMD patients compared to controls. In conclusion cognitive function decline in DMD patients is associated with increased levels of A?42, which is suggested to be the cause of brain damage in such patients. The significant increase plasma NFG and in the number of mononuclear cells bearing CD34, CD45 and nestin indicates that regeneration is an ongoing process in these patients. However, this regeneration cannot counterbalance the damage induced by dystrophine mutation and increased A?42.
