{"id":84542,"title":"Polygalasaponin F inhibits secretion of inflammatory cytokines via NF-?B pathway regulation.","abstract":"To study the anti-neuroinflammatory mechanisms of polygalasaponin F (PS-F), ELISA method was used to detect the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression and phosphorylation levels. Immunofluorescence assay was used to observe the NF-?B nuclear translocation. PS-F could inhibit the release of inflammatory cytokines TNF-? and NO induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and reduce the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS). As for MAPK-signaling pathway, PS-F could only inhibit the phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK, but did not significantly affect the phosphorylation levels of JNK and ERK1/2 protein kinases. PS-F could inhibit NF-?B nuclear translocation in a dose-dependent manner. The results of Western blot assay were consistent with immunofluorescence assays. Meanwhile, p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 (20 ?M) and p65-specific inhibitor PDTC (100 ?M) were, respectively, administered as a positive control. In addition, PS-F could significantly inhibit the cytotoxicity of conditioned medium prepared by LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia (LPS conditioned media) to neuronal PC12 cells and improve cell viability. PS-F inhibits the secretions of neuroinflammatory cytokines by the regulation of NF-?B-signaling pathway.
