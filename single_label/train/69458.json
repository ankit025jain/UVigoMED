{"id":69458,"title":"Role of endorectal MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging in defining treatable intraprostatic tumor foci in prostate cancer: quantitative analysis of imaging contour compared to whole-mount histopathology.","abstract":"To investigate the role of endorectal MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging in defining the contour of treatable intraprostatic tumor foci in prostate cancer, since targeted therapy requires accurate target volume definition.We retrospectively identified 20 patients with prostate cancer who underwent endorectal MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging prior to radical prostatectomy and subsequent creation of detailed histopathological tumor maps from whole-mount step sections. Two experienced radiologists independently reviewed all MR images and electronically contoured all suspected treatable (?0.5 cm(3)) tumor foci. Deformable co-registration in MATLAB was used to calculate the margin of error between imaging and histopathological contours at both capsular and non-capsular surfaces and the treatment margin required to ensure at least 95% tumor coverage.Histopathology showed 17 treatable tumor foci in 16 patients, of which 8 were correctly identified by both readers and an additional 2 were correctly identified by reader 2. For all correctly identified lesions, both readers accurately identified that tumor contacted the prostatic capsule, with no error in contour identification. On the non-capsular border, the median distance between the imaging and histopathological contour was 1.4mm (range, 0-12). Expanding the contour by 5mm at the non-capsular margin included 95% of tumor volume not initially covered within the MR contour.Endorectal MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging can be used to accurately contour treatable intraprostatic tumor foci; adequate tumor coverage is achieved by expanding the treatment contour at the non-capsular margin by 5mm.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444524","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.784165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.692658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.69026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.633697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.615555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Image registration","weight":0.583062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.481498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.440943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.438373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.429365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.289532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.20368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"MATLAB","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Border","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Contour line","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line"},{"name":"Tetragonal crystal system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragonal_crystal_system"},{"name":"Focus (optics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(optics)"},{"name":"Margin of error","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error"}]}
