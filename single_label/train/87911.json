{"id":87911,"title":"Validation of the Brazilian version of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure III.","abstract":"The Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III) specifically assesses individuals with spinal cord injuries.To translate and validate the Brazilian version of SCIM III.SCIM III was translated, back-translated and adapted to the Portuguese language. Two interviewers assessed 83 subjects with spinal cord injuries in each one of seven collaborating rehabilitation centers. Functional Independence Measure (FIM™) and ASIA motor and sensory indices were also used. After six months, subjects were re-evaluated with the same instruments.Examiners clearly understood the Brazilian version of SCIM III. Inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.918, and test-retest ICC was 0.991. After six months, the variation of gains in the FIM™ positively correlated with gains in SCIM III.The Brazilian version of the SCIM III is easy to understand, has good psychometric properties, and is valid.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964111","annotations":[{"name":"Portuguese language","weight":0.691273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.666367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.575998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Portugal","weight":0.5221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.0681148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Federal subjects of Russia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_subjects_of_Russia"},{"name":"Smart Common Input Method","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Common_Input_Method"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Intraclass correlation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraclass_correlation"},{"name":"Finnish markka","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_markka"},{"name":"991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/991"},{"name":"918","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/918"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Cord Automobile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_Automobile"},{"name":"International Cricket Council","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Computer security","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Big Brother Brasil","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_Brasil"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Rehabilitation (penology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_(penology)"},{"name":"The Brazilian","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brazilian"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"}]}
