{"id":45661,"title":"The risk factors and quality of life in patients with overlapping functional dyspepsia or peptic ulcer disease with gastroesophageal reflux disease.","abstract":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), functional dyspepsia (FD), and peptic ulcer disease (PUD) impact the daily lives of affected individuals. The aim of this study was to compare the risk factors and impacts on life quality of overlapping FD or PUD in patients with GERD.Data from patients diagnosed with GERD were collected between January and November 2009. FD was defined using the Rome III diagnostic criteria. The overlapping GERD-FD or GERD-PUD groups were classified as concomitant GERD and FD or peptic ulcers. The characteristics of these individuals were analyzed.There were 63, 48, and 60 patients in the GERD only, overlapping GERD-FD, and overlapping GERD-PUD groups, respectively. Significantly younger age, female gender, lower body weight and body mass index, and higher rates of tea consumption were noted in the GERD-FD group. Patients in the GERD-FD group exhibited the lowest quality of life scores, both with respect to physical and mental health, on the Short Form 36 domains.Patients with concomitant GERD and FD were more likely to be younger and female. Overlapping GERD and FD had the worst impact on the quality of life of the affected individuals.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672657","annotations":[{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Dyspepsia","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspepsia"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.646788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.562161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.404832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.39665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Rome","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.253712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Tea","weight":0.220052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
