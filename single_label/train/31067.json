{"id":31067,"title":"Alcohol and substance use in multiple sclerosis.","abstract":"Few studies have examined the prevalence of alcohol and drug use in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). The current study sought to examine the prevalence and associated demographic, disease-related, and psychological correlates of substance use in an East Coast United States outpatient MS sample.157 individuals with MS completed questionnaires prior to, during or after their visit with an MS neurologist. These questionnaires included: the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C), CAGE, CAGE-Adapted to Include Drugs (CAGE-AID), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9), Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A).On the AUDIT-C, 40% of individuals with MS met or exceeded the cutoff for excessive alcohol use. They were more highly educated and younger than non-drinkers. Utilizing the CAGE, 6% of the sample met criteria for a lifetime history of excessive alcohol use and men endorsed higher rates of alcohol use than women. Only a small portion of the sample endorsed a history of drug use (CAGE-AID, 4%). Drug use was associated with greater disability and depression symptoms, but lower self-reported anxiety.Current alcohol use was prevalent in this sample, and excessive use was associated with men, younger age, and more education. Reported drug use was minimal and associated with greater disability, more self-reported depression, but fewer anxiety symptoms.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411661","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.874168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.815841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.815553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.755699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Neurologist","weight":0.703919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurologist"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.663049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.60393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.587058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.481271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.422866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.413988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.341581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"History","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Beck","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Patient Health Questionnaire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Health_Questionnaire"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Minimalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism"},{"name":"East Coast of the United States","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States"}]}
