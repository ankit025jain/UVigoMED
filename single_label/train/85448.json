{"id":85448,"title":"Linking patient-centered medical home and asthma measures reduces hospital readmission rates.","abstract":"We sought to achieve 100% compliance with all 3 Children's Asthma Care (CAC; CAC-1, CAC-2, CAC-3) measures and track attendance at follow-up appointments with the patient-centered medical home. The impact of these measures on readmission and emergency department utilization rates was evaluated.This quality improvement study evaluated compliance with CAC measures in pediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years old hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of asthma from January 1, 2008, through June 30, 2012. A multidisciplinary Asthma Task Force was assembled to develop interventions. Attendance at the follow-up appointment was tracked monthly from January 1, 2009. Readmission and emergency department utilization rates were compared between the preimplementation period (January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2007) and the postimplementation period (January 1, 2008, through June 30, 2012).The preimplementation period included 231 subjects and the postimplementation period included 532 subjects. Compliance with CAC-3 was 95% from October 1, 2009, through June 30, 2012. Compliance with the postdischarge follow-up appointment was 69% from January 1, 2009 through September 30, 2009, increasing significantly to 90% from October 1, 2009, through June 30, 2012 (P < .001). Postimplementation readmission rates significantly decreased in the 91- to 180-day postdischarge interval (odds ratio: 0.29; 95% confidence interval: 0.11-0.78).In children hospitalized with asthma, compliance with the asthma core measures and the postdischarge follow-up appointment with the primary care provider was associated with reduced readmission rates at 91 to 180 days after discharge. We attribute our results to a comprehensive set of interventions designed by our multidisciplinary Asthma Task Force.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24936001","annotations":[{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.664832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.617501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.423585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.371358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.235256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Medical home","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_home"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"June 30","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_30"},{"name":"October 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_1"},{"name":"Property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property"},{"name":"September 30","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_30"},{"name":"1969","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Continuous track","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_track"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Track and field","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field"},{"name":"Task force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_force"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"List of sports attendance figures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_attendance_figures"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"California State Route 91","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_91"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"}]}
