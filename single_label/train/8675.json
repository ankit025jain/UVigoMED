{"id":8675,"title":"Discovering up-regulated VEGF-C expression in swine umbilical vein endothelial cells by classical swine fever virus Shimen.","abstract":"Infection of domestic swine with the highly virulent Shimen strain of classical swine fever virus causes hemorrhagic lymphadenitis and diffuse hemorrhaging in infected swine. We analyzed patterns of gene expression for CSFV Shimen in swine umbilical vein endothelial cells (SUVECs). Transcription of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) C gene (VEGF-C) and translation of the corresponding protein were significantly up-regulated in SUVECs. Our findings suggest that VEGF-C is involved in mechanisms of acute infection caused by virulent strains of CSFV.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758593","annotations":[{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.879114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.78094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.778631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.771442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.689941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.680803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Classical swine fever","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_swine_fever"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.156906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor C","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_C"},{"name":"Umbilical vein","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_vein"},{"name":"Domestic pig","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"}]}
