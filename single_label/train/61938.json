{"id":61938,"title":"PI3K? inhibition hits a sensitive spot in B cell malignancies.","abstract":"A PI3K?-selective inhibitor shows impressive clinical activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and indolent BÂ cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. In these malignancies, the PI3K pathway is not mutationally activated as in many other cancers, but it is important for mediating supportive cues from the cancer microenvironment and the B cell antigen receptor.
