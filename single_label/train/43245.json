{"id":43245,"title":"Impaired 8-hydroxyguanine repair activity of MUTYH variant p.Arg109Trp found in a Japanese patient with early-onset colorectal cancer.","abstract":"The biallelic inactivation of the 8-hydroxyguanine repair gene MUTYH leads to MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), which is characterized by colorectal multiple polyps and carcinoma(s). However, only limited information regarding MAP in the Japanese population is presently available. Since early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) is a characteristic of MAP and might be caused by the inactivation of another 8-hydroxyguanine repair gene, OGG1, we investigated whether germline MUTYH and OGG1 mutations are involved in early-onset CRC in Japanese patients.Thirty-four Japanese patients with early-onset CRC were examined for germline MUTYH and OGG1 mutations using sequencing.Biallelic pathogenic mutations were not found in any of the patients; however, a heterozygous p.Arg19???MUTYH variant and a heterozygous p.Arg109Trp MUTYH variant were detected in one patient each. The p.Arg19? and p.Arg109Trp corresponded to p.Arg5? and p.Arg81Trp, respectively, in the type 2 nuclear-form protein. The defective DNA repair activity of p.Arg5? is apparent, while that of p.Arg81Trp has been demonstrated using DNA cleavage and supF forward mutation assays.These results suggest that biallelic MUTYH or OGG1 pathogenic mutations are rare in Japanese patients with early-onset CRC; however, the p.Arg19? and p.Arg109Trp MUTYH variants are associated with functional impairments.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24799981","annotations":[{"name":"Allele","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.756459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.73253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Tryptophan","weight":0.707053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.57761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.443645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"MUTYH","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUTYH"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.254042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Oxoguanine glycosylase","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxoguanine_glycosylase"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Polyposis","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyposis"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Cleavage (embryo)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(embryo)"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.0111494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"}]}
