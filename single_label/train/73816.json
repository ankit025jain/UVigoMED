{"id":73816,"title":"P53/microRNA-34-induced metabolic regulation: new opportunities in anticancer therapy.","abstract":"MicroRNA-34 (miR-34) is directly regulated by p53, and its potential tumor suppressive roles have been studied extensively. As a p53-induced microRNA, miR-34 functions as a tumor suppressor by playing a role in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and metabolic regulation. Among these p53/miR-34 associated processes, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest are known as essential for p53/miR-34-mediated tumor suppression. P53-mediated metabolic processes have been shown to play pivotal roles in cancer cell biology. Recent studies have also identified several miR-34 targets involved in p53/miR-34-induced metabolic regulation. However, correlations among these metabolic targets remain to be fully elucidated. In this review, we summarize the current progress in the field of metabolic regulation by the p53/miR-34 axis and propose future directions for the development of metabolic approaches in anticancer therapy.
