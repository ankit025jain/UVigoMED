{"id":53414,"title":"Intractable nausea in a patient with synchronous pancreatic cancer and a fourth-ventricular ependymoma.","abstract":"Symptoms of nausea and vomiting can present a diagnostic challenge for physicians. In this article, we report a patient who was found to have synchronous presentation of an ependymoma and pancreatic cancer. This case illustrates some of the diagnostic challenges in patients with constitutional symptoms. Furthermore, it illustrates the importance of surgical intervention as both a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic measure when managing patients with presumed metastatic disease to the brain.
