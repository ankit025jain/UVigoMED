{"id":21278,"title":"Informal consultation at a teaching hospital infectious diseases department.","abstract":"Informal consultations for advice in the infectious diseases department (IDD) induce a significant workload for physicians. Our aim was to retrospectively quantify and describe this activity in our institution.The data was obtained from files documented and faxed by physicians from October 2009 to May 2012. One thousand nine hundred and seventy-two files were included. The file was faxed to the IDD specialist, analyzed, then a telephone conversation allowed making precisions, and the documented form was faxed back.The requests for advice concerned 39% of female and 61% of male patients with a mean age of 64Â±21 years. Twenty-nine percent of requests came from surgical departments and 71% from medical departments (P<0.01). The departments most frequently concerned were cardiology (10%), gastro-enterology (10%) and cardiovascular surgery (9.7%). The most frequent infections were urogenital (19%), osteoarticular (14%), and cardiovascular (11%). Forty-nine percent were considered as nosocomial and 25.3% were bacteremic. The requests concerned diagnostic aid in 16.2% of cases and therapeutic issues in 95.6%. The IDD specialist made therapeutic recommendation in 96.5% of cases and gave diagnostic advice in 43.7%. Treatment modification was suggested in 38.5% of cases. Twenty-two percent of consultations required a second one.This study documented the importance of antibiotic changes among medical and surgical units, the increasing need of these units to be helped, and also the complexity of the medical cases, all requiring the advice of an ID specialist. Our fax-phone-fax procedure seems to prevent the bias associated with informal consultations by phone, which is the most commonly used in other institutions.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612506","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.762393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.707851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.668921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.647608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Idaho","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Conversation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"}]}
