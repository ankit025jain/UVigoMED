{"id":29013,"title":"[Home aides and families faced with alcoholic behavior in elderly people].","abstract":"Alcoholic behaviour in elderly people living at home leads to the establishment of a singular relationship between the family and the home helpers. The professionals have a special role within the family system but one which at the same time is, paradoxically, limited. The intervention of a third party, in the framework of an alcoholism support network, can help to avoid the breakdown of the care within the home as a result of the mental exhaustion of the various players, as well as the occurrence of conflicts within the family circle in the home.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745121","annotations":[{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.308015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.259055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.16068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Family therapy","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_therapy"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.120466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Paradox","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Television network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_network"},{"name":"Grammatical number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number"},{"name":"Emergency service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Political party","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party"},{"name":"Divorce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce"},{"name":"Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home"},{"name":"Conceptual framework","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework"}]}
