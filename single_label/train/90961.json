{"id":90961,"title":"Effect of surgical repair of the joint capsule in mandibular condyle fractures in adult rats.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to assess histologic changes in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) of adult rats subjected to unilateral fracture of the mandibular condyle and soft tissue injury.The animals were divided into 2 groups: one had surgical treatment for soft tissue repair and the other had no soft tissue treatment. All histologic evaluations were performed according to the presence or absence of synovitis, vascularity, presence or absence of joint inflammation, and presence or absence of the articular disc. The contralateral TMJs also were evaluated.The results showed few histologic changes in the synovial membrane and joint disc for the 2Â groups and in the synovial membrane and disc of the contralateral side, where indirect trauma occurred in the unoperated joint.This study showed that treating or not treating soft tissues does not change the treatment results of condyle fracture or interfere with TMJ pathosis.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560172","annotations":[{"name":"Articular disk","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular_disk"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.851987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.750663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.748946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Articular capsule","weight":0.540409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular_capsule"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.349941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.255405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.245833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.161443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.0918626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"Tissue engineering","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_engineering"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Synovitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovitis"},{"name":"Condyloid process","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyloid_process"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Soft tissue injury","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue_injury"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
