{"id":36835,"title":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease variants-classification, clinical, and genetic features and rational diagnostic evaluation.","abstract":"Inherited neuropathies are among the most prevalent inherited neurologic disorders, and with current advances in molecular biology and genetic testing, the clinical spectrum of phenotype/genotype has been expanding enormously. Genetic testing is nowadays commercially available to several subtypes although many remain because of unknown genetic defect. A stepwise rational approach, which is shown in , facilitates reaching a specific diagnosis and reduces the cost.
