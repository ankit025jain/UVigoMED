{"id":35934,"title":"The myocardial function during and after whole-body therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, a cohort study.","abstract":"Therapeutic hypothermia has become standard treatment for moderate and severe neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) to reduce cerebral morbidity and mortality. The effect on the heart is incompletely explored.To assess the myocardial function during and after whole-body therapeutic hypothermia for HIE.Observational cohort study.Forty-four infants with HIE cooled for 72hours were compared with 48 healthy term infants and 20 normothermic infants with HIE.Tissue Doppler deformation indices of myocardial function (peak systolic strain, peak systolic strain-rate, early diastole strain-rate and strain-rate in atrial systole) during (days 1 and 3) and after (day 4) therapeutic hypothermia.On days one and three all indices in both HIE groups were lower than the corresponding indices in the healthy infants. The two HIE groups had similar indices, except peak systolic strain-rate on days 1 and 3 and strain-rate in atrial systole on day 1. All strain-rate indices improved from day 3 to 4 (after rewarming) in the cooled group and achieved similar values to those in healthy infants on day 3. All indices were higher in the cooling-group after rewarming than in the normothermic infants with HIE on day 3, except early diastolic strain-rate.Infants with HIE had similarly impaired myocardial function during days 1-3 whether normothermic or hypothermic. The myocardial function improved significantly at day 4 (after rewarming), approaching the day 3 levels in the healthy neonates.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612933","annotations":[{"name":"Therapeutic hypothermia","weight":0.816171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_hypothermia"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.798934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.78094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.734154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardiac cycle","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_cycle"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.659673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.441392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.374283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Doppler echocardiography","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_echocardiography"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
