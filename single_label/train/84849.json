{"id":84849,"title":"Patellofemoral arthroplasty influences tibiofemoral kinematics: the effect of patellar thickness.","abstract":"Although controversy still remains, isolated patellofemoral arthroplasty recently gained in popularity as a treatment option for patellofemoral osteoarthritis. It has compared to total knee arthroplasty the advantage of preserving the tibiofemoral articulation, which in theory would allow the preservation of natural tibiofemoral kinematics. Today, however, no data exist to support this assumption. This study was therefore performed in order to investigate the effect of isolated patellofemoral arthroplasty on the native three-dimensional tibiofemoral kinematic behaviour and whether a change in patellar thickness would have an influence.Six fresh-frozen cadavers were fixed on a custom-made mechanical knee rig. Full 3D kinematics was analysed during passive flexion-extension cycles, open chain extension, with and without mechanical resistance, as well as deep knee squats, using infrared motion capture cameras and retroflective markers. Measurements were taken for the native knee and after prosthetic trochlear resurfacing with and without patellar resurfacing in three different patellar thicknesses.Compared to the natural knee, patellofemoral arthroplasty resulted in significant changes in tibiofemoral kinematics, which were most pronounced in the most loaded motor tasks. Increased internal tibial rotation was noted in the mid- and high flexion ranges, reaching at 120° of flexion a mean difference of 4.5°±4.3° (p<0.0001) during squat motion, over the whole flexion range during open chain motion and in deeper flexion beyond 50° (mean at 70°, 1.9°±3.7°) during resisted open chain. During squats, also, a more posterior translation of the lateral femoral condyle was observed. The effect was accentuated in case of patella overstuffing, whereas kinematics was closer to normal with patellar thinning.Isolated patellofemoral arthroplasty alters natural tibiofemoral kinematics, and the effects become more pronounced in case of increased patellar thickness. Therefore, it might be recommended to aim for a slight over-resection of patellar bone if sufficient bone stock is available.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
