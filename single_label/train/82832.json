{"id":82832,"title":"Trends in dental caries among Brazilian schoolchildren: 40 years of monitoring (1971-2011).","abstract":"The study aimed to estimate the prevalence, severity, and inequality in the distribution of dental caries in schoolchildren from Florian√≥polis, Santa Catarina, Brazil, in 2011, and to compare the results with data from previous studies carried out since 1971. All 12- and 13-year-old schoolchildren enrolled in a public school were eligible. Dental caries were assessed according to the World Health Organisation diagnostic criteria. Decayed, missing and filled surfaces and teeth (DMFS/DMFT) indexes, the Significant Caries Index (SiC) and the Gini coefficient (to assess inequalities in the distribution of dental caries) were estimated. The response rate was 82.3% (n = 130). The prevalence of dental caries decreased from 98.0% (95% CI 96.0-100.0) in 1971 to 36.9% (95% CI 28.5-45.3) in 2011. The mean DMFT ranged from 9.2 in 1971 to 0.7 in 2011. The mean DMFS index was 1.2 (95% CI 0.8-1.6) in 2011. The Gini coefficient was 0.624 in 2002 but increased to 0.725 in 2011; the Lorenz curve showed that 70-75% of dental caries attacks was restricted to 20% of the population in 2011. A reduction of 41.2% in the mean SiC index was observed between 2002 (3.4, 95% CI 3.0-3.8) and 2011 (1.9, 95% CI 1.6-2.1). An effective decline in the prevalence and severity of dental caries in schoolchildren was observed throughout 40 years of monitoring. However, a small proportion of the population has experienced most of the caries burden in the recent years studied.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506796","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.856654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.543743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.469715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Gini coefficient","weight":0.411798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.371162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.17761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Economic inequality","weight":0.16552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0713771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Lorenz curve","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_curve"},{"name":"Santa Catarina (state)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catarina_(state)"},{"name":"Decomposition","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0177991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"624","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/624"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"725","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/725"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Trends (short story)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trends_(short_story)"},{"name":"7075 aluminium alloy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7075_aluminium_alloy"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Uncial 0100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0100"},{"name":"Silicon","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon"}]}
