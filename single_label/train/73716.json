{"id":73716,"title":"p62/SQSTM1 synergizes with autophagy for tumor growth in vivo.","abstract":"Autophagy is crucial for cellular homeostasis and plays important roles in tumorigenesis. FIP200 (FAK family-interacting protein of 200 kDa) is an essential autophagy gene required for autophagy induction, functioning in the ULK1-ATG13-FIP200 complex. Our previous studies showed that conditional knockout of FIP200 significantly suppressed mammary tumorigenesis, which was accompanied by accumulation of p62 in tumor cells. However, it is not clear whether FIP200 is also required for maintaining tumor growth and how the increased p62 level affects the growth in autophagy-deficient FIP200-null tumors in vivo. Here, we describe a new system to delete FIP200 in transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts as well as mammary tumor cells following their transplantation and show that ablation of FIP200 significantly reduced growth of established tumors in vivo. Using similar strategies, we further showed that either p62 knockdown or p62 deficiency in established FIP200-null tumors dramatically impaired tumor growth. The stimulation of tumor growth by p62 accumulation in FIP200-null tumors is associated with the up-regulated activation of the NF-?B pathway by p62. Last, we showed that overexpression of the autophagy master regulator TFEB(S142A) increased the growth of established tumors, which correlated with the increased autophagy of the tumor cells. Together, our studies demonstrate that p62 and autophagy synergize to promote tumor growth, suggesting that inhibition of both pathways could be more effective than targeting either alone for cancer therapy.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888590","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.805784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.777841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.667691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.628038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.587964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.496062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.409501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.334811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.251242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"PTK2","weight":0.145948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTK2"},{"name":"Mammary tumor","weight":0.0639325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_tumor"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.0312962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Anti-thymocyte globulin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-thymocyte_globulin"},{"name":"Null allele","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_allele"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
