{"id":83349,"title":"Clinical case of a patient diagnosed with sinister inguinal hernia and disembriogenesis of the inguinal canal.","abstract":"Hernia (lat. - rupture, burst) or protrusion represents the act of escape of tissue, organ or an organ constituent through an innate or acquired fault of the muscle or the connective tissue membrane. The inguinal hernia, also known as groin hernia, rates one of the most frequent surgical conditions. It is manifested by all ages, however is more common in males. The inguinal hernia exhibits by the protrusion of abdominal organs or their segments, for instance portions of the small or large intestine, into the inguinal canal. The groin hernias classify into two subtypes--direct and indirect, and also acquired and inherited. Two kind of anomalies exist--anomalies connected with the obliteration of processus vaginalis peritonei and anomalies connected with the embryogenessis of the inguinal canal. We present a clinical case of a 59-years-old male presenting with emerged arch-like protuberance in the sinister groin region, enlarging during physical effort and strain, accompanied by a strong, harsh pain. Intraoperatively it was discovered a disembryogenessis of the inguinal canal, a total lack of the front wall of the canal itself, a lack of formed superficial inguinal opening and inobliterated processus vaginalis peritonei.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417274","annotations":[{"name":"Inguinal hernia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_hernia"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.821942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Large intestine","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.775896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.672482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Groin","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groin"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.371548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Exophthalmos","weight":0.359797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophthalmos"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.356946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Latin","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.244178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Inguinal canal","weight":0.188889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_canal"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Processus vaginalis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processus_vaginalis"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"}]}
