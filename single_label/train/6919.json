{"id":6919,"title":"[Adenoviral short hairpin RNA targeting phosphodiesterase 5 attenuates cardiac remodeling and cardiac dysfunction following myocardial infarction in mice].","abstract":"To observe the impact of PDE5shRNA on cardiac remodeling and heart function following myocardial infarction in mice.Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in mice by left coronary artery ligation. Mice were randomly assigned to sham group (n = 6), PDE5shRNA group (n = 12), common adenovirus group (n = 15) and DMEM group (n = 8). Four weeks post-MI, the survival rate was evaluated. Cardiac function was examined by echocardiography. HE staining and Masson staining were used to evaluate the myocardial infarction size and fibrosis. The number of blood vessels was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, PDE5 protein expression in the left ventricular was detected using Western blot, level of cGMP or PKG activity in the left ventricle was evaluated with ELISA.Four weeks post-MI, all mice survived in the sham group, 3(37%) mice died in the DMEM group, 1 (8%) died in the PDE5shRNA group and 5 died in the common adenovirus group (33%). Infarct size was significantly reduced in PDE5shRNA group compared with the common adenovirus group and DMEM group [(25.4 ± 2.9)% vs. (42.0 ± 3.2)% and (43.4 ± 2.6) %, P < 0.05]. Cardiac function was significantly improved in PDE5shRNA group compared to common adenovirus group and DMEM group[LVFS: (21.1 ± 3.7)% vs. (14.2 ± 2.9)% and (14.22 ± 2.91)%, all P < 0.05; LVEF: (48.2 ± 7.1)% vs. (34.6 ± 6.2)% and (38.1 ± 2.8)%, all P < 0.05; LVESD: (3.87 ± 0.45) mm vs.(4.91 ± 0.62) mm and (4.63 ± 0.37) mm, all P < 0.05]. The blood vessel density was also higher in PDE5shRNA group compared with common adenovirus group (infarct area:14.3 ± 2.0 vs. 6.6 ± 1.2, P < 0.05; periinfarct area: 23.6 ± 2.1 vs. 13.7 ± 2.4, P < 0.05). Compared with common adenovirus group, level of PDE5 was significantly downregulated and level of cGMP or PKG was significantly upregulated in PDE5shRNA group (all P < 0.05).Present study suggests PDE5shRNA improves cardiac function and attenuates cardiac remodeling through reducing infarction size and cardiac fibrosis and these beneficial effects are possibly mediated by activating cGMP/PKG signaling pathway.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24924460","annotations":[{"name":"Western
