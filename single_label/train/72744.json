{"id":72744,"title":"[Advance in studies on long-circulating tumor targeted compound preparations].","abstract":"Tumor has long been a hard-nut problem in the world medical field. The effect of the conventional drugs is very limited because of the intervention of multiple micro-environmental factors during the occurrence and progression of tumors. With the characteristics of high efficiency, low toxicity and multi-targets synergistic effect, the long-circulating tumor targeted compound preparations show its unique advantages in improving tumor microenvironment and enhancing the therapeutic effect of treatment, thus it has gradually become a hotspot of studies both at home and abroad. Through consulting a great number of professional literatures at home and abroad in recent years, the authors summarized the current studies in vitro and in vive on long-circulating tumor targeted compound preparations in different carriers, in the expectation of providing new ideas and methods for the development of long-circulating tumor targeted compound preparations.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946538","annotations":[{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.492017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.400781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.288519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Aircraft carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier"},{"name":"Expected value","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Vive, Viva","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vive,_Viva"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Efficient energy use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use"},{"name":"Hotspot (geology)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_(geology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
