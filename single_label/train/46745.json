{"id":46745,"title":"Three-dimensional computed tomography image based endovascular treatment for hepatic vein.","abstract":"Along with the expansion of living donor liver transplantation, whereby hepatic venous anastomosis is mandatory, the frequency of hepatic venous stenosis that need interventional treatment is increasing. Due to its anatomical features, there are several pitfalls in the process of endovascular intervention for hepatic vein. Insufficient information of and around the hepatic vein may lead to miss-diagnosis of target lesion. Simulation by using three-dimensional computed tomography images was useful in planning the direction of X-ray projection and, as a consequence, contributed to safe endovascular treatment for hepatic venous stenosis.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620644","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.837652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.701037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.624187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.498877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.454902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.223041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Hepatic vein","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_vein"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.0777877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Living donor liver transplantation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_donor_liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"}]}
