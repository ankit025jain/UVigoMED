{"id":17197,"title":"High tuberculosis prevalence in children exposed at home to drug-resistant tuberculosis.","abstract":"Urban Karachi, Pakistan.To describe the yield of a contact investigation protocol implemented among children living with drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) patients.We implemented a contact investigation protocol in households of DR-TB patients treated at the Indus Hospital, Karachi, between January 2008 and April 2011. This included a detailed history and physical examination, tuberculin skin test, chest radiograph, smear microscopy and culture of sputum or gastric aspirate specimens, and drug susceptibility testing. Treatment supporters who visited DR-TB patients at home referred all child contacts for baseline evaluation and performed monthly assessments. We evaluated two age groups: 1) children aged <5 years, and 2) those aged 5-14 years.Among 133 children aged <15 years in 40 households, 40.4% (51/125) were moderately to severely underweight (weight-for-age Z-score <-2). Overall, 7.5% (10/133) had TB disease. This proportion was 6.5% (2/31) in those aged <5 years and 7.8% (8/102) in those aged 5-14 years. Seven (7/10) were smear-positive, and 4/10 had culture-confirmed multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosisWe detected a high prevalence of TB in children who live with DR-TB patients, regardless of the age of the child. Child contacts of DR-TB patients are a high-yield population for detecting TB cases.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903786","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Chest radiograph","weight":0.8445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_radiograph"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.816971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.805736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.778221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.751928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.63101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.556261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.483456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.331007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.224274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Karachi","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.186121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Tuberculin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Underweight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underweight"},{"name":"710","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/710"},{"name":"410","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/410"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Supporter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supporter"},{"name":"Smear campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Indus River","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_River"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"}]}
