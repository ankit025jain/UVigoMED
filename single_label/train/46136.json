{"id":46136,"title":"Comparison of acute hepatitis E infection outcome in patients with and without chronic hepatitis B infection: a 10 year retrospective study in three regional hospitals in Hong Kong.","abstract":"Acute hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has recently become the commonest cause of acute viral hepatitis in Hong Kong (HK) with majority of HEV belonging to genotype 4. Studies from China have shown that acute hepatitis E patients with underlying chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may have a worse outcome than those without. In India where genotype 1 is more prevalent, superinfection with hepatitis E on patients with chronic liver disease including chronic hepatitis B infection can cause liver decompensation.The study aims to determine the clinical outcome of acute hepatitis E infection in patients with and without chronic hepatitis B infection in HK.The rates of liver failure, liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality will be compared between acute hepatitis E patients with and without chronic hepatitis B. Analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS version 12.0). All statistical tests were two-sided, and statistical significance was taken as p<0.05.Chronic HBV carriers with acute HEV infection were found to have higher liver failure rate, liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality, but the results did not reach statistical significance. Chronic HBV carriers were found to have statistically significantly lower admission ALT level, lower day 28 serum albumin level and higher day 28 serum ALT level.A prospective study with sufficient sample size is needed to confirm whether the clinical outcome of patients with chronic HBV infection is worse compared with patients who were not chronic HBV carriers.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646686","annotations":[{"name":"Superinfection","weight":0.833244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superinfection"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Hepatitis E","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_E"},{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"India","weight":0.777234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.737516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.700817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.698675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.52159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hong Kong","weight":0.452892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Hepatitis E virus","weight":0.270612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_E_virus"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.206224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Science (journal)","weight":0.041581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Social sciences","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Chronic liver disease","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_liver_disease"}]}
