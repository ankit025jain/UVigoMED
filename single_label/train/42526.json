{"id":42526,"title":"[Roles of hMMS2 gene in reversing the oxaliplatin tolerance of human colon carcinoma cells].","abstract":"In this study, the roles of hMMS2 (human methyl methanesulfonate sensitive mutant 2) gene encoding the human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 2 in the drug resistance in human colon carcinoma were investigated by using a well-differentiated human colorectal carcinoma L-OHP-resistant cell line, THC8307/L-OHP. THC8307/L-OHP cells were transfected via liposome along with plasmid pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-MMS2 expressing both miRNA against hMMS2 and GFP, followed by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence to select stable transfectants with significantly reduced hMMS2 expression. Compared with untransfected or pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP vector-transfected cells, the hMMS2-depleted cells displayed significantly (P<0.05) reduced half inhibition concentration(IC50) resistance index (RI) and colony-forming efficiency (CFE) upon treatment with oxaliplatin (L-OHP), while its relative reverse efficiency(RRE) was significantly higher (P<0.05) than the control cells, indicating compromised ability of cell proliferation. Indeed, Rho-damine 123 staining and flow cytometry analyses revealed an increased rate of apoptosis in hMMS2-depleted cells while no difference in cell proliferation or apoptosis was observed between the two control cell lines. The above observations collec-tively indicate that suppression of hMMS2 reverses L-OHP tolerance in differentiated human colorectal carcinoma cells by promoting apoptosis.
