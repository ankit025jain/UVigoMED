{"id":10359,"title":"Immunological evaluation of mannosylated chitosan nanoparticles based foot and mouth disease virus DNA vaccine, pVAC FMDV VP1-OmpA in guinea pigs.","abstract":"A DNA vaccine for foot and mouth disease (FMD) based on mannosylated chitosan nanoparticles was evaluated in guinea pigs. The DNA construct was comprised of FMD virus full length-VP1 gene and outer membrane protein A (Omp A) gene of Salmonella typhimurium as a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-ligand in pVAC vector. Groups of guinea pigs immunized either intramuscularly or intra-nasally were evaluated for induction of virus neutralizing antibodies, Th1(IgG2) and Th2 (IgG1) responses, lymphocyte proliferation, reactive nitrogen intermediate production, secretory IgA for naso-mucosal immune response and protection upon homotypic type O virulent FMD virus challenge. The results indicate the synergistic effect of OmpA on the immunogenic potential of FMD DNA vaccine construct delivered using mannosylated chitosan nano-particles by different routes of administration. These observations suggest the substantial improvement in all the immunological parameters with enhanced protection in guinea pigs.
