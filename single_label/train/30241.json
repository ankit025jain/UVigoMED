{"id":30241,"title":"A phase III randomized, placebo-controlled study of topical amitriptyline and ketamine for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): a University of Rochester CCOP study of 462 cancer survivors.","abstract":"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) occurs in as high as 70% of patients receiving certain types of chemotherapy agents. The FDA has yet to approve a therapy for CIPN. The aim of this multicenter, phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to investigate the efficacy of 2% ketamine plus 4% amitriptyline (KA) cream for reducing CIPN.Cancer survivors who completed chemotherapy at least 1 month prior and had CIPN (>4 out of 10) were enrolled (N=462). CIPN was assessed using average scores from a 7-day daily diary that asks patients to rate the average \"pain, numbness, or tingling in [their] hands and feet over the past 24 h\" on an 11-point numeric rating scale at baseline and 6 weeks post intervention. ANCOVA was used to measure differences in 6-week CIPN with effects including baseline CIPN, KA treatment arm, and previous taxane therapy (Y/N).The KA treatment showed no effect on 6-week CIPN scores (adjusted mean difference=-0.17, p=0.363).This study suggests that KA cream does not decrease CIPN symptoms in cancer survivors.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531792","annotations":[{"name":"Amitriptyline","weight":0.90816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitriptyline"},{"name":"Ketamine","weight":0.899747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.847604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Paresthesia","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Taxane","weight":0.794008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxane"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.669984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"University of Rochester","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Rochester"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Analysis of covariance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_covariance"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"363","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/363"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Newton (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Knight or Dame of St. Andrew (Barbados)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_or_Dame_of_St._Andrew_(Barbados)"},{"name":"Diary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"},{"name":"Rating scale","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_scale"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Rochester, New York","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"}]}
