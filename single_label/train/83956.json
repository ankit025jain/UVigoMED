{"id":83956,"title":"[Status quo of external therapies with traditional Chinese medicines on edema].","abstract":"Edema, as one of common clinical diseases, could be treated by taking medicines and adopting external therapies with traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). In recent years, there have been many clinical and basic studies concerning external therapies with TCM on edema Data showed that the external therapies are mostly composed of such purgating drugs as Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Natrii Sulfas and Pharbitidis Semen, heat-clearing drug such as Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex and resuscitation-inducing drug such as Borneolum Syntheticum. The study showed that ingredients of external therapies did not pass through hilum and hepatic system, and thus avoided the first pass effect of livers. They enabled effective components of drugs to be rapidly absorbed through pores and skins, strengthened the effect against edema, shortened the treatment course, decreased side effects, and were convenient and inexpensive. External therapies with TCM could play unique advantages in inhibiting edema in the future clinical studies.","date":"2014-09-10","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25204162","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.740761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"China","weight":0.257943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Sweat gland","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_gland"},{"name":"First pass effect","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_effect"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Ingredient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingredient"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Status quo","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
