{"id":53042,"title":"Relationship between patient satisfactions with diabetes care and treatment.","abstract":"Measurement of treatment satisfaction in diabetes is important as it has been shown to be associated with positive outcomes, reduced disease cost and better health.The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between treatment satisfaction of diabetes patients and socioeconomic, clinical, medication adherence and health-related factors in Qatar.This is a cross-sectional study.The survey was carried out in primary health care centers and hospitals from April 2010 to May 2011.Of a total of 3000 diabetic patients, 2582 patients gave their consent to take part in the study, with a response rate of 86.1%.The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire was used to measure the patient satisfaction. The modified Morisky Medication Adherence was used to measure medication taking behavior. A multivariate stepwise linear regression model was performed to identify factors independently associated with patients' satisfaction instrument.Of the studied patients, majority of the diabetes patients were Qataris (61.2%), married (86.1%), above secondary education (46.9%) and unemployed (28.6%). Diabetes patients who had professional jobs (3.97 ± 0.65; P = 0.009) and those who were staying alone had a significantly higher treatment satisfaction score (4.01 ± 0.64; P = 0.001) compared with the other patients. Patients who were taking tablets were significantly more satisfied with treatment (4.08 ± 0.60; P < 0.001). Diabetes patients of primary health care centers (3.96 vs. 3.80; P < 0.001) were more satisfied with treatment than patients visiting hospitals. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that age of the patient (P < 0.001), expatriates (P = 0.023), patients visiting hospitals (P < 0.001), treatment with insulin (P < 0.001) and any diabetes complications (P < 0.001) were significantly less satisfied with the treatment.The study findings revealed that patient satisfaction was positively associated with sociodemographic variables like high income, employment, married individuals and those with higher levels of education. We found a lower treatment satisfaction in patients with diabetes-related complications and insulin treatment.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553035","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.734551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.719037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.583817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.562303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.541392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Unemployment","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.426857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.413174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.363198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.328414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.298768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Qatar","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar"},{"name":"Primary health care","weight":0.249069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_health_care"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.157879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.107822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Educational attainment in the United States","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Expatriate","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expatriate"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"United Kingdom general election, 2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"}]}
