{"id":17160,"title":"Energy crisis: the role of oxidative phosphorylation in acute inflammation and sepsis.","abstract":"Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as an accomplice in most of the common human diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, diabetes, ischemia/reperfusion injury as seen in myocardial infarction and stroke, and sepsis. Inflammatory conditions, both acute and chronic, have recently been shown to affect mitochondrial function. We here discuss the role of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), focusing on acute inflammatory conditions, in particular sepsis and experimental sepsis models. We discuss mitochondrial alterations, specifically the suppression of oxidative metabolism and the role of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in disease pathology. Several signaling pathways including metabolic, proliferative, and cytokine signaling affect mitochondrial function and appear to be important in inflammatory disease conditions. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and cytochrome c, the latter of which plays a central role in apoptosis in addition to mitochondrial respiration, serve as examples for the entire OxPhos system since they have been studied in more detail with respect to cell signaling. We propose a model in which inflammatory signaling leads to changes in the phosphorylation state of mitochondrial proteins, including Tyr304 phosphorylation of COX catalytic subunit I. This results in an inhibition of OxPhos, a reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and consequently a lack of energy, which can cause organ failure and death as seen in septic patients.
