{"id":12929,"title":"Absence of coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, and influenza A viruses in seabirds in the southwestern Indian Ocean.","abstract":"We investigated circulation of coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, and influenza A viruses in eight seabird species of the southwestern Indian Ocean. Viruses were not detected by real-time polymerase chain reactions in the 338 tested cloacal swab samples, supporting that they did not circulate in the studied colonies at the time of sampling.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502741","annotations":[{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.803683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Seabird","weight":0.687364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabird"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Indian Ocean","weight":0.598005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean"},{"name":"Influenza A virus","weight":0.260586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.175612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Paramyxovirus","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramyxovirus"},{"name":"Ocean","weight":0.103477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Cloaca","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Coronavirus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 338","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_338"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Nuclear chain reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Southwestern United States","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States"},{"name":"Absenteeism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absenteeism"}]}
