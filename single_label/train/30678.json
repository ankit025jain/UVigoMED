{"id":30678,"title":"A signal peptide missense mutation associated with nicotine dependence alters ?2*-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor function.","abstract":"A cytosine to thymidine (C ? T) missense mutation in the signal peptide (SP) sequence (rs2472553) of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) ?2 subunit produces a threonine-to-isoleucine substitution (T22I) often associated with nicotine dependence (ND). We assessed effects on function of ?2*-nAChR ('*'indicates presence of additional subunits) of this mutation, which could alter SP cleavage, RNA/protein secondary structure, and/or efficiency of transcription, translation, subunit assembly, receptor trafficking or cell surface expression. Two-electrode voltage clamp analyses indicate peak current responses to ACh or nicotine are decreased 2.8-5.8-fold for putative low sensitivity (LS; 10:1 ratio of ?:? subunit cRNAs injected) ?2?2- or ?2?4-nAChR and increased for putative high sensitivity (HS; 1:10 ?:? subunit ratio) ?2?2- (5.7-15-fold) or ?2?4- (1.9-2.2-fold) nAChR as a result of the mutation. Agonist potencies are decreased 1.6-4-fold for putative LS or HS ?2(T22I)?2-nAChR or for either ?2*-nAChR subtype formed in the presence of equal amounts of subunit cRNA, slightly decreased for LS ?2(T22I)?4-nAChR, but increased 1.4-2.4-fold for HS ?2(T22I)?4-nAChR relative to receptors containing wild-type ?2 subunits. These effects suggest that the ?2 subunit SP mutation generally favors formation of LS receptor isoforms. We hypothesize that lower sensitivity of human ?2*-nAChR to nicotine could contribute to increased susceptibility to ND. To our knowledge this is the first report of a SP mutation having a functional effect in a member of cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels.
