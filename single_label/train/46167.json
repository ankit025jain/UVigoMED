{"id":46167,"title":"HER2 expression in primary gastric cancers and paired synchronous lymph node and liver metastases. A possible road to target HER2 with radionuclides.","abstract":"Resistance has been reported to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib and the antibody trastuzumab in metastatic gastric cancer. An alternative or complement might be to target the extracellular domain of HER2 with therapy-effective radionuclides. The fraction of patients with HER2 expression in primary tumors and major metastatic sites, e.g., lymph nodes and liver, was analyzed to evaluate the potential for such therapy. Samples from primary tumors and lymph node and liver metastases were taken from each patient within a few hours, and to our knowledge, such sampling is unique. The number of analyzed cases was therefore limited, since patients that had received preoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or HER2-targeted therapy were excluded. From a large number of considered patients, only 29 could be included for HER2 analysis. Intracellular mutations were not analyzed since they are assumed to have no or minor effect on the extracellular binding of molecules that deliver radionuclides. HER2 was positive in nearly 52 % of the primary tumors, and these expressed HER2 in corresponding lymph node and liver metastases in 93 and 100 % of the cases, respectively. Similar values for primary tumors and also good concordance with metastases have been indicated in the literature. Thus, relevant radionuclides and targeting molecules for nuclear medicine-based noninvasive, whole-body receptor analysis, dose planning, and therapy can be applied for many patients; see \"Discussion\" Hopefully, more patients can then be treated with curative instead of palliative intention.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Digestive System
