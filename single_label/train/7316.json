{"id":7316,"title":"Impact of the neutrophil response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on the risk of hemorrhage when used in combination with tissue plasminogen activator during the acute phase of experimental stroke.","abstract":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a pharmacologic agent inducing neutrophil mobilization and a new candidate for neuroprotection and neuroregeneration in stroke. Its effects when used in combination with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) were explored during the acute phase of ischemic stroke.We used a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of cerebral ischemia, associated with treatment with tPA, in male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; 60 ?g/kg) was injected just before tPA. Neutrophil response in peripheral blood and in the infarct area was quantified in parallel to the infarct volume. Protease matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) release from circulating neutrophils was analyzed by immunochemistry and zymography. Vascular reactivity and hemorrhagic volume in the infarct area was also assessed.Twenty four hours after ischemia and tPA, G-CSF administration induced a significant increase of neutrophils in peripheral blood (P <0.05). At 72 hours post-ischemia, G-CSF was significantly associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage in the infarct area (2.5 times more likely; P <0.05) and significant cerebral endothelium-dependent dysfunction. Ex vivo, an increased MMP-9 release from neutrophils after tPA administration correlated to the increased hemorrhagic risk (P <0.05). In parallel, G-CSF administration was associated with a decreased neutrophil infiltration in the infarct area (-50%; P <0.05), with a concomitant significant neuroprotective effect (infarct volume: -40%; P <0.05).We demonstrate that G-CSF potentiates the risk of hemorrhage in experimental stroke when used in combination with tPA by inducing neutrophilia. This effect is concomitant to an increased MMP-9 release from peripheral neutrophils induced by the tPA treatment. These results highlight the potential hemorrhagic risk of associating G-CSF to thrombolysis during the acute phase of stroke.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Animal
