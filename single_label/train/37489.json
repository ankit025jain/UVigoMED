{"id":37489,"title":"Impact of ostium secundum atrial septal defect closure on the resolution of falsely positive electrocardiographic criteria for myocardial scarring.","abstract":"Electrocardiographic (ECG) Selvester QRS score criteria with false indication of anteroseptal scarring consistent with myocardial infarction have been found in patients with ostium secundum atrial septal defect (OS-ASD). The objective of this study was to evaluate ECGs pre and post percutaneous transcatheter OS-ASD closure to test the hypothesis that the falsely positive criteria for anteroseptal scar decline 1 day post procedure.Patients (n = 34, mean age 48 Â± 17 years, 79% female) that underwent OS-ASD closure and had undergone pre procedure cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showing no left ventricular (LV) scarring were included in this study. ECGs pre and 1 day post procedure were assessed according to the QRS Selvester scoring system and compared.Mean Selvester score in anteroseptal regions pre procedure was 6.6 (0.0-6.8) % LV scar and decreased to 4.3 (0.0-6.0) % LV scar one day after the procedure (p = 0.01). Mean Selvester score in lateral regions pre procedure was 3.7 (0.0-3.0) %LV scar and decreased to 2.8 (0.0-0.0) % LV scar one day post procedure (p = 0.25).OS-ASD patients with falsely positive anteroseptal scar criteria by the Selvester QRS score pre procedure have a significant decrease in anteroseptal Selvester score 1 day post procedure. The falsely positive anteroseptal scar criteria did not completely resolve 1 day post procedure. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between ECG criteria for anteroseptal scar and right ventricular volume overload in late follow up.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491675","annotations":[{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Myocardial scarring","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_scarring"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.713322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.684737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.598396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.56214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.55602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Foramen secundum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foramen_secundum"},{"name":"QRS complex","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRS_complex"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Hypervolemia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervolemia"},{"name":"Primary interatrial foramen","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_interatrial_foramen"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
