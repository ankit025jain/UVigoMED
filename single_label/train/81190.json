{"id":81190,"title":"Oral rehabilitation of a 4-year-old child with early childhood caries under general anaesthesia: a case report on long-term outcome.","abstract":"Young patients with early childhood caries (ECC) commonly undergo oral rehabilitation under general anaesthesia (GA), often because of problems with behaviour management. Children with a history of ECC are highly susceptible to the development of new caries, even after comprehensive oral rehabilitation.The present paper reports the case of a female patient, aged 4.1 years, with ECC who was referred for treatment to the Department of Paediatric Dentistry of the Universitat Internacional de Catalunya. On account of the requirement for extensive dental treatment, and because of behaviour management problems, her dentition was restored under GA. A combination of restorative approaches and techniques was used, including the placement of composite resins, preformed metal crown restorations, extractions, and space maintainers. The patient was followed for 24 months, both clinically and radiographically.This case reflects the need to provide adequate support to children at high risk for ECC, together with their families by developing more acceptable and effective biological and behavioural interventions in order to reduce caries relapse after oral rehabilitation under GA.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Stomatognathic
