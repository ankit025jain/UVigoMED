{"id":34716,"title":"Challenges in genetic counseling because of intra-familial phenotypic variation of oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1.","abstract":"Oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1 (OFD1; MIM 311200) is characterized by multiple anomalies of the oral cavity, face and digits. We report a family with OFD1, where two female siblings and their mother shared the same mutation of the responsible gene (OFD1) c.1193_1196delAATC. Phenotypic variability was observed among them; the mother showed minimal features of OFD1, whereas her two daughters showed partial features and the full spectrum of OFD1, respectively. Thus, OFD1 was suspected only after a health check-up during pregnancy of the second patient showing fetal brain anomaly and maternal polycystic kidney. For these reasons, there was a delay in the recognition of OFD1 in this family. Patients with OFD1 show phenotypic variability, which poses challenges for genetic counseling.
