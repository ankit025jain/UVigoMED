{"id":84968,"title":"Regenerative cell and tissue-based therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension.","abstract":"Within the span of 2 decades, cell-based regenerative therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension have progressed from bench-side hypotheses to clinical realities. Promising preclinical investigations that examined the therapeutic potential of endothelial progenitor cell and mesenchymal stem cell populations have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of these cell types and provided the foundation for first-in-man clinical trials. Moreover, these studies have improved our understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms by which stem/progenitor cells exert their regenerative functions. Ultimately, these discoveries have led to new applications for stem and progenitor cells including the autologous cell reseeding of decellularized or synthetic lung scaffolds. In this review, an overview of established and emerging cell and tissue regenerative therapies for pulmonary lung diseases are presented, along with discussion of recent advancements in the emerging field of repopulating decellularized or bioengineered lung scaffolds with stem/progenitor cells for allogeneic transplant.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25442435","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.90909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Endothelial progenitor cell","weight":0.689186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelial_progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.564259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.381224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.380041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Biological engineering","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_engineering"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"List of distinct cell types in the adult human body","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Scaffolding","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"}]}
