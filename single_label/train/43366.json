{"id":43366,"title":"Laparoscopic management of obstructed gastric conduit afterÂ minimally invasive esophagectomy.","abstract":"We describe a novel, minimally invasive method of managing an obstructed gastric conduit after minimally invasive esophagectomy. In addition, we briefly review the management of obstructed gastric conduit in patients status-post minimally invasive esophagectomy. On literature review, it was noted that gastrojejunostomy after esophagectomy was exceptionally rare. Only one other reported case of gastrojejunostomy after esophagectomy was found in the literature. This is the first reported case to our knowledge of laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy after minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy after minimally invasive esophagectomy for obstructed gastric conduit is technically feasible, and it effectively managed the obstruction in our patient.
