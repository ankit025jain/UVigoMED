{"id":87467,"title":"Protecting trauma patients from duplicated computed tomography scans: the relevance of integrated care systems.","abstract":"Duplicated computed tomography (CT) scans in transferred trauma patients have been described in university-based trauma systems. This study compares CT utilization between a university-based nonintegrated system (NIS) and a vertically integrated regional healthcare system (IS).Trauma patients transferred to 2 Level I trauma centers were prospectively identified at the time of transfer. Imaging obtained before and subsequent to transfer and the reason for CT imaging at the Level I center were captured by real-time reporting.Four hundred eighty-one patients were reviewed (207 at NIS and 274 at IS). Ninety-nine patients (48%) at NIS and 45 (16%) at IS underwent duplicate scanning of at least one body region. Inadequate scan quality and incomplete imaging were the most common reason category reported at NIS (54%) and IS (78%).Fewer patients received duplicated scans within the vertically IS as compared with a traditional university-based referral system. Our findings suggest that the adoption of features of a vertically IS, particularly improved transferability of radiographic studies, may improve patient care in other system types.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25152252","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.702841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.550097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.524183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.314089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Medical radiography","weight":0.251096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_radiography"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Vertical integration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration"},{"name":"Israeli new shekel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_new_shekel"},{"name":"Ninetynine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninetynine"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"2channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2channel"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Gene duplication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplication"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Transferability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferability"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Information system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Integrated care","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_care"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"}]}
