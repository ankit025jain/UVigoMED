{"id":62042,"title":"Chimeric fusion karyotypes in childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","abstract":"Cytogenetics study using combination of conventional cytogenetics and fluorescent insitu hybridization was carried out in 171 pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients subgrouped to B-ALL (n=126) and T-ALL (n=45) by bone marrow morphology and immunophenotype. The chromosomal aberration frequency in B-ALL and T-ALL was 79% and 71%, respectively. TEL/AML1 translocation was detected in 28% of patients.
