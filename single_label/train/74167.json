{"id":74167,"title":"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor SNS-032 induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells via depletion of Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and displays antitumor activity in vivo.","abstract":"Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) have been reported to have activities in many types of cancer cells by inhibiting Cdk7 and Cdk9, which control transcription. SNS-032 is a potent and selective inhibitor of Cdk2, Cdk7 and Cdk9 and has emerged in clinical trials. Here, we examined the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells in the presence of SNS-032 and observed a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation in both cell lines. SNS-032 had a direct apoptosis-inducing effect through both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in breast cancer cells as shown by a dose-dependent increase in Annexin V-positive cells and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick?end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, as well as activation of caspase-8, -9 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). At the molecular level, SNS-032 induced a marked dephosphorylation of serine 2 and 5 of RNA polymerase (RNA Pol) II and blocked RNA synthesis. Consistent with the inherently rapid turnover rates of their transcripts and proteins, the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) were rapidly reduced on exposure to SNS-032. Our results also indicated that SNS-032 suppressed the growth of breast cancer xenografts in mice. These data demonstrate that the use of SNS-032 may be a rational and novel therapeutic strategy for human breast cancer and warrants further clinical investigation.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24865236","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclin-dependent kinase
