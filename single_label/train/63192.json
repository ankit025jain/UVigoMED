{"id":63192,"title":"Metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk among long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia - From the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort.","abstract":"Adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) have a four-fold excess risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease. This cardiovascular risk has not been fully characterized. ALL survivors [n = 784, median age 31·7 years (18·9-59·1)] in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study underwent evaluation for cardiovascular risk and metabolic syndrome (MetS) according to National Cholesterol Education Program - Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Comparisons were made to 777 age-, sex-, and race-matched controls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). MetS was identified in 259 survivors (33·6%) and associated with older age in 5-year increments (relative risk [RR] 1·13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1·06-1·19) and prior cranial radiotherapy (CRT) (with craniospinal radiation: RR 1·88, 95%CI 1·32-2·67; without: RR 1·67, 95%CI 1·26-2·23). Measures of obesity were highly prevalent among female survivors and CRT recipients. Compared to NHANES controls, ALL survivors had a higher risk of MetS (RR 1·43, 95%CI 1·22-1·69), hypertension (RR 2·43, 95%CI 2·06-2·86), low high-density lipoprotein (RR 1·40, 95%CI 1·23-1·59), obesity (RR 1·47, 95%CI 1·29-1·68) and insulin resistance (1·64, 95%CI 1·44-1·86). This large study of clinically evaluated ALL survivors identified a high prevalence of MetS, obesity and cardiovascular risk, particularly in CRT recipients, underscoring the need for screening and aggressive reduction of modifiable risks.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467690","annotations":[{"name":"National Cholesterol Education Program","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cholesterol_Education_Program"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.849269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.817416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.761812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.733987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.660836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.580655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.57819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.576468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.441977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.414446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","weight":0.377019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Nutrition_Examination_Survey"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.352145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Cathode ray tube","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"}]}
