{"id":27689,"title":"[Pharmacological tolerance to medical therapy of organophosphate poisoning and ways of tolerance management].","abstract":"Authors consider causes of low efficiency of antidote therapy and ways of pharmacological tolerance management during medical treatment of organophosphate poisoning. One of the promising ways is a preventive antidote on the base of enzyme agents and allosteric modulators of a cholinesterase activity. Authors showed a expediency of a study of new acetylcholinesterase reactivators, its compositions and ways of drug delivery. Authors specified ways of searching for anticonvulsants from classes of quick-closing benzodiatines and NMDA-antagonists. Authors defined ways of improvement of methods of special antidotes delivery with targeted transport system. Authors made an assumption about the necessity of symptomatic treatment.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286560","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Organophosphate","weight":0.731399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organophosphate"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antidote","weight":0.305572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidote"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.269221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Acetylcholinesterase","weight":0.260458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase"},{"name":"Symptomatic treatment","weight":0.235327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic_treatment"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Cholinesterase","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinesterase"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Allosteric regulation","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allosteric_regulation"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0438266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Transport network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_network"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Efficiency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency"},{"name":"Law of agency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency"}]}
