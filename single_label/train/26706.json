{"id":26706,"title":"Effect of balance training on walking speed and cardiac events in elderly patients with ischemic heart disease.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of standing balance training on walking speed (short-term outcome) and cardiac events (long-term outcome) in elderly ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients. This was a retrospective cohort study. Ninety-two elderly (? 65 years) IHD patients who underwent an inpatient cardiac rehabilitation program were assigned to two groups: a balance group that received standing balance training in addition to conventional (aerobic and resistance) training and a conventional group. Standing balance was assessed by one-leg standing time and a postural stability index reflecting dynamic balance, and normal walking speed was measured at baseline and hospital discharge. Patients were followed for up to 3 years or until a cardiac event occurred. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the groups. Both groups showed a significant change in normal walking speed from baseline to hospital discharge (P < 0.001, respectively), and normal walking speed was significantly higher in the balance group compared to the conventional group (P = 0.001). The postural stability index improved significantly only in the balance group (P = 0.005). Multivariable analyses using Cox proportional hazards model confirmed that standing balance training (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.408; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.162-1.029; P = 0.058) and fast walking speed (HR: 0.362; 95% CI: 0.137-0.957; P = 0.041) were associated with cardiac events. These findings show that standing balance training improves walking speed and reduces cardiac events, and suggests that such training can be an effective intervention for elderly IHD patients.
