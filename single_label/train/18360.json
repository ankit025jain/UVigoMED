{"id":18360,"title":"Comparative effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator versus defibrillator therapy alone: a cohort study.","abstract":"Trials comparing implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy with cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) are limited to selected patients treated at centers with extensive experience.To compare outcomes after CRT-D versus ICD therapy in contemporary practice.Retrospective cohort study using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry's ICD Registry linked with Medicare claims.780 U.S. hospitals implanting both CRT-D and ICD devices.7090 propensity-matched patients older than 65 years with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (&lt;0.35) and prolonged QRS duration on electrocardiography (?120 ms) having CRT-D or ICD implantation between 1 April 2006 and 31 December 2009.Risks for death, readmission, and device-related complications over 3 years.Compared with ICD therapy, CRT-D was associated with lower risks for mortality (cumulative incidence, 25.7% vs. 29.8%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.82 [99% CI, 0.73 to 0.93]), all-cause readmission (cumulative incidence, 68.6% vs. 72.8%; adjusted HR, 0.86 [CI, 0.81 to 0.93]), cardiovascular readmission (cumulative incidence, 45.0% vs. 52.4%; adjusted HR, 0.80 [CI, 0.73 to 0.88]), and heart failure readmission (cumulative incidence, 24.3% vs. 29.4%; adjusted HR, 0.78 [CI, 0.69 to 0.88]). It was also associated with greater risks for device-related infection (cumulative incidence, 1.9% vs. 1.0%; adjusted HR, 1.90 [CI, 1.07 to 3.37]). The lower risks for heart failure readmission associated with CRT-D compared with ICD therapy were most pronounced among patients with left bundle branch block or a QRS duration at least 150 ms and in women.Patients were not randomly assigned to treatment groups, and few patients could be propensity-matched. The findings may not extend to younger patients or those outside of fee-for-service Medicare.In older patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and prolonged QRS duration, CRT-D was associated with lower risks for death and readmission than ICD therapy alone.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798523","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Defibrillation","weight":0.747995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality","weight":0.719875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_for_Healthcare_Research_and_Quality"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.684279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.529115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.514275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.508726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.46125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.408118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.370618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.369287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.338221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Bundle branch block","weight":0.336425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_branch_block"},{"name":"Medicare (United States)","weight":0.255845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Left bundle branch block","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_bundle_branch_block"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Latin","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"},{"name":"Cardiac resynchronization therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_resynchronization_therapy"},{"name":"Bundle of His","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_of_His"},{"name":"QRS complex","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRS_complex"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
