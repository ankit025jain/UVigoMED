{"id":62159,"title":"[The \"Fragebogen zur sozialen Integration (FSI)\" - psychometric properties and acceptance in patients with hematological malignancies].","abstract":"The \"Fragebogen zur Sozialen Integration (FSI)\" is the German adaption of the \"Social Adjustment Scale (SAS-SR)\". So far, there is no validation of the FSI with regard to patients with cancer.The scales leisure time, relatives and partnership of the FSI were test-statistically analyzed in hemato-oncological patients. Concordant validity was examined referring to the German version of the \"Social Support Questionnaire (F-Sozu)\" and one scale of the \"EORTC QLQ-C30\".In N = 184 participants, we observed in 1% - 20% missing values for several items. Ceiling effects could be observed for the scales relatives (1.22-2.20), whereby for the scales leisure time (1.27-2.95) and partnership (1.51-3.91) the range was substantially higher. Internal consistency averaged about 0.75 (leisure time, partnership), respectively, 0.69 (relatives). Analyses for validity showed values of -0.23 to -0.50 (F-Sozu) as well as -0.29 to -0.40 (EORTC QLQ-C30), respectively.The FSI is a reliable questionnaire to assess social adjustment within hemato-oncological cancer patients. However, psychometric properties in previous studies with psychosomatic patients were better. The high amount of missing values on several items in our study suggests a partial revision of the this instrument would be advisable for use in oncology.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615234","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.466952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.412105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.329904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"German language","weight":0.263731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.204051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Psychosomatic medicine","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic_medicine"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Desegregation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desegregation"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"EORTC","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EORTC"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Leisure","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"272","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/272"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Ceiling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceiling"},{"name":"Gasoline direct injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_direct_injection"},{"name":"222","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/222"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Missing data","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Solidarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Popstars (Germany)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popstars_(Germany)"}]}
