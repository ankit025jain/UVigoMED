{"id":76760,"title":"Meta-analysis of all-cause mortality according to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D.","abstract":"We examined the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and all-cause mortality. We searched biomedical databases for articles that assessed 2 or more categories of 25(OH)D from January 1, 1966, to January 15, 2013. We identified 32 studies and pooled the data. The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality comparing the lowest (0-9 nanograms per milliliter [ng/mL]) to the highest (>?30 ng/mL) category of 25(OH)D was 1.9 (95% confidence interval?=?1.6, 2.2; P?<?.001). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than or equal to 30 ng/mL were associated with higher all-cause mortality than concentrations greater than 30 ng/mL (P?<?.01). Our findings agree with a National Academy of Sciences report, except the cutoff point for all-cause mortality reduction in this analysis was greater than 30 ng/mL rather than greater than 20 ng/mL.","date":"2014-07-12","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922127","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.651288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"United States National Academy of Sciences","weight":0.650793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.522929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.514478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.410752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.370553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.318384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.211533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.148859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"January 15","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_15"},{"name":"1966","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Metalworking","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalworking"}]}
