{"id":52169,"title":"Antiatherothrombotic effects of dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitors.","abstract":"Atherothrombotic cardiovascular events are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). A number of factors beyond hyperglycemia contribute to this increased risk of cardiovascular events in T2D, including elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and enhanced platelet activation. Importantly, most currently available antihyperglycemic treatments for T2D do not address these additional mechanisms. Indeed, we posit that this may explain why more intensive treatment of hyperglycemia has not contributed to a reduced incidence of cardiovascular events in subjects with T2D. Incretin-targeted therapies, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, are a relatively new class of antidiabetic treatments, and preclinical as well as small mechanistic clinical studies suggest that they exert beneficial cardiovascular effects. This review focuses specifically on the potential antiatherothrombotic effects of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors.
