{"id":21066,"title":"[Etiopathogenetic extracorporeal treatment of severe sepsis in patients after cardiac surgery].","abstract":"The study deals with assessment of LPS-adsorption and haemodialysis with EMiC2-filters use in the complex treatment in cardio-surgery patients with heavy sepsis. 64 adult patients included in the study were divided into two groups. 26 patients of the main group with heavy sepsis (EEA > 0.6; procalcitonin level higher than 2 ng/ml) received LPS-adsorption and haemodialysis with EMiC2-filters. 38 patients of control group with heavy sepsis developed after surgeries on heart and vessels did not receive extracorporeal methods of treatment. Positive effect of combined extracorporeal treatment on haemodynamics, oxygenation, endotoxin activity decreasing, procalcitonin level, inflammatory and antiphlogistic cytokines level was identified Trend of 28-day survival increasing was indentified in the main group.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624856","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.916137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Endotoxin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotoxin"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.815354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.795292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.758829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.369884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.321317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.133206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"European Economic Area","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"High-level programming language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language"},{"name":"Main group element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_group_element"}]}
