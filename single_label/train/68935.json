{"id":68935,"title":"[Bipolar versus monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate: a prospective randomized study].","abstract":"To compare bipolar with standard monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).A prospectively randomized study was conducted between January 2010 and September 2011. Primary end points studied were efficacy (maximum flow rate [Qmax], International Prostate Symptom Score) and safety (adverse events, decline in postoperative serum sodium [Na+] and haemoglobin [Hb] levels). Secondary end points were operation time and duration of irrigation, catheterization, and hospitalization.Sixty consecutive patients were randomized and completed the study, with 29 patients in the monopolar TURP group and 31 in the TURIS group. At baseline, the two groups were comparable in age, prostate volume, mean prostate-specific antigen value, International Prostate Symptom Score, and they had at least 12 months of follow-up. Declines in the mean postoperative serum Na+ for bipolar and monopolar TURP groups were 1.2 and 8.7 mmol/L, respectively. However, there was no statistical difference in the decline in postoperative Hb between the two groups. The mean catheterization time was 26.6 and 52 hours in the bipolar and standard groups, respectively. This difference was statistically significant as was the difference in the time to hospital discharge. The IPSS and Qmax improvements were comparable between the two groups at 12 months of follow-up.No clinically relevant differences in short-term efficacy are existed between the two techniques, but bipolar TURP is preferable due to a more favorable safety profile and shorter catheterization duration.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485082","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.876747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.792192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.664218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.65969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.587257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.505026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.412183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.363379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.339278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.304545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.141231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.079334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"High-voltage direct current","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Transurethral resection of the prostate","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transurethral_resection_of_the_prostate"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Maximum flow problem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
