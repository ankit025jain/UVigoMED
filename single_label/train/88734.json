{"id":88734,"title":"Ergonomic design of a computer mouse for clients with wrist splints.","abstract":"We explored effects of cutaneous feedback and hump position on efficiency and comfort in mouse use with a splint. We also analyzed the relationship between anthropometric measurements (width of hand and length of hand, palm, and index) and the task performance.Thirty participants performed a computer task with two forms of mice (front hump and rear hump) and two kinds of wrist splints (dorsal and volar). Movement time and satisfaction scores were recorded.No interaction effect (Hump Position Ã— Splint Type) was found on movement time. Movement time was shorter for rear-hump mouse users than for front-hump mouse users. Movement time was also shorter for wearers of dorsal wrist splints than for wearers of volar wrist splints. Limited differences existed in the satisfaction scores. Participants with a longer index finger had shorter movement time.Both dorsal wrist splints and rear-hump mice are recommended. Length of index finger positively correlated with task performance.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797195","annotations":[{"name":"Mouse (computing)","weight":0.578981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_(computing)"},{"name":"Ergonomics","weight":0.363115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.345686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.146439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.0504415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Length","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Arecaceae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecaceae"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Splint (programming tool)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splint_(programming_tool)"},{"name":"Interaction (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics)"},{"name":"Kyphosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyphosis"},{"name":"Hump (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hump_(comics)"},{"name":"Splint (medicine)","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splint_(medicine)"},{"name":"Index finger","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
