{"id":40984,"title":"Polyol pathway exacerbated ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury in steatotic liver.","abstract":"The polyol pathway, a bypass pathway of glucose metabolism initiated by aldose reductase (AR), has been shown to play an important role in mediating tissue ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) impairment recently. Here, we investigated how and why this pathway might affect the fatty liver following I/R.Two opposite models were created: mice with high-fat-diet-induced liver steatosis were treated with aldose reductase inhibition (ARI) and subsequent I/R; and AR-overexpressing L02 hepatocytes were sequentially subjected to steatosis and hypoxia/reoxygenation. We next investigated (a) the hepatic injuries, including liver function, histology, and hepatocytes apoptosis/necrosis; (b) the NAD(P)(H) contents, redox status, and mitochondrial function; and (c) the flux through the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway.AR-inhibition in vivo markedly attenuated the I/R-induced liver injuries, maintained the homeostasis of NAD(P)(H) contents and redox status, and suppressed the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway. Correspondingly, AR overexpression in vitro presented the opposite effects.The flux through the polyol pathway may render steatotic liver greater vulnerability to I/R. Interventions targeting this pathway might provide a novel adjunctive approach to protect fatty liver from ischemia.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24967007","annotations":[{"name":"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.836841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.747474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.689325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.66819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.663147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.628037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Aldose reductase","weight":0.585137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldose_reductase"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.385564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Polyol pathway","weight":0.287223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyol_pathway"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.270908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Polyol","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyol"},{"name":"Aldose","weight":0.184824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldose"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Flux","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
