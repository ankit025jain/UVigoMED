{"id":28226,"title":"Patterns of cortical activation following motor tasks and psychological-inducing movie cues in heroin users: an fMRI study.","abstract":"Drug abuse and addiction are worldwide health problems. However, few studies have used fMRI to investigate the effect of chronic heroin use on brain activation. This is a study along this line.fMRI positive sites in the brain were recorded during different motor and sensory activities.Following motor activities, heroin users had more sites globally activated in the brain than in normal volunteers, with ex-heroin users being least reactive. Conversely, a \"heroin puffing\" movie produced more activation in ongoing-heroin and ex-heroin users than in the normal individuals, whereas a movie with explicit sexual content was less stimulatory in both groups of heroin users compared to normal individuals.These significant findings relative to the function of specific brain nuclei are discussed.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24956915","annotations":[{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.783621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.744551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.726839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.686433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.611652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.546662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.494288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.4771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.43271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Pornography","weight":0.387138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.30687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Arousal","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arousal"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Nucleus (neuroanatomy)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_(neuroanatomy)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Cue (theatrical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_(theatrical)"},{"name":"Michael Ashburner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ashburner"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Motor system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_system"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
