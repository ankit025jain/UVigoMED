{"id":69026,"title":"Prognostic significance of serum albumin in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Systemic inflammation has been suggested to impact on the prognosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). We undertook a retrospective analysis of patients with mRCC treated at Akademiska University Hospital in Sweden during the years 2005-2012 to assess the possible prognostic significance of inflammation-related factors including serum albumin, platelet count, weight loss and C-reactive protein (CRP). The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) criteria for prognosis of mRCC and ECOG performance status were assessed for all patients. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional hazards regression was used for uni- and multivariate analyses. The median OS of all patients (n=84) was 20 months. Univariate analysis identified low serum albumin (HR=4.17, p<0.001), elevated platelet count (HR=2.98, p<0.001) and patient-reported weight loss prior to diagnosis of mRCC (HR=2.73, p<0.001), in addition to MSKCC (HR=3.35, p=0.0088) to be associated with shorter OS. CRP did not significantly affect OS. Serum albumin retained prognostic significance for OS in multivariate analysis (HR=2.72, p=0.015). In patients treated with an angiogenesis-targeted agent (n=47), low serum albumin level (HR=4.63, p<0.001) and elevated platelet count (HR=2.11, p=0.022) were associated with shorter PFS. In contrast, CRP, weight loss and MSKCC risk group did not significantly affect PFS. In multivariate analysis serum albumin remained associated with PFS (HR=3.92, p=0.0035). Our findings identify serum albumin as an independent prognostic factor for patients with mRCC treated with angiogenesis-targeted therapy.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477648","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.912617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.859481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.80736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.713197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.709619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.445403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.441888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.322559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Cooperative_Oncology_Group"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
