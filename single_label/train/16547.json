{"id":16547,"title":"Evidence that intraspecific trait variation among nasal bacteria shapes the distribution of Staphylococcus aureus.","abstract":"Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is a risk factor for infection, yet the bacterial determinants required for carriage are poorly defined. Interactions between S. aureus and other members of the bacterial flora may determine colonization and have been inferred in previous studies by using correlated species distributions. However, traits mediating species interactions are often polymorphic, suggesting that understanding how interactions structure communities requires a trait-based approach. We characterized S. aureus growth inhibition by the culturable bacterial aerobe consortia of 60 nasal microbiomes, and this revealed intraspecific variation in growth inhibition and that inhibitory isolates clustered within communities that were culture negative for S. aureus. Across microbiomes, the cumulative community-level growth inhibition was negatively associated with S. aureus incidence. To fully understand the ecological processes structuring microbiomes, it will be crucial to account for intraspecific variation in the traits that mediate species interactions.
