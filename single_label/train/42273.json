{"id":42273,"title":"Expression of group XIIA phospholipase A2 in human digestive organs.","abstract":"Cellular distribution of group XIIA phospholipase A2 (GXIIA PLA2) was studied in human digestive organs by immunohistochemistry. GXIIA PLA2 protein was detected in epithelial cells of normal gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder and pancreatic acinar cells. The GXIIA PLA2 protein was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm in contrast to secretory granular distribution of GIB PLA2 and GIIA PLA2 in pancreatic acinar cells and small intestinal Paneth cells respectively. Epithelial cells of intestinal glands in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis expressed abundant GXIIA PLA2 , whereas inflammatory cells were devoid of the enzyme protein. Tumour cells in colonic adenomas and carcinomas and pancreatic ductogenic carcinomas expressed GXIIA PLA2 protein at varying intensity levels. The putative functions of GXIIA PLA2 remain to be investigated and its role in healthy and diseased digestive organs can only be speculated on at present.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24862647","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.814388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Phospholipase A2","weight":0.75673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_A2"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.541762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Intestinal gland","weight":0.39789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_gland"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.299804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Paneth cell","weight":0.209824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paneth_cell"},{"name":"Acinus","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinus"},{"name":"Granule (cell biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_(cell_biology)"},{"name":"Centroacinar cell","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroacinar_cell"}]}
