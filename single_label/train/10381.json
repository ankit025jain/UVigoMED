{"id":10381,"title":"IVIg protects the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease from memory deficit and A? pathology.","abstract":"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is currently in clinical study for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, preclinical investigations are required to better understand AD-relevant outcomes of IVIg treatment and develop replacement therapies in case of unsustainable supply.We investigated the effects of IVIg in the 3xTg-AD mouse model, which reproduces both A? and tau pathologies. Mice were injected twice weekly with 1.5 g/kg IVIg for 1 or 3 months.IVIg induced a modest but significant improvement in memory in the novel object recognition test and attenuated anxiety-like behavior in 3xTg-AD mice. We observed a correction of immunologic defects present in 3xTg-AD mice (-22% CD4/CD8 blood ratio; -17% IL-5/IL-10 ratio in the cortex) and a modulation of CX3CR1+ cell population (-13% in the bone marrow). IVIg treatment led to limited effects on tau pathology but resulted in a 22% reduction of the soluble A?42/A?40 ratio and a 60% decrease in concentrations of 56 kDa A? oligomers (A?*56).The memory-enhancing effect of IVIg reported here suggests that A? oligomers, effector T cells and the fractalkine pathway are potential pharmacological targets of IVIg in AD.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655894","annotations":[{"name":"Intravenous
