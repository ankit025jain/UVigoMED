{"id":78651,"title":"Review of intellectual assessment measures for children who are deaf or hard of hearing.","abstract":"Intellectual assessment of children who are deaf or hard of hearing presents unique challenges to the clinician charged with attempting to obtain an accurate representation of the child's skills. Selection of appropriate intellectual assessment instruments requires a working knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of the measure and what changes in standardized administration might be necessary to accommodate for the needs of children who are deaf or hard of hearing. In the case of some available instruments, there is limited guidance and objective research available examining the performance of children who are deaf or hard of hearing. This review summarizes available information on widely used and most recent editions of intellectual assessment measures with special attention to guidance on accommodations, score interpretation, subtest selection and other test-specific considerations when assessing children who are deaf or hard of hearing.There is much opportunity for further inquiry in the field of intellectual assessment as it applies to children who are deaf or hard of hearing, as many measures have not been closely scrutinized for their appropriate use with this population. Clinicians must recognize inherent difficulties with intellectual assessment measures with children who are deaf or hard of hearing and issues in providing for an accessible and accurate administration of test items.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611926","annotations":[{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.840486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.509575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.40255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Intellectual","weight":0.36328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual"},{"name":"Inquiry","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.112102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0508123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Knowledge representation and reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"}]}
