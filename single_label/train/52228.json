{"id":52228,"title":"Decade-long trends in the characteristics, management and hospital outcomes of diabetic patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.","abstract":"Our objectives were to describe recent trends in the characteristics and in-hospital outcomes in diabetic as compared with non-diabetic patients hospitalized with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).We reviewed the medical records of 2537 persons with (n = 684) and without (n = 1853) a history of diabetes who were hospitalized for STEMI between 1997 and 2009 at 11 medical centres in Central Massachusetts.Diabetic patients were more likely to be older, female and to have a higher prevalence of previously diagnosed comorbidities. Diabetic patients were more likely to have developed important in-hospital complications and to have a longer hospital stay compared with non-diabetic patients. Between 1997 and 2009, there was a marked decline in hospital mortality in diabetic (20.0%-5.6%) and non-diabetic (18.6%-7.5%) patients.Despite reduced hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with STEMI, diabetic patients continue to experience significantly more adverse outcomes than non-diabetics.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618530","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.779914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.638938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.534199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.482455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Massachusetts","weight":0.450618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"History","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.0604724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"1853","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1853"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"684","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/684"},{"name":"Language shift","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_shift"},{"name":"Worcester, Massachusetts","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts"}]}
