{"id":42548,"title":"Multi-institutional analysis of recurrence and survival after hepatectomy for fibrolamellar carcinoma.","abstract":"Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) presents in young, otherwise-healthy individuals. This study examined recurrence and survival characteristics after surgical resection for FLC by utilizing an international multi-institutional database.Consecutive patients undergoing hepatectomy for FLC from six institutions (1993-2010) were reviewed retrospectively. Survival was studied with life tables and Cox regression models.Thirty-five patients (13 female, 37%) were included (median age: 32 years). R0 resection was achieved in all curative-intent operations (n = 30), and palliative operations were performed for five patients. Crude 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were 22% and 3%, respectively. For curative-intent surgery, overall and recurrence-free survivals at 5 years were 62% and 45%, respectively. In patients who achieved a 4-year disease-free interval after surgery, none subsequently developed recurrence. In multivariate models, presence of extrahepatic disease was the only factor that independently predicted overall (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38-22.55, P = 0.016) and recurrence-free survival (HR: 5.64, 95% CI: 1.48-21.49, P = 0.011).Patients with surgically amenable FLC had encouraging long-term survival. Recurrence-free survival to 4 years suggested possible freedom from disease thereafter. Recurrent resectable disease was associated with an excellent prognosis, and repeat surgery should be strongly considered.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844420","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.826303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.725719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.714458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Life table","weight":0.622723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_table"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.560932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.420945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.417882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.293455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.164981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Petroleum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum"},{"name":"1 metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_metre"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"R (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Amenable group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenable_group"},{"name":"Recurrent neural network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network"},{"name":"David Cox (statistician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cox_(statistician)"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Free will","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"GWR 2884 Class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GWR_2884_Class"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Statistical model","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model"}]}
