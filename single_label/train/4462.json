{"id":4462,"title":"John of God: an enigma for the medical sciences.","abstract":"Some cures carried out by Medium João Teixeira de Faría (John of God) are presented. He claims to channel spiritual entities (Drs. Augusto de Almeida, Oswaldo Cruz, and José Valdivino) that have instantaneous access to the physical, emotional and spiritual history of each patient who is then treated by physical or \"spiritual\" surgeries, herbs, meditation, prayers and the ingestion of \"energized\" water. People operated on have no pain during the interventions and infections have not been observed. The mechanisms responsible for the healings are unknown.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558757","annotations":[{"name":"God","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"},{"name":"Meditation","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Spirit","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit"},{"name":"Spirituality","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Prayer","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer"},{"name":"Healthcare science","weight":0.369179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_science"},{"name":"History","weight":0.355173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.337159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.278019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Faith healing","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_healing"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0388964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"People (magazine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Oswaldo Cruz","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswaldo_Cruz"},{"name":"Mediumship","weight":0.0236065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship"},{"name":"Pope John Paul II","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II"},{"name":"Paradox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox"},{"name":"Jos","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Teixeira","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teixeira"},{"name":"Gospel of John","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_John"}]}
