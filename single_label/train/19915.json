{"id":19915,"title":"Early impact of sequential introduction of 7-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on IPD in Israeli children <5 years: an active prospective nationwide surveillance.","abstract":"The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV7) was introduced to the Israeli national immunization plan (NIP) in July 2009 (administered at age 2, 4 and 12 months), with a fast reduction of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by PCV7 serotypes. Starting in November 2010, PCV13 gradually replaced PCV7.To report the impact of PCV7/PCV13 sequential introduction on IPD in Israeli children <5 years.An ongoing nationwide, prospective, population-based, active surveillance. All IPD episodes (Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid) from July 2004 through June 2013 were included.Overall, 2670 IPD episodes were recorded. Incidence of IPD caused by PCV7+6A serotypes during the PCV13 period vs. pre-PCV period decreased by 95% (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR]=0.05; 95% CI=0.03-0.09). This reduction was observed in a two-step manner: 90% in the PCV7-period and further 5% in the PCV13-period. The rates of IPD caused by the 5 additional PCV13-serotypes (1, 3, 5, 7F, 19A; 5VT) increased initially by 47%, but subsequently decreased by 79%, resulting in an overall 70% reduction during the entire study period (IRR=0.30; 0.21-0.44). A two-fold increase in non-PCV13 serotypes IPD was observed (IRR=2.43; 1.73-3.66). In total, a 63% reduction of all-serotype IPD episodes was observed in children <5 years (69% and 48% in children <2 and 2-4 years old, respectively).After initiation of PCV NIP, a rapid and substantial 2-step IPD reduction was observed in children <5 years. The serotype-specific rate reduction reflected the sequential introduction of PCV7/PCV13.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24690148","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.707234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.671518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.644814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.517543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.502215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.378001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.336947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.260458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.0750336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0401361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Hexadecimal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Videotape","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Valence (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"National Independence Party (Belize)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Independence_Party_(Belize)"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"British Columbia Highway 19A","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_Highway_19A"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 5","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_5"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"}]}
