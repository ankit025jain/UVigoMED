{"id":14453,"title":"[Comparative study on effects of blood enriching on mouse model of blood deficiency syndrome induced by compound method of bleeding, starved feeding and exhausting of Paeoniae Radix Alba and Paeoniae Radix Rubra, paeoniflorin and albiflorin].","abstract":"To study the effects of blood enriching on mouse model of blood deficiency syndrome of Paeoniae Radix Alba and Paeoniae Radix Rubra, paeoniflorin and albiflorin.Building the mouse model of blood deficiency syndrome induced by compound method of bleeding, starved feeding and exhausting of swimming, extract from Paeoniae Radix Alba and Paeoniae Radix Rubra were given during modeling. The amount of RBC, HGB were detected after the treatment. Based on the amount results of RBC, HGB and the paeoniflorin content, albiflorin content in Paeoniae Radix Alba and Paeoniae Radix Rubra, the same model and the same method were used to comparatively study the effect of blood enriching of paeoniflorin and albiflorin.At the 7th day, the amount of RBC and HGB in model mice was significantly increased (P <0. 01) by 2 g kg-1 Paeoniae Radix Alba and 2 g kg-1 Paeoniae Radix Rubra. At the 14th day, the amount of RBC and HGB in model mice was significantly increased (P <0. 01) by 2 g kg-1 Paeoniae Radix Alba. The amount of RBC and HGB in mice treated with Paeoniae Radix Rubra had an increasing trend compared with the same dose of Paeoniae Radix Rubra, but the difference was not significant. In another experiment with the same model, the amount of RBC and HGB in model mice was significantly increased (P<0.01) by 120 mg kg-1 paeoflorin and 120 mg kg-1 albiflorin at the 7th day, meanwhile, 60 mg kg-1 and 30 mg kg-1 albiflorin also increased the amount of RBC and HGB. At the 14th day, 120 mg kg-1 paeoflorin and all doses of albiflorin increased the amount of RBC and HGB. Comepared with that of the same dose of paeoniflorin, the amount of RBC in mice was significantly increased (P <0. 05) by 30 mg kg-1 albiflorin and 120 mg kg-1 albiflorin; the amount of HGB was significantly increased (P <0. 05) by 30 mg kg -1 albiflorin.Paeoniae Radix Alba has a better effect of blood enriching than Paeoniae Radix Rubra. Albiflorin is more effective in blood enriching than paeoniflorin. Combining these, it infers that albiflorin involves in the better blood enriching effect of Paeoniae Radix Alba.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24422408","annotations":[{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.395179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.127975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.0948015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Paeonia lactiflora","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paeonia_lactiflora"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Inference","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Starvation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Essential oil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil"},{"name":"Ulmus 'Rubra'","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulmus_'Rubra'"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Swimming (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"}]}
