{"id":81687,"title":"Oral health survey and oral health questionnaire for high school students in Tibet, China.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to identify the oral health status as well as oral health practices and access for care of graduating senior high school Tibetan students in Shannan prefecture of Tibet.Based on standards of the 3rd Chinese National Oral Epidemiological Survey and WHO Oral Health Surveys, 1907 graduating students from three senior high schools were examined for caries, periodontitis, dental fluorosis, and oral hygiene status. The questionnaire to the students addressed oral health practices and present access to oral medical services.Dental caries prevalence (39.96%) and mean DMFT (0.97) were high in Tibetan students. In community periodontal indexes, the detection rate of gingivitis and dental calculus were 59.50% and 62.64%, respectively. Oral hygiene index-simplified was 0.69, with 0.36 and 0.33 in debris index-simplified and calculus index-simplified, respectively. Community dental fluorosis index was 0.29, with 8.13% in prevalence rate. The questionnaire showed students had poor oral health practices and unawareness for their needs for oral health services. It was also noted that the local area provides inadequate oral medical services.Tibetan students had higher prevalence of dental diseases and lower awareness of oral health needs. The main reasons were geographical environment, dietary habit, students' attitude to oral health, and lack of oral health promotion and education. Oral health education and local dentists training should be strengthened to get effective prevention of dental diseases.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884668","annotations":[{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.773873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health promotion","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_promotion"},{"name":"China","weight":0.707107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.669549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.650518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.633539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Tibet","weight":0.596608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.518116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.463391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.451152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"School","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.139479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Dental fluorosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_fluorosis"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Calculus (dental)","weight":0.0182051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(dental)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0132532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"}]}
