{"id":88040,"title":"Penetrating foreign body in the nasal floor through nasolacrimal duct.","abstract":"Clinical otolaryngologists frequently encounter nasal foreign bodies (FBs) particularly among children. The removal of nasal FBs is a common otolaryngological practice. However, occasionally trauma results from FBs being lodged in the nasal cavity especially through the nasolacrimal duct. In this article we present an unusual case of a FB that from the left medial canthus went inside the nasolacrimal duct, then through the inferior turbinate and stuck in the floor of the nose. We describe the transnasal endoscopic approach used and we recommend that the treatment be done as soon as possible to avoid complications.
