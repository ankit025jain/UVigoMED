{"id":73294,"title":"Patterns, timing and risk factors of recurrence of gastric cancer after laparoscopic gastrectomy: reliable results following long-term follow-up.","abstract":"To clarify the patterns, timing and risk factors of recurrence of gastric cancer after laparoscopic gastrectomy.From January 1999 to March 2012, 577 patients underwent laparoscopic or laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy for curative resection of gastric cancer. Recurrence patterns were classified as locoregional, hematogenous, peritoneal, distant lymph node and mixed. Recurrence patterns and time to recurrence were retrospectively examined and risk factors for recurrence were analyzed.Recurrence occurred in 28 (4.9%) cases with patterns as follows: locoregional in 2 patients (7.1%), hematogenous in seven (25.0%), peritoneal in nine (32.1%), distant lymph node in four (14.3%), and mixed in 6 (21.4%). There was no recurrence pattern peculiar to laparoscopic surgery. Recurrence occurred at one site in 21 patients (78.6%), two in 4 patients (14.3%), and three in 2 patients (7.1%). The median time to recurrence was 384 days (range 83-1497 days). Recurrence was detected within a year in 13 cases (46.4%), within two years in 21 (75%), and within three years in 25 (89.3%). Univariate analysis revealed tumor location, tumor size, type of operation, tumor depth, and lymph node classification as risk factors for recurrence. Multivariate analysis indicated tumor depth and lymph node classification as risk factors of recurrence.Patterns, timing and risk factors of recurrence of gastric cancer after laparoscopic gastrectomy are similar to those after open gastrectomy, with no peculiarities specific to laparoscopic gastrectomy. Thus, as long as laparoscopic gastrectomy is performed according to the present inclusion criteria, follow-up can be similarly performed as for open gastrectomy.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24915857","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.698171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.618384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.565215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.383838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.283889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.19737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.192511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"577","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/577"},{"name":"384","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/384"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Peculiar galaxy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peculiar_galaxy"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"}]}
