{"id":90988,"title":"Surgical options for treatment of traumatic subdural hematomas in children younger than 2 years of age.","abstract":"Subdural hematoma (SDH) is the most common finding on cranial CT in pediatric victims of abusive head trauma (AHT). The hematomas are commonly bilateral and sometimes associated with interhemispheric hyperdensity and/or convexity hemorrhages. There is no consensus regarding the best surgical treatment in such cases nor are there standardized surgical protocols. The authors report their experience and discuss the routine surgical options in the management of traumatic SDH at a Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center.In this paper, the authors describe a cross-sectional study with consecutive revision of data described in the medical records of HÃ´pital Universitaire Necker-Enfants Malades between January 2008 and January 2013. During this period, all children younger than 2 years of age who were admitted with a traumatic SDH identified on CT scans were included in this study.One hundred eighty-four children who had SDH and were younger than 2 years of age were included. Their median age was 5.8 months (range 5 days-23 months), and 70% of the children were male. On admission CT scans, the SDH was bilateral in 52% of cases and homogeneously hypodense in 77%. Neurosurgical treatment was undertaken in 111 children (60%) with an admission Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 or less, bulging fontanels, or other signs suggestive of intracranial hypertension. The first surgical option was craniotomy in 1.8% (2) of these 111 cases, decompressive craniectomy in 1.8% (2), transcutaneous subdural puncture in 15% (17), external subdural drainage in 16% (18), subdural-subgaleal shunt placement in 17% (19), and subdural-peritoneal shunt placement in 48% (53). In 82% of the children initially treated with transcutaneous subdural puncture and in 50% of those treated with external subdural drainage, increase or persistence of the SDH, CSF or skin infection, or shunt system malfunction was observed and further surgical intervention was required. There was a 26% rate of complications in patients initially treated with a subdural-peritoneal shunt. Although 52% of the patients had bilateral SDH, bilateral drainage was only required in 9.4%.The choice of treatment should be determined by the clinical and radiological characteristics of the individual case. Although effective on an emergency basis, subdural puncture and external subdural drainage are frequently insufficient to obtain complete resolution of SDH, and temporary placement of a subdural-peritoneal shunt is needed in most cases.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Wounds and
