{"id":53254,"title":"Tamarind seed polysaccharide-gellan mucoadhesive beads for controlled release of metformin HCl.","abstract":"The paper describes the development, optimization and evaluation of tamarind seed polysaccharide (TSP)-blended gellan gum (GG) mucoadhesive beads containing metformin HCl through Ca(2+)-ion cross-linked ionic gelation for oral drug delivery. Effects of GG to TSP ratio and cross-linker (CaCl2) concentration on the drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE, %), and cumulative drug release after 10h (R10h, %) of TSP-GG mucoadhesive beads containing metformin HCl were optimized by 32 factorial design. The optimized mucoadhesive beads (F-O) showed DEE of 95.73 ± 4.02%, R10h of 61.22 ± 3.44% and mean diameter of 1.70 ± 0.24 mm.These beads were characterized by SEM and FTIR analyses. The in vitro drug release from these beads showed controlled-release (zero-order) pattern over a period of 10h.The optimized TSP-GG mucoadhesive beads also exhibited pH-dependent swelling, good mucoadhesivity with biological mucosal membrane and significant hypoglycemic effect in alloxan-induced diabetic rats over prolonged period after oral administration.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528714","annotations":[{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.814871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.780388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Hydrogen chloride","weight":0.511154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_chloride"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.501324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.361956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Ionic bond","weight":0.145517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_bond"},{"name":"Time release technology","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_release_technology"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Infrared spectroscopy","weight":0.0428226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Chewing gum","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_gum"},{"name":"Factorial","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial"},{"name":"Tamarind","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarind"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Bead","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
