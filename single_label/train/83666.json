{"id":83666,"title":"The effect of mild motion sickness and sopite syndrome on multitasking cognitive performance.","abstract":"In this study, we investigated the effects of mild motion sickness and sopite syndrome on multitasking cognitive performance.Despite knowledge on general motion sickness, little is known about the effect of motion sickness and sopite syndrome on multitasking cognitive performance. Specifically, there is a gap in existing knowledge in the gray area of mild motion sickness.Fifty-one healthy individuals performed a multitasking battery. Three independent groups of participants were exposed to two experimental sessions. Two groups received motion only in the first or the second session, whereas the control group did not receive motion. Measurements of motion sickness, sopite syndrome, alertness, and performance were collected during the experimentOnly during the second session, motion sickness and sopite syndrome had a significant negative association with cognitive performance. Significant performance differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants in the second session were identified in composite (9.43%), memory (31.7%), and arithmetic (14.7%) task scores. The results suggest that performance retention between sessions was not affected by mild motion sickness.Multitasking cognitive performance declined even when motion sickness and soporific symptoms were mild. The results also show an order effect. We postulate that the differential effect of session on the association between symptomatology and multitasking performance may be related to the attentional resources allocated to performing the multiple tasks. Results suggest an inverse relationship between motion sickness effects on performance and the cognitive effort focused on performing a task.Even mild motion sickness has potential implications for multitasking operational performance.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25277021","annotations":[{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.614233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.520555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.341406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Hypnotic","weight":0.212037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotic"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Axiom","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0703685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0471159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Arithmetic","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic"},{"name":"Alertness","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alertness"},{"name":"Motion sickness","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_sickness"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Computer multitasking","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking"},{"name":"Human multitasking","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_multitasking"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Inverse relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_relationship"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Differential equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Association (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(psychology)"},{"name":"Cognitive load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load"},{"name":"Implications of nanotechnology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implications_of_nanotechnology"}]}
