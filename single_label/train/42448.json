{"id":42448,"title":"The theoretical and practical knowledge of nurses and midwives regarding to the hepatitis-B virus (HBV) vaccination: a cross-sectional study in Konya--Turkey.","abstract":"The aim of our cross-sectional study was to investigate the factors that affected Hepatitis-B Vaccination (HBV) knowledge of the nurses and midwives, serving at various medical facilities as part of the primary healthcare services in Konya, Turkey. The study was conducted during March 01-31, 2004, including 127 consentient nurses and midwives (out of 161) serving at 22 different healthcare centers in the region. In the survey, their source of information with regards to HBV vaccination varied from continuing education programs (37%) to book or brochure reading (11.8%), and their formal nursing education (11%). A statistically significant relationship was found between the number of years employed in this profession and knowledge of Hepatitis markers that are done prior to the beginning of vaccination calendar (p = 0.01) (p < 0.05). Majority (74.8%) of the participants reported that they gave information to families about potential side effects of HBV vaccination. In conclusion we have suggested that a special training program should be given to nurses and midwives that included topics like Hepatitis markers, vaccine administration techniques, doses, proper record taking, briefing individuals and families.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851596","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.703857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.657429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Midwifery","weight":0.382574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwifery"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Continuing education","weight":0.340822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_education"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.268384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.171124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.16565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.147145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Book","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book"},{"name":"Nurse education","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_education"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"},{"name":"Calendar","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Primary health care","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_health_care"}]}
