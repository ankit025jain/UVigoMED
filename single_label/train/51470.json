{"id":51470,"title":"Bio-Inspired glucose control in diabetes based on an analogue implementation of a ?-cell model.","abstract":"This paper presents a bio-inspired method for in-vivo control of blood glucose based on a model of the pancreatic ?-cell. The proposed model is shown to be implementable using low-power analogue integrated circuits in CMOS, realizing a biologically faithful implementation which captures all the behaviours seen in physiology. This is then shown to be capable of glucose control using an in silico population of diabetic subjects achieving 93% of the time in tight glycemic target (i.e., [70, 140] mg/dl) . The proposed controller is then compared with a commonly used external physiological insulin delivery (ePID) controller for glucose control. Results confirm equivalent, or superior, performance in comparison with ePID. The system has been designed in a commercially available 0.35 ?m CMOS process and achieves an overall power consumption of 1.907 mW.
