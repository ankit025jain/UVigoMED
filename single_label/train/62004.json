{"id":62004,"title":"Diffusion-weighted imaging of skeletal muscle lymphoma.","abstract":"Muscle lymphoma (ML) is a relatively uncommon condition. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ML can manifest with a broad spectrum of radiological features. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the features of DW images of muscle lymphoma (ML).In our database, ten patients (six women and four men) with ML were identified who were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging including acquisition of DW images. DW images were obtained using a multi-shot SE-EPI pulse sequence. Apparent diffusion constant (ADC) maps were also calculated. Furthermore, fusion images were generated manually from DW and HASTE or T2W images.On T2W images, all recognized lesions were hyperintense in comparison to unaffected musculature and on T1W images they were homogeneously hypointense. All lesions demonstrated low signal intensity on ADC images. The calculated ADC values ranged from 0.60 to 0.90 mm(2)s(-1) (mean value 0.76 Â± 0.10; median value 0.78). On fusion images, all lesions showed high signal intensity.ML demonstrated low ADC values and high signal intensity on fusion images suggesting high cellularity of the lesions.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24638123","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.864089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.748311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.709475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.625588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.276731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.162852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Analog-to-digital converter","weight":0.136697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0642264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0509955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Fick's laws of diffusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fick's_laws_of_diffusion"},{"name":"ML (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Data acquisition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_acquisition"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Drum Workshop","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_Workshop"},{"name":"Homogeneity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_(physics)"},{"name":"Real estate pricing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_pricing"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Spin-lattice relaxation time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-lattice_relaxation_time"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
