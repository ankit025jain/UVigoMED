{"id":34821,"title":"Metabolomic prediction of fetal congenital heart defect in the first trimester.","abstract":"The objective of the study was to identify metabolomic markers in maternal first-trimester serum for the detection of fetal congenital heart defects (CHDs).Mass spectrometry (direct injection/liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry-based metabolomic analyses were performed between 11 weeks' and 13 weeks 6 days' gestation on maternal serum. A total of 27 CHD cases and 59 controls were compared. There were no known or suspected chromosomal or syndromic abnormalities indicated.A total of 174 metabolites were identified and quantified using the 2 analytical methods. There were 14 overlapping metabolites between platforms. We identified 123 metabolites that demonstrated significant differences on a univariate analysis in maternal first-trimester serum in CHD vs normal cases. There was a significant disturbance in acylcarnitine, sphingomyelin, and other metabolite levels in CHD pregnancies. Predictive algorithms were developed for CHD detection. High sensitivity (0.929; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.00) and specificity (0.932; 95% CI, 0.78-1.00) for CHD detection were achieved (area under the curve, 0.992; 95% CI, 0.973-1.0).In the first such report, we demonstrated the feasibility of the use of metabolomic developing biomarkers for the first-trimester prediction of CHD. Abnormal lipid metabolism appeared to be a significant feature of CHD pregnancies.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704061","annotations":[{"name":"Nuclear magnetic resonance","weight":0.884591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.766988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.75718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.735604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.491718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.469103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Tandem mass spectrometry","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.41895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.392698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.376701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.376491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.263435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.243667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.17571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.150554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Metabolomics","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolomics"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0867719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Sphingomyelin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphingomyelin"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
