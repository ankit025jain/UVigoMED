{"id":17159,"title":"Delivering three punches to knockout intracellular bacteria.","abstract":"Cytotoxic lymphocytes kill bacteria-infected cells, but the mechanisms at work remain unclear. Walch etÂ al. show that these lymphocytes deliver a toxic molecular trio in a two-step process, penetrating first the infected cells and then delivering bactericidal granzymes into the intracytoplasmic bacteria.
