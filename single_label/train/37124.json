{"id":37124,"title":"Effect of genetic subtypes and growth hormone treatment on bone mineral density in Prader-Willi syndrome.","abstract":"Abstract Background: Currently, there is limited information on the effects of growth hormone and of the different genetic subtypes on bone mineral density (BMD) in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).We evaluated BMD in 79 individuals with the common subtypes of PWS (48 with deletion and 27 with UPD) and the effect of growth hormone treatment (n=46) vs. no growth hormone treatment.Forty-four percent of the individuals studied had whole body, hip, or spine BMD <-1 standard deviation (SD) and 10% had a BMD <-2 SD. BMD Z-scores and total BMD (g/cm2) of the spine were significantly higher in the growth hormone group. With each year of growth hormone treatment, these values increased by a factor of 0.207 and 0.011 (p=0.006 and 0.032), respectively. Individuals with uniparental disomy revealed higher spine BMD compared with deletion subclass; however, the differences were not significant.This study emphasizes the importance of evaluating bone mineralization in individuals with PWS and the beneficial effects of prolonged treatment with growth hormone. There was a trend for a higher BMD in individuals with uniparental disomy.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24515997","annotations":[{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.817098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.748295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.646318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.642344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Uniparental disomy","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniparental_disomy"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.299873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.285693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.269901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.243736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.231059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Mineralization (biology)","weight":0.11443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralization_(biology)"},{"name":"Growth hormone treatment","weight":0.0739124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone_treatment"},{"name":"Aneuploidy","weight":0.0584998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"PWS (aircraft manufacturer)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWS_(aircraft_manufacturer)"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
