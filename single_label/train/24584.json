{"id":24584,"title":"[The evaluation of prognostic value of biomarkers in patients with chronic cardiac insufficiency].","abstract":"Nowadays, the laboratory markers of myocardial dysfunction (cerebral natriuretic peptide - NT-proBNP); instability of atherosclerotic plaque (highly sensitive C-reactive protein - hsCRP); damages of cardiac muscle (highly sensitive cardiac tropine I - hs-cTnl) play a key role in diagnostic, course prognostics and verification of risk of unfavorable outcomes in patients with chronic cardiac insufficiency. The article presents the results of study of dynamics of levels of NT-proBNP, hsCRP, hs-cTnl in 71 patients with chronic cardiac insufficiency of II and III functional class (according classification of New-York association of cardiologists - NYHA). The comparison was made concerning analyzed laboratory markers with fraction of output of left ventricle of heart and index of body mass relatively to their prognostic role inpatients with chronic cardiac insufficiency with different clinical conditions and various outcomes of disease. It is demonstrated that level of hs-cTnl is the most valuable in respect to unfavorable prognosis of course of chronic cardiac insufficiency and risk of lethal outcome. The level of NT-proBNP has invert correlation relationship with fraction of output of left ventricle of heart and can be considered as a laboratory indicator of functional condition of myocardium in patients with chronic cardiac insufficiency.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25346981","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.851987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.719142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.698365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.622433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.574442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.416282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.408367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.4067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Atheroma","weight":0.191667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheroma"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.163159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.142337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Predation","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Gross domestic product","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Prognostics","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognostics"}]}
