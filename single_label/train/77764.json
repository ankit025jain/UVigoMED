{"id":77764,"title":"[The development and application of MRI of the inner ear after gadolinium injections in the diagnosis of Meniere's disease].","abstract":"Due to the lack of objective examination method, the diagnosis of Meniere's disease mainly relies on subjective symptoms. MRI of the inner ear after gadolinium injections had become a new technology in otology in recent years. The image can clearly distinguish perilymph from endolymph in the labyrinth and can be applied to the imaging diagnosis, evaluation of treatment and the pathogenesis research of Meniere's disease. This article is a review of the development and the application in clinical research of this new technology.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25129984","annotations":[{"name":"Otology","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otology"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.746945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inner ear","weight":0.575281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_ear"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Gadolinium","weight":0.475442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadolinium"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.316544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
