{"id":29572,"title":"Tryptophan metabolism in post-withdrawal alcohol-dependent patients.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to investigate the parameters of tryptophan and phenylalanine metabolism and their associations to immune system activation and to behavioural symptoms during medium-term withdrawal (4-12 weeks of abstinence) in alcohol-dependent patients.Biochemical assays and clinical assessments at the beginning of treatment (fourth week of alcohol abstinence in average) and prior to the discharge after 8 weeks of treatment.Kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (Kyn/Trp) slightly correlated with neopterin levels in early post-withdrawal period (Week 4 of abstinence) but this association disappeared after 12 weeks of abstinence. Phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations as well as phenylalanine to tyrosine ratio (Phe/Tyr) decreased between Weeks 4 and 12 of abstinence. Kynurenine and Kyn/Trp increased significantly at 12th week of abstinence when compared with the beginning of the study (Week 4 of abstinence). At Week 12, Kyn/Trp significantly correlated with such behavioural symptoms as fatigue, irritability and sleep disturbances.Tryptophan breakdown in early stages may be influenced by the increased activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase but the increase of Kyn/Trp between Weeks 4 and 12 of abstinence seems to be independent of immune changes and correlates with behavioural symptoms in later stages of the post-withdrawal course. A possible role of kynurenine metabolites in mediation of the increased stress sensibility in post-withdrawal alcohol-dependent patients is discussed.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24644258","annotations":[{"name":"Tryptophan","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan"},{"name":"Phenylalanine","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Irritability","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritability"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.61033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.50936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.458761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.174834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Oxygenase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenase"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"}]}
