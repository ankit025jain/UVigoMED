{"id":52679,"title":"A ten year review of diabetic retinopathy at the Guinness Eye Centre, Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba, Lagos.","abstract":"Diabetic retinopathy is an important complication of diabetes mellitus, which may lead to blindness.The study is to analyze posterior segment lesions in Diabetes Mellitus patients seen in Guinness Eye Centre, Lagos University Teaching Hospital in relation to the number, duration and severity.All the case files of Diabetes Mellitus patients seen during the period of study were retrieved and data extracted from them were analyzed. Such information included age, sex, duration of Diabetic Retinopathy and its severity.A total of 84 case files were reviewed. There were 47 males and 37 females with a male to female ratio of 1.3:1. No diabetic patient was seen in the age group 30 years and below. Fifty-five (65%) patients who presented themselves did so very late. Of the 35 patients found to have diabetic retinopathy at presentation, 16 had the disease bilaterally. The most common form of Diabetic Retinopathy was clinically significant macula oedema. The study shows that a high proportion of the patients (41.6%) had Diabetic Retinopathy.Patients with DM should be referred early for eye examinations. Physicians Residents should be made to rotate through eye Departments for a period of at least 2 weeks so they can learn fundoscopy. Diabetic patients should be educated on the eye complications that may arise from their condition. Regular eye screening with fundus camera and laser therapy should be part of the routine management of Diabetics in Nigeria as is done in advanced countries.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Endocrine System
