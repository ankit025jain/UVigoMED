{"id":33429,"title":"New electrocardiographic features in Brugada syndrome.","abstract":"Brugada syndrome is a genetically determined familial disease with autosomal dominant transmission and variable penetrance, conferring a predisposition to sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias. The syndrome is characterized by a typical electrocardiographic pattern in the right precordial leads. This article will focus on the new electrocardiographic features recently agreed on by expert consensus helping to identify this infequent electrocardiographic pattern.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827804","annotations":[{"name":"Autosomal dominant","weight":0.831703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_dominant"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Penetrance","weight":0.796282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.779563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.521852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Brugada syndrome","weight":0.395556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugada_syndrome"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"}]}
