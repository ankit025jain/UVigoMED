{"id":34605,"title":"[Anterolateral diaphragmatic hernia: case report].","abstract":"Congenital anterolateral diaphragmatic hernia is rare, with few cases reported in the literature. This anomaly is usually associated with left pulmonary hypoplasia. Treatment is surgical and prognosis depends on the presence and severity of associated malformations. We report a case of an intraoperative discovery of this unusual type of diaphragmatic hernia in an infant.
