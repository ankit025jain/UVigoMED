{"id":1467,"title":"An analysis of adverse drug reactions to radiographic contrast media reported during a 3 year period in a tertiary care hospital in south India.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to analyse the nature and incidence of adverse drug reactions to radiographic contrast media (ionic and non ionic) reported during a 3 year period in a tertiary care hospital in South IndiaAdverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) to radiographic contrast media (ionic and non ionic) reported during a 3 year period to the pharmacovigilance centre, JIPMER, Pondicherry were retrospectively analysed for demographic profile, frequency, severity, causality and the temporal relationship of contrast administratior to the occurrence of ADR.A total of 99 ADRs were spontaneously reported from 63 patients. It included 38 (60.3%) males and 25 (39.7%) females. The most common ADRs were nausea 26 (26.5%), vomiting 33 (33.7%) and rashes 30 (30.6%). As per Naranjo's algorithm and WHO causality assessment, all reactions were 'probable' According to the Hartwig severity scale, 60 reactions were mild (60.6%), 34 (34.3%) were moderate and 5 (5.1%) were severe. There was no fatality reported. Adverse events required treatment in 38 (60.3%) patients Most of the reactions (n = 48, 76.2%) occurred immediately after contrast administration. Five (7.9%) reactions occurred during contrast administration and 10 (15.9%) reactions occurred within the next 30 minutes after contrast administration. Among the ADRs reported, the proportion of mild reactions were significantly higher in patients who received ionic contrast (n = 42) than those who received non-ionic contrast (n = 21) (p < 0.05).The common adverse reactions to contrast were nausea, vomiting and rashes. Most of the reactions occur immediately after administration of contrast and are of milder severity.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464676","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.809336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.746945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"India","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.682687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.535023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.437717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.432807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.38809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.325824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.27078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0787183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.0568689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Puducherry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puducherry"},{"name":"Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Institute_of_Postgraduate_Medical_Education_and_Research"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"}]}
