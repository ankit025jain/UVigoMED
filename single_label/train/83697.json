{"id":83697,"title":"[Oscillatory processes in microlymphatic bed of human skin].","abstract":"Laser Doppler flowmetry with wavelet-analysis of oscillations in microlymphocirculation was used for the first time at 30 persons with (n = 17) and without edema (n = 13) of the upper extremities distal parts. Human skin microlymphatic flow is characterized by well-defined predomination of pacemaker phasic oscillations in frequency range from 0.021 Hz to 0.042 Hz (palmar surface of finger distal phalange) or from 0.016 Hz to 0.035 Hz (forearm skin). Edema was accompanied by increase of average peak frequencies and normalized maximum amplitudes of phasic oscillations (A(l)/M(l), where A(l)--average maximum amplitude of phasic oscillations, M(l)--value of average lymphatic flow, both in perfusion units). Myogenic, endothelial and respiratory low amplitude oscillations were registered rarely. Heart rate rhythms were not revealed in lymphatic flow. Intercommunications were not found between values of A(l)/M(l) and skin temperature. Only in physiologic conditions without edema negative correlation was revealed between values of A(l)/M(l) and amplitudes of myogenic oscillations in blood flow; the latter reflect the number of open capillaries and the activity of oxidative metabolism. Intercommunications were not found between lymphatic and blood flow oscillations in edema availability. Normalized amplitudes and frequencies of phasic oscillations may serve as effective diagnostic indices in micro-lymphocirculation study.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272769","annotations":[{"name":"Artificial pacemaker","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.789907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.731783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.707468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.58524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.584953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.563779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.535353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.532697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Cellular respiration","weight":0.521095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.494502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.478021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.36034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.346708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.341381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.334192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.310982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human skin","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.261224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.256906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.249631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Myocyte","weight":0.13428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Sensory receptor","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_receptor"},{"name":"Phalanx bone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_bone"},{"name":"Ultrasonic flow meter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasonic_flow_meter"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
