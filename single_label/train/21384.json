{"id":21384,"title":"[Epidemiologic features of influenza in pregnant women and possibilities of vaccine prophylaxis].","abstract":"Analysis of influenza morbidity in pregnant women shows high frequency of severe variants of infection course with fatal outcome. The highest number of influenza complications accounts for women in the case of their infection in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, as well as having complicated pre-morbidity background in the form of bronchial asthma, obesity and diabetes mellitus. Healthy women at the 3rd trimester of pregnancy were shown to have the same risk of complicated course of respiratory infection as non-pregnant women with chronic concomitant pathology. Vaccination against influenza in pregnant women has a well demonstrated safety and effectiveness. Contemporary vaccines currently used allow with a high significance to decrease the risk of development of obstetric and pediatric pathology connected with previous influenza infection.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605667","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.832941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.784186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.701197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.605737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.393623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.330911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.210198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
