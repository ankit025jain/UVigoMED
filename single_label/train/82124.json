{"id":82124,"title":"Pediatric solitary intraosseous infantile myofibroma of the mandible.","abstract":"Myofibroma is a rare benign tumor of myofibroblastic origin that presents as solitary or multiple, and as an intraosseous and/or soft tissue lesion. It most commonly occurs in infants and children, although adult myofibromas have also been reported. Solitary central infantile myofibroma of the jaws is very rare and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of central jaw lesions involving the mandible in children. Its etiology is unknown. The purpose of this manuscript is to report a case of solitary intraosseous infantile myofibroma of the mandible wherein trauma may have been a contributory factor to the development of the tumor. The importance of immunohistochemistry in diagnosing this entity has also been emphasized. Resection should be preferred over enucleation when the lesion infiltrates the surrounding bone.
