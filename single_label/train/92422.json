{"id":92422,"title":"Cementless total knee replacement fixation: a contemporary durable solution--affirms.","abstract":"A retrospective review was performed of patients undergoing primary cementless total knee replacement (TKR) using porous tantalum performed by a group of surgical trainees. Clinical and radiological follow-up involved 79 females and 26 males encompassing 115 knees. The mean age was 66.9 years (36 to 85). Mean follow-up was 7 years (2 to 11). Tibial and patellar components were porous tantalum monoblock implants, and femoral components were posterior stabilised (PS) in design with cobalt-chromium fibre mesh. Radiological assessments were made for implant positioning, alignment, radiolucencies, lysis, and loosening. There was 95.7% survival of implants. There was no radiological evidence of loosening and no osteolysis found. No revisions were performed for aseptic loosening. Average tibial component alignment was 1.4° of varus (4°of valgus to 9° varus), and 6.2° (3° anterior to 15° posterior) of posterior slope. Mean femoral component alignment was 6.6° (1° to 11°) of valgus. Mean tibiofemoral alignment was 5.6° of valgus (7° varus to 16° valgus). Patellar tilt was a mean of 2.4° lateral (5° medial to 28° lateral). Patient satisfaction with improvement in pain was 91%. Cementless TKR incorporating porous tantalum yielded good clinical and radiological outcomes at a mean of follow-up of seven-years.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381416","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.717489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.49837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.412334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.388587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Osteolysis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolysis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.270887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"},{"name":"Valgus deformity","weight":0.201167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgus_deformity"},{"name":"Varus deformity","weight":0.159609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varus_deformity"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.133333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Porosity","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.0400049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Tantalum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantalum"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Slope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Team Knight Rider","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Knight_Rider"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Grappling position","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling_position"}]}
