{"id":68628,"title":"Association of IL-17F gene polymorphisms with renal transplantation outcome.","abstract":"Although interleukin 17 (IL-17) has some roles in renal transplantation, the influence of IL-17 gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on renal transplantation has not been studied.The associations of 5 IL-17F gene SNPs (-1507G/A, 6329G/A, 7384A/G, 7470G/A, and 7489A/G) with renal transplantation outcome were analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers (for -1507G/A and 6329G/A) and direct sequencing (for 7384A/G, 7470G/A, and 7489A/G) were performed on 282 renal transplantation recipients and 210 healthy controls.IL-17F SNPs were not associated with acute rejection. Recipients with G allele on 7489A/G showed lower graft survival than recipients without G allele (P = .04). In multivariate analysis, G allele on 7489A/G was an independent risk factor for graft failure (odds ratio = 2.77, P = .03).IL-17F gene SNP 7489A/G was associated with renal graft failure. Further studies are needed in larger number of patients.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507036","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.902927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.789135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.691835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.424734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.312183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"1507","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1507"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Aktiengesellschaft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiengesellschaft"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
