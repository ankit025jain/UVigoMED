{"id":36911,"title":"Position of premature termination codons determines susceptibility of hERG mutations to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in long QT syndrome.","abstract":"The degradation of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG, KCNH2) transcripts containing premature termination codon (PTC) mutations by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is an important mechanism of long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2). The mechanisms governing the recognition of PTC-containing hERG transcripts as NMD substrates have not been established. We used a minigene system to study two frameshift mutations, R1032Gfs 25 and D1037Rfs 82. R1032Gfs 25 introduces a PTC in exon 14, whereas D1037Rfs 82 causes a PTC in the last exon (exon 15). We showed that R1032Gfs 25, but not D1037Rfs 82, reduced the level of mutant mRNA compared to the wild-type minigene in an NMD-dependent manner. The deletion of intron 14 prevented degradation of R1032Gfs 25 mRNA indicating that a downstream intron is required for NMD. The recognition and elimination of PTC-containing transcripts by NMD required that the mutation be positioned >54-60 nt upstream of the 3'-most exon-exon junction. Finally, we used a full-length hERG splicing-competent construct to show that inhibition of downstream intron splicing by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides inhibited NMD and rescued the functional expression of a third LQT2 mutation, Y1078. The present study defines the positional requirements for the susceptibility of LQT2 mutations to NMD and posits that the majority of reported LQT2 nonsense and frameshift mutations are potential targets of NMD.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530480","annotations":[{"name":"Intron","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.901818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Stop codon","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_codon"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Sense (molecular biology)","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Translational frameshift","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_frameshift"},{"name":"Morpholino","weight":0.779665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpholino"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Oligonucleotide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligonucleotide"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.41087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Terminator (genetics)","weight":0.356237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.292779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.113728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Long QT syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_QT_syndrome"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Nonsense","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
