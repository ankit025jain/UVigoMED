{"id":38483,"title":"Two- and three-dimensional prenatal sonographic diagnosis of Alagille syndrome.","abstract":"We describe a case of Alagille syndrome diagnosed by second-trimester ultrasound. Features included the characteristic prominent chin, single umbilical artery, and hemivertebrae. Three-dimensional imaging demonstrated classic butterfly vertebrae, which were not otherwise appreciable. Alagille syndrome may be detected by second-trimester ultrasound in the at-risk fetus.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24420446","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.487328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.352588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Umbilical artery","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_artery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.250679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Chin","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chin"},{"name":"Butterfly","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly"},{"name":"Alagille syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alagille_syndrome"},{"name":"Congenital vertebral anomaly","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_vertebral_anomaly"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"}]}
