{"id":21073,"title":"Pulmonary involvement in patients presenting with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis: thinking beyond a normal chest x-ray.","abstract":"Recognition of pulmonary involvement in extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) may be an important public health issue, as smear-negative pulmonary TB is responsible for about 17% of new infections. Pulmonary TB can be present despite a normal chest x-ray (CXR), even in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients. In this retrospective clinical audit, we reviewed a case series of HIV-negative patients with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis to identify the proportion with concurrent pulmonary TB despite an unremarkable CXR.Clinical notes, microbiology results and CXR reports were reviewed from consecutive patients treated at Auckland City Hospital for extra-pulmonary TB from January 2007 to July 2010.Of the sample of 103 patients with extra-pulmonary TB, the majority of patients were born in an Asian country (n=70; 68%). The commonest presentation of extra-pulmonary TB was lymphadenopathy (n=51; 50%), followed by pleural (n=24; 23%) and bone (n=6; 6%) disease. Extra-pulmonary TB was diagnosed by biopsy or excision of the extra-pulmonary site in the majority (n=74; 72%), and by sputum testing alone in 26 (25%). The majority had CXR abnormalities (n=76; 74%). In the group with a normal CXR (n=27), 55% (n=15) had sputum cultures performed. In total, 18% (n=5) of patients with extra-pulmonary TB and a normal CXR had pulmonary TB, of whom two were smear positive.In patients with extra-pulmonary TB, sputum testing should be considered to detect concurrent pulmonary TB even if a CXR is normal, especially in immunosuppressed or symptomatic patients. This may aid diagnosis and determine infectivity and consequent public health action.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624413","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Chest radiograph","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_radiograph"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.583079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.497669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.46709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.422369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.330524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Auckland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland"},{"name":"Infectivity","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectivity"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
