{"id":85572,"title":"Fingolimod in a patient with heart failure on the background of pulmonary arterial hypertension and coronary artery disease.","abstract":"Fingolimod is the first oral immunomodulatory therapy approved for highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Based on the distribution pattern of fingolimod interacting sphingosine-1-phosphat receptors in organism including immune system and cardiovascular system clinical monitoring of patients and evaluation of adverse events are recommended. Despite extensive data on cardiovascular safety, experience with fingolimod in patients with concomitant cardiological disease, especially within the pulmonary circulation, is rare.We report the case of a 46-year-old woman presented with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and severe idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Fingolimod was initiated because of disease activity of multiple sclerosis with two relapses and gadolinium-enhancing lesions in MRI. The patient demonstrated stable disease course of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension when fingolimod was started. Fingolimod therapy did not alter or even worsen the pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions during first dose application as well as follow up of nine months.In this report, we present the first case of fingolimod treatment in a patient with highly active multiple sclerosis and severe idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. We suggest an interdisciplinary approach with detailed cardiopulmonary monitoring for safety in such patients.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906818","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary circulation","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_circulation"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.867542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Cardiovascular system","weight":0.82417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_system"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.766704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.741915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.721722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.625106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.590903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.588224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.182529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Fingolimod","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingolimod"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
