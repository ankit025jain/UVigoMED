{"id":52289,"title":"The impact of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on the expression of connective tissue growth factor and transforming growth factor-?1 in the myocardium of rats with diabetes.","abstract":"To define whether 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2 D3) can protect against myocardial fibrosis and to investigate its impact on the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1) in the myocardium of rats with diabetes.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into normal (control), 1,25-(OH)2 D3 therapy, and diabetes groups. In the diabetes and 1,25-(OH)2 D3 therapy groups, type 2 diabetes models were established using a high-fat, high-sugar diet and streptozotocin. Rats in the 1,25-(OH)2 D3 therapy group were also treated with 1,25-(OH)2 D3. After 6 weeks, the body weight, cardiac weight, cardiac weight index, plasma glucose, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) were measured; morphological changes in the myocardium were observed using microscopy following hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining. CTGF and TGF-?1 expressions in the myocardium were detected using immunohistochemistry staining and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.The body and cardiac weights of the rats in the diabetes and 1,25-(OH)2 D3 group were lower, but the cardiac weight index, plasma glucose, LDH and CK were higher compared with the control group (P<0.05). The body weight and plasma glucose, LDH and CK were decreased in 1,25-(OH)2 D3 group compared with the diabetes group (P<0.05). Pathological changes in the 1,25-(OH)2 D3 group were milder than the diabetes group. CTGF and TGF-?1 expression in the diabetes and 1,25-(OH)2 D3 groups were increased significantly, but in the 1,25-(OH)2 D3 group were significantly lower than diabetes group at the mRNA level.1,25-(OH)2 D3 had a partially protective effect on myocardial fibrosis of diabetic rats, which might inhibit CTGF and TGF-?1 expression in the myocardial tissues.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Endocrine System
