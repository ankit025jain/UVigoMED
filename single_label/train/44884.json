{"id":44884,"title":"Gallbladder cancer in Chile: Pathologic characteristics of survival and prognostic factors: analysis of 1,366 cases.","abstract":"To explore gallbladder cancer (GBC), the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women in Chile.Analysis of macroscopic and microscopic variables, morphometry, and survival in 1,366 patients with GBC.Patients comprised 1,138 women and 228 men; diagnoses included 213 (15.6%) cases of mucosal carcinoma, 132 (9.7%) cases of muscular carcinoma, 316 (23.1%) cases of subserosal carcinoma, 382 (28.0%) cases of serosal carcinoma, and 323 (23.6%) cases beyond the serosa. Women older than 55 years with a gallbladder length greater than 9.5 cm had a five-times-greater relative risk of cancer. Those with a gallbladder wall thickness less than 7 mm had a better 5-year survival rate than those with a gallbladder wall thickness greater than 10 mm (P = .0001). Patients who had cholesterolosis of the gallbladder had 9.2 times less probability of having cancer. The infiltration level of the gallbladder wall was the most important independent prognostic factor (P < .001), followed by differentiation and lymphatic involvement (P < .001 and P = .05, respectively). Vascular infiltration had a mortality rate of 100%.Morphologic features are strongly associated with the prognosis of GBC and must be taken into consideration when supplementary treatment is recommended.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713738","annotations":[{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.515046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.49236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.447581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Gallbladder cancer","weight":0.443992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder_cancer"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.436965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.411315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Serous membrane","weight":0.267779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_membrane"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.192081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Cholesterolosis of gallbladder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterolosis_of_gallbladder"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"228","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/228"},{"name":"Supplementary angles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_angles"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"Game Boy Color","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"}]}
