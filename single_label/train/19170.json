{"id":19170,"title":"[Real-time pcr procedure for determination of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes].","abstract":"Development and application of real-time PCR (RT-PCR) procedure for determination of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes.S. pneumoniae cps-locus wzx, wzy, wzz, wcwV and galU genes were chosen as PCR targets to select serotype-specific oligonucleotide primers and fluorescent labeled probes. 89 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained in 2007 - 2010 from patients with pneumococcal meningitis diagnosis undergoing therapy in the Infectious Clinical Hospital No. 2, Moscow, were studied with the aim of testing the possibility of practical use of RT-PCR.Primers and probes were selected for the determination of 16 vaccine and/or frequently encountered serotypes distributed among 4 reaction mixtures also including a pair of primers and a probe for cpsA gene detection that is present in all the capsule pneumococci (internal control). The procedure was tested on a collection of 108 pneumococci strains gathered in Research Institute of Antimicrobial Therapy and serotyped earlier by specific PCR with electrophoretic detection and serologically by using Pneumotest-Latex kit. The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR was 100%. RT-PCR procedure allowed to determine pneumococcus serotype in 79% of CSF clinical samples containing S. pneumoniae DNA. Serotype 3 and 23F were detected most frequently (13%, each).RT-PCR application does not assume causative agent seeding stage, significantly reduces analysis execution time and increases sensitivity of the study. The developed procedure will allow to begin addressing the important problem--clarification of spectra and frequency of occurrence of pneumococci serotypes circulating on the territory of Russia.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738293","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.887862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.663938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Oligonucleotide","weight":0.655662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligonucleotide"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.51033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.307034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.186417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Moscow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Sampling bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Bacterial capsule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"}]}
