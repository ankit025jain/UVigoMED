{"id":88143,"title":"Acute spontaneous atraumatic bilateral anterior dislocation of the shoulder joint with Hill-Sachs lesions: first reported case and review of literature.","abstract":"The anatomy of the shoulder joint comprises a relatively large humeral head with a shallow glenoid cavity allowing a remarkable range of motion at the expense of inherent instability. Despite anterior shoulder dislocations being the most common type encountered, bilateral dislocations are rare and almost always posterior. The aetiology is usually direct or indirect trauma related to sports, seizures, electric shock or electroconvulsive therapy. We present the first reported case of atraumatic bilateral acute anterior shoulder dislocations with associated Hill-Sachs lesions in a young, fit and well patient with no comorbidities. MRI illustrated the Hill-Sachs lesions with superior labral tear from anterior to posterior, and confirmed the acute nature of the injury by demonstrating the bone marrow oedema. The patient was treated surgically with arthroscopic anterior stabilisation. At 6?months following surgery, the patient has a pain free full range of movement of both shoulders with no further dislocations and has returned to work.
