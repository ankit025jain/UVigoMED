{"id":2973,"title":"An analysis of the feelings of pregnant women at risk of preterm labour.","abstract":"The aim of the study was an analysis of the feelings of pregnant women at risk ofpreterm labour.313 expectant mothers aged between 18 to 44 years (ranges: 18-25, 26-30 and 31-44 years) with no psychological disorders, hospitalized and treated due to the risk of preterm labour were surveyed. All the examined pregnant women expressed voluntary and informed consent for the participation in the survey. Each of the questionnaires given to the examined pregnant women contained: a questionnaire form devised by the authors, to establish the characteristics of the surveyed expectant mothers, and the following research standardized tool - Negative and Positive Feelings Scale by P. Brzozowski.The value of the mean level of positive feel- ings state in the group of patients aged 31-44 years with higher education was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the mean value in the group of patients aged 26-30 years with secondary or primary/vocational education. Marital status and place of residence had no effect on the level of positive feelings as a condition of pregnant women in the study group (p > 0.05). There were no significant statistical differences (p > 0.05) between the level of negative feel- ings trait and age. It was found, however, that the level of negative feelings trait was significantly lower (p = 0.0009) in pregnant women with higher education than in pregnant women who had completed secondary education.1. Among pregnant women at risk of pre- term labour, higher levels of positive feelings were found in pregnant women aged 31-44 years with higher education, being married and residents of a provincial city. 2. In order to reduce negative feelings in pregnant women at risk of preterm labour it seems important to implement appropriate psychological and prophylactic management, provide adequate care in the pregnancy pathology department, as well as support from the medical staff and the family. These activities should be targeted particularly at younger women with primary education or vocational training, not being married and living in rural areas.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518095","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Vocational education","weight":0.599344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.561506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.50652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.470446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.46552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.447716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.417861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.393623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.331001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.271872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Labour economics","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.147091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.139894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.122913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"City","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Provinces and territories of Canada","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Marital status","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_status"}]}
