{"id":80094,"title":"Sex: how malaria parasites get turned on.","abstract":"The mechanisms underlying sexual stage switching in Plasmodium spp. have hitherto remained a mystery. However, two recent studies have revealed that an apicomplexan-specific DNA-binding protein is essential for the initiation of this cell fate decision, ultimately providing the malaria community with a novel and important tool in the battle to prevent malaria transmission.
