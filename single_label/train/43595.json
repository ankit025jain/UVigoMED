{"id":43595,"title":"Cancer antigen-125 and ICAM-1 are together responsible for ascites in liver cirrhosis.","abstract":"Cancer antigen-125 is a high molecular weight glycoprotein used mainly for the diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma. However, elevation of cancer antigen-125 is observed in many benign conditions specially in liver cirrhosis but the reason behind the elevation remains unknown. Similarly intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) elevation is reported in liver cirrhosis but its role played in liver cirrhosis and ascites is unclear.A total of 76 patients were involved in the study diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, Budd-Chairi syndrome, and tuberculous peritonitis. The degree of ascites was graded according to standard criteria into mild, moderate and severe. Cancer antigen-125 levels and sICAM-1 levels of all the patients were measured along with other liver parameters to evaluate the association of CA-125 and sICAM-1 with ascites.When cancer antigen-125 levels of liver cirrhosis patients were correlated with ascites a strong correlation was observed with the degree of ascites but no association was seen with liver function parameters. A significant difference was shown when liver cirrhosis patients with ascites were compared with liver cirrhosis patients without ascites (p < 0.05). All the patients with ascites had elevated levels of CA-125 (mean: 261.11 U/mL +/- 118.15 U/mL) whereas most of the patients without ascites had CA-125 levels under the normal range. A strong correlation (p < 0.05) is seen between CA-125 level and the degree of ascites. Elevated levels of sICAM-1 were observed in liver cirrhosis patients with ascites as well as in patients with other benign diseases with ascites (mean sICAM-1: 7.23 +/- 4.12 ng/mL and 6.67 +/- 2.99 ng/mL, respectively). When sICAM levels of liver cirrhosis patients with and without ascites were compared a significant difference (p < 0.05) is observed.The elevation of cancer antigen-125 in liver cirrhosis is specific to ascites. The mesothelial cells of the peritoneum chiefly contribute to the elevation of cancer antigen-125 along with the large surface area of the peritoneum. Therefore, CA-125 can be used as a good marker for early diagnosis of ascites and CA-125 has no relationship with the etiology of diseases in benign ascites. ICAM-1 plays a key role in the formation of ascites by influencing the endothelial-vascular permeability and therefore it along with CA-125 can be used as markers or alternative tools to diagnose ascites and to monitor the progression and severity of the disease.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779300","annotations":[{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.914879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.850977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Peritonitis","weight":0.810769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritonitis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.806949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.783461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.78153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.7775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"CA-125","weight":0.633176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-125"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mesothelium","weight":0.464204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelium"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.460335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Molecular weight","weight":0.319422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_weight"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.146434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"ICAM-1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Surface area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Intercellular adhesion molecule","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercellular_adhesion_molecule"}]}
