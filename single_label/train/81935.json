{"id":81935,"title":"Neamine inhibits oral cancer progression by suppressing angiogenin-mediated angiogenesis and cancer cell proliferation.","abstract":"Angiogenin undergoes nuclear translocation and stimulates ribosomal RNA transcription in both endothelial and cancer cells. Consequently, angiogenin has a dual effect on cancer progression by inducing both angiogenesis and cancer cell proliferation. The aim of this study was to assess whether neamine, a blocker of nuclear translocation of angiogenin, possesses antitumor activity toward oral cancer.The antitumor effect of neamine on oral cancer cells was examined both in vitro and in vivo.Neamine inhibited the proliferation of HSC-2, but not that of SAS oral cancer cells in vitro. Treatment with neamine effectively inhibited growth of HSC-2 and SAS cell xenografts in athymic mice. Neamine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in tumor angiogenesis, accompanied by a decrease in angiogenin- and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cancer cells, especially of HSC-2 tumors.Neamine effectively inhibits oral cancer progression through inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Neamine also directly inhibits proliferation of certain types of oral cancer cells. Therefore, neamine has potential as a lead compound for oral cancer therapy.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778013","annotations":[{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.818326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.809257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.70374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Ribosome","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.58743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.560728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.559469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.55602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.485739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Protein targeting","weight":0.440925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_targeting"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.329701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Angiogenin","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenin"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Nude mouse","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.133549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Lead compound","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_compound"}]}
