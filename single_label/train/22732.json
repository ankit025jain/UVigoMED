{"id":22732,"title":"[Treatment failure in community-acquired pneumonia: coccidioidomycosis in a traveler patient].","abstract":"Treatment failure in community-acquired pneumonia is defined as a clinical condition with inadequate response to antimicrobial therapy. Resistant and unusual microorganisms and noninfectious causes are responsible for treatment failure. Coccidioides immitis is a fungus that causes pneumonia in the northern hemisphere, especially in the United States and northern Mexico. We report a case of pulmonary coccidioidomycosis imported from Mexico to Chile. After a comprehensive study, histopathology was able to establish Coccidiodes immitis as the causative agent, achieving clinical and radiological improvement with antifungal therapy.
