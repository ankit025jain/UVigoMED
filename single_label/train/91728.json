{"id":91728,"title":"An atraumatic turf toe in an elite soccer player--a stress related phenomenon?","abstract":"Plantar plate injuries to the hallux in elite athlete could potentially be career threatening. Reports in the literature are invariably linked to a significant traumatic episode. The occurrence of an atraumatic severe plantar plate injury in the presence of a bipartite sesamoid may suggest a stress related phenomenon. We present a case in an elite soccer player who was treated surgically and returned to top-level competition. The case is reported in detail and differences to other reports in the literature discussed.
