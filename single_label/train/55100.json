{"id":55100,"title":"The prevalence of refractive conditions in Puerto Rican adults attending an eye clinic system.","abstract":"To determine the prevalence of refractive conditions in the adult population that visited primary care optometry clinics in Puerto Rico.A retrospective cross-sectional study of patients examined at the Inter American University of Puerto Rico School of Optometry Eye Institute Clinics between 2004 and 2010. Subjects considered had best corrected visual acuity by standardized subjective refraction of 20/40 or better. The refractive errors were classified by the spherical equivalent (SE): sphere+Â½ cylinder. Myopia was classified as a SE>-0.50D, hyperopia as a SE>+0.50 D, and emmetropia as a SE between -0.50 and +0.50, both included. Astigmatism equal or higher than 0.25 D in minus cylinder form was used. Patients with documented history of cataract extraction (pseudophakia or aphakia), amblyopia, refractive surgery or other corneal/ocular surgery were excluded from the study.A total of 784 randomly selected subjects older than 40 years of age were selected. The estimated prevalence (95%, confidence interval) among all subjects was hyperopia 51.5% (48.0-55.0), emmetropia 33.8% (30.5-37.2), myopia 14.7% (12.1-17.2) and astigmatism 69.6% (68.8-73.3). Hyperopia was more common in females than males although the difference was not statistically significant. The mean spherical equivalent values was hyperopic until 70 y/o and decreased slightly as the population ages.Hyperopia is the most common refractive error and its prevalence and seems to increase among the aging population who visited the clinics. Further programs and studies must be developed to address the refractive errors needs of the adult Puerto Rican population.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000872","annotations":[{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.894492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Hyperopia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperopia"},{"name":"Amblyopia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.853728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.825294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Refractive surgery","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_surgery"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Optometry","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometry"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.762097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.73877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Aphakia","weight":0.73179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphakia"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.587088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.585583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.320135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.287499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Puerto Rico","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico"},{"name":"Emmetropia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmetropia"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
