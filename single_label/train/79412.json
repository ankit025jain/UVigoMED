{"id":79412,"title":"[Vestibular disorders in the minimal cerebral dysfun?tion in adults].","abstract":"Vestibular dysfunction is the most frequent symptom of minimal cerebral dysfunction in adults. Objective of the research was to study the etiopathogenesis of minimal cerebral dysfunction based on the analysis of the latency of different types of induced nystagmus. Threshold stimulation by physiological stimuli was used to study vestibular function (functional load tests) for the evaluation of neurodynamical plasticity of all parts of vestibular analyzer. Sixty males with manifestations of posterior cervical sympathetic syndrome, consequences of traumatic brain injury and neuroinfection, history of syncopes were examined. Spontaneous and different types of induced nystagmus were chosen as markers of vestibular dysfunction. Results of the study demonstrated that induced nystagmus had multineuronal arc, the latency of induced nystagmus was higher than that of spontaneous nystagmus and depended on the nature of stimulus applied to the vestibular system. In 3 patients, induced nystagmus was revealed in all tests with significant latency shortening compared to induced nystagmus in other patients. Functional load tests allowed to find a significant role of autonomic dysfunction, changes in the venous outflow and CSF flow in the cranial cavity and cervical proprioception in the etiopathogenesis of latent vestibular dysfunction in patients with minimal cerebral dysfunction.
