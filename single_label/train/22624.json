{"id":22624,"title":"New insights into the role of Plg-RKT in macrophage recruitment.","abstract":"Plasminogen (PLG) is the zymogen of plasmin, the major enzyme that degrades fibrin clots. In addition to its binding and activation on fibrin clots, PLG also specifically interacts with cell surfaces where it is more efficiently activated by PLG activators, compared with the reaction in solution. This results in association of the broad-spectrum proteolytic activity of plasmin with cell surfaces that functions to promote cell migration. Here, we review emerging data establishing a role for PLG, plasminogen receptors and the newly discovered plasminogen receptor, Plg-RKT, in macrophage recruitment in the inflammatory response, and we address mechanisms by which the interplay between PLG and its receptors regulates inflammation.
