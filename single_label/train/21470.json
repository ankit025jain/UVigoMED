{"id":21470,"title":"Kabrit ki gen twòp mèt: understanding gaps in WASH services in Haiti's IDP camps.","abstract":"Despite the enormous infusion of post-quake aid to Haiti, cholera had killed more than 8,000 people by January 2013. Based on two mixed-method studies of a random sample of 108 internally displaced person (IDP) camps and 168 interviews with agency representatives and recipients, this article examines the prevalence of factors that have proven most relevant to the rapid spread of cholera, particularly the provision of water and sanitation services in IDP camps. The study reveals that 30% of IDP camps had no toilets and 40% had no access to water before the outbreak, with only minimal progress after three months. Using bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses, this article explores patterns in the gaps of services with a range of variables such as NGO camp management, municipality and land-owners. It offers several theoretical and policy explanations for low level of services, concluding with a series of recommendations for better coordination and management.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601930","annotations":[{"name":"Cholera","weight":0.717865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.709788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Haiti","weight":0.550248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"},{"name":"Random sample","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.171154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.15322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Internally displaced person","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Displaced person","weight":0.0915594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displaced_person"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Water supply","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Toilet","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet"},{"name":"Municipality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Camp (style)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_(style)"},{"name":"Mitochondrial DNA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA"},{"name":"Orlando Renegades","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Renegades"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Government agency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Kibrit Air Base","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibrit_Air_Base"},{"name":"Sri Lankan IDP camps","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_IDP_camps"},{"name":"Minimalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Land tenure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_tenure"}]}
