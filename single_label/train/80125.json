{"id":80125,"title":"MalarImDB: an open-access literature-based malaria immunology database.","abstract":"The Malaria Immunology Database (MalarImDB, www.malarimdb.org) is a novel literature-based database of host mediators in blood-stage malaria. We designed this open-access online tool because intensive malaria research has resulted in a dazzling complexity of host mediators with pathogenic or protective functions. MalarImDB allows comparisons between expression levels in humans, expression levels in murine models, and functional data from experimental treatments in mice. The database is equipped with multiple search engines to retrieve information from many published studies. The search output is visualized schematically in tables, thereby revealing similarities and disparities. Thus, the primary aim of this database is to present a clear overview of the currently available data about malaria and to simplify literature searches.
