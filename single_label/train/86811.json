{"id":86811,"title":"S100A4 is an independent prognostic factor for patients with lung cancer: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"To evaluate the association of S100A4 levels with the prognosis of lung cancer (LC).The RevMan 5.0 software was utilized to perform literature retrieval, data collection, and statistical analysis according to its guidelines. Literature-based searching was guided to gather data, and the fixed-effect model was used to pool the hazard ratio (HR) in this study.A total of 10 eligible studies that included 1364 LC patients were analyzed. About 72.6% of patients had positive expression of S100A4 according to the criteria defined by the authors. The HR of positive expression for overall survival (OS) was 1.30 times of that of negative expression in LC patients (HR=1.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.61, p=0.02).Patients with positive expression of S100A4 appear to have a poorer OS compared with those with negative expression of S100A4.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742244","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.846368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.63907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.5415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.327143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.274202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.224581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.104609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Data collection","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"1364","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1364"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Negative (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_(photography)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Boston-area streetcar lines","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston-area_streetcar_lines"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Croatian Radiotelevision","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Radiotelevision"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
