{"id":87800,"title":"Trauma patient access: the role of the emergency medical services system in North-Central West Virginia.","abstract":"Trauma patients face many obstacles as they access the healthcare system in North-Central West Virginia. This study highlights some of these barriers and discusses administrative and legislative initiatives that could help mitigate the disparities that rural trauma patients face.This is a retrospective, observational study utilizing information from the West Virginia University (WVU) MedCom Database. Trauma related Emergency Medical Services (EMS) calls from 2002 to 2011 were reviewed to determine many of the parameters of the care provided by EMS in the WVU MedCom catchment area. These 54,952 trauma related EMS contacts were reviewed to determine estimated time of arrival (ETA) at the receiving facility, level of EMS response, trauma activation criteria, time of day, and day of week of the transport.The mean ETA for all transports was 11.7 minutes with mean transport ETA from the most rural county, Pendleton County, being 28.4 minutes. Emergency Medical Technician-B (BLS) providers covered 23% of the calls. Emergency Medical Technician-P (ALS) providers covered 76% of the calls. West Virginia State Trauma activation criteria were met for 30% of the transports. BLS providers transported 19% of these trauma activation criteria patients and ALS providers transported 78% of these transports.In north-central West Virginia, there are many barriers facing the trauma patient as they access the healthcare system. Among these are extended transport times, the capabilities of the EMS provider responding, and the limitation that approximately 50% of counties have either no hospital at all or only a hospital with limited treatment capability for the trauma patient transported by EMS.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24984404","annotations":[{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.530849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"West Virginia","weight":0.524595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia"},{"name":"West Virginia University","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_University"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.44099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.305582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.264936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.244882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.227723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.211662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Drainage basin","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin"},{"name":"Basic life support","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_life_support"},{"name":"Legislature","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Eta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta"},{"name":"Pendleton County, West Virginia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendleton_County,_West_Virginia"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ship transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_transport"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"952","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/952"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"West Virginia State University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_State_University"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Healthcare in Switzerland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Switzerland"},{"name":"Time of arrival","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_arrival"},{"name":"Estimated time of arrival","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_time_of_arrival"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Social inequality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality"},{"name":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"}]}
