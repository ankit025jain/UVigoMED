{"id":87555,"title":"The importance and the differences of bone morphogenetic proteins for osteoporotic hip fractures.","abstract":"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), major contributors to tissue repair, have become one of the most exciting fields in rheumatic and orthopaedic research. In our study we aimed to evaluate the relationship between osteoporotic hip fractures and the serum levels of BMPs to reveal their potential roles in the diagnosis of patients. The study group included 62 patients with osteoporotic hip fracture (Group 1; intertrochanteric fracture, Group 2; collum femoris fracture) and the control group. All fractures were due to low energy trauma, simple falls. For all subjects BMD measurements were in agreement for osteoporosis and no significant differences were observed between the two fracture groups. Biochemical markers; BMP-4 and BMP-7 (pg/mL) were determined by commercial Elisa kits from the serum samples. The mean and standard error values of serum samples for BMP-4 and BMP-7 in Group 1 (100.70 +/- 10.03, 74.41 +/- 6.31 respectively) and in Group 2 (112.34 +/- 11.52, 81.91 +/- 10.14 respectively) were not statistically different however for both groups only BMP-7 values increased statistically when compared to the control group. BMP-7 measurements may not only serve as potential biochemical markers for determining disease severity but also the increased levels, an osteogenic factor and bone stimulating agent in vivo, after trauma elevated levels are adaptive or protective and therefore may reduce the severity of the fracture.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090795","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.655952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.629751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Rheumatology","weight":0.617984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatology"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.594493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.492413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.465507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Tissue engineering","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_engineering"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.140579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein","weight":0.0945851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Biomarker (medicine)","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein 4","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein_4"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
