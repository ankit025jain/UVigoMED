{"id":2643,"title":"Video assisted thoracoscopic thyroidectomy for retrosternal goitre.","abstract":"Thyroidectomy for retrosternal goitre is usually carried out through a cervical incision. Around 4-12% of patients, however, require an extracervical approach, usually by sternotomy. Anatomically, the thyroid extends deep behind the great vessels in the pretracheal fascia. A sternotomy is therefore not only a substantial incision but this anterior approach is also not ideal for exposure. We report the use of video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) instead of a sternotomy or thoracotomy in conjunction with a transverse cervical incision for these patients.A retrospective descriptive study was carried out of seven patients with retrosternal goitre who underwent a VATS thyroidectomy.Twenty-one patients with retrosternal goitre were referred to our institution for surgical excision with the anticipation of requiring an extracervical incision. Of these, seven (median age: 68 years, range: 58-73 years) underwent a VATS thyroidectomy. The median operating time was 218 minutes (range: 120-240 minutes). The median diameter of the retrosternal goitre was 70 mm (range: 40-145 mm). Only one patient required conversion to a manubriotomy to deliver the bulky thyroid and one patient suffered a transient right recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. The median postoperative pain scores for days 0 and 1 were 1 (range: 0-5) and 0 (range: 0-3) respectively. The median length of stay was 5 days (range: 3-7 days).The use of VATS in thyroidectomy for retrosternal goitre offers a minimally invasive approach resulting in less morbidity while affording excellent exposure. </sec>","date":"2014-10-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25350184","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Recurrent laryngeal nerve","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_laryngeal_nerve"},{"name":"Thoracotomy","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.864015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.746848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.514089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.469884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Thoracoscopy","weight":0.376491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracoscopy"},{"name":"Goitre","weight":0.202778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goitre"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0881311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Laryngeal nerve","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_nerve"},{"name":"Pretracheal fascia","weight":0.0419679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretracheal_fascia"},{"name":"Transverse cervical artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_cervical_artery"},{"name":"Transverse plane","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_plane"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Median sternotomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_sternotomy"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Secretory pathway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretory_pathway"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"}]}
