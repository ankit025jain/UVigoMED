{"id":43420,"title":"Evidence of distinct populations of hepatitis C virus in the liver and plasma of patients co-infected with HIV and HCV.","abstract":"Viral diversity is an important predictor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment response and may influence viral pathogenesis. HIV influences HCV variability in the plasma; however, limited data on viral variability are available from distinct tissue/cell compartments in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Thus, this exploratory study evaluated diversity of the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of HCV in the plasma and liver for 14 patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Median intra-patient genetic distances and entropy values were similar in the plasma and liver compartments. Positive immune selection pressure was observed in the plasma for five individuals and in the liver for three individuals. Statistical evidence supporting viral compartmentalization was found in five individuals. Linear regression identified ALT (P?=?0.0104) and AST (P?=?0.0130) as predictors of viral compartmentalization. A total of 12 signature amino acids that distinguish liver from plasma E1/HVR1 were identified. One signature amino acid was shared by at least two individuals. These findings suggest that HCV compartmentalization is relatively common among patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. These data also imply that evaluating viral diversity, including drug resistance patterns, in the serum/plasma only may not adequately represent viruses replicating with in the liver and, thus, deserves careful consideration in future studies.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788693","annotations":[{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.826391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Entropy","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Scientific evidence","weight":0.696105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.671019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.621879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.618362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.49088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.410685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.362149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Evolutionary pressure","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_pressure"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.28711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.221013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.125541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Viral pathogenesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pathogenesis"},{"name":"Hypervariable region","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervariable_region"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"}]}
