{"id":45371,"title":"Laparoscopic surgery for stage IV colorectal cancer.","abstract":"Laparoscopic surgery (Lap) is a feasible therapy in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) without distant metastasis. Resection of primary lesion in stage IV CRC is now recognized as part of multimodal therapy. However, technical safety and invasiveness of Lap in stage IV CRC remain controversial. The feasibility of Lap in stage IV CRC was determined. Clinical outcomes were compared in primary colorectal resection using Lap, open surgery (Opn), and radical Lap for stages I to III CRC. No difference was observed regarding estimated blood loss and operative time between procedures. Postoperative recovery time and time to subsequent secondary therapy in the stage IV Lap group were significantly shorter than those in the Opn group. Similar results were observed for the 3-year overall survival rate. Lap for stage IV CRC is feasible and preferable in terms of technical safety and invasiveness. It may be useful in multimodal therapy for stage IV CRC.
