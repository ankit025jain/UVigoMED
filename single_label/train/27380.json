{"id":27380,"title":"A modified nomogram for ramp treadmill testing using the Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire.","abstract":"Studies performed over the past 2 decades have supported the recommendation that the exercise test protocol be individualized and that a targeted duration of 8 to 12Â minutes is optimal. However, this is not always implemented clinically because of the complication of having to choose a specific ramp to match a patient. We present a simple nomogram based on a questionnaire to choose 1 of 4 possible ramp protocols that provide individualized ramp rates for subjects undergoing clinical exercise testing.
