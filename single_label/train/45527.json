{"id":45527,"title":"Expanding indications for ESD: submucosal disease (SMT/carcinoid tumors).","abstract":"Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is useful for submucosal tumors (SMTs) within the superficial submucosal layer, but perforation frequently occurs during ESD for SMTs located at the deeper layer. Endoscopic resection for small esophageal SMTs is acceptable, although candidates for endoscopic removal are rare. Laparoscopic assistance will be effective for minimally invasive endoscopic local resection for certain types of gastric SMT. Endoscopic mucosal resection with a ligation device would be better than ESD for rectal carcinoid in terms of simplicity and effectiveness.
