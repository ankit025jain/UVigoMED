{"id":86170,"title":"Microvascular permeability changes might explain cardiac tamponade after alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","abstract":"Various sequelae of alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy have been reported. Of note, some cases of cardiac tamponade after alcohol septal ablation cannot be well explained. We describe the case of a 78-year-old woman with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy in whom cardiac tamponade developed one hour after alcohol septal ablation, probably unrelated to mechanical trauma. At that time, we noted a substantial difference in the red blood cell-to-white blood cell ratio between the pericardial effusion (1,957.4) and the peripheral blood (728.3). In addition to presenting the patient's case, we speculate that a possible mechanism for acute tamponade--alcohol-induced changes in microvascular permeability--is a reasonable explanation for cases of alcohol septal ablation that are complicated by otherwise-unexplainable massive pericardial effusions.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24808788","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac tamponade","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_tamponade"},{"name":"Pericardial effusion","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardial_effusion"},{"name":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy","weight":0.821334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.782266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.634145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.496062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.459367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.258593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.247594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.192811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.0649317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Alcohol septal ablation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_septal_ablation"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"}]}
