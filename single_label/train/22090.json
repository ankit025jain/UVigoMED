{"id":22090,"title":"Descending necrotizing mediastinitis and sternoclavicular joint osteomyelitis.","abstract":"Descending necrotizing mediastinitis is usually associated with cervical or odontogenic infections. We describe a patient with blunt trauma to the chest 2 years earlier, and a slowly developing chest wall hematoma 18 months prior to admission, complicated by chronic sternoclavicular joint osteomyelitis, eventually leading to descending mediastinitis. Thoracotomy with drainage of the mediastinal spaces and multiple procedures for the sternoclavicular joint infection were successful. The rarity of this association and undefined optimal management prompted this report.
