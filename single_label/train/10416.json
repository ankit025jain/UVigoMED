{"id":10416,"title":"Interference in the endplate nutritional pathway causes intervertebral disc degeneration in an immature porcine model.","abstract":"Previous studies have shown that blocking the endplate nutritional pathway with bone cement did not result in obvious intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) in mature animal models. However, there are very few comparable studies in immature animal models. As vertebroplasty currently is beginning to be applied in young, even biologically immature patients, it is important to investigate the effect of cement blocking at the endplate in an immature animal model.Two lumbar intervertebral discs in eight immature pigs were either blocked by cement in both endplate pathways or stabbed with a scalpel in the annulus fibrosus (AF) as a positive control, and with a third disc remaining intact as a normal control. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology study were performed.After three months, the cement-blocked discs exhibited severe IDD, with the percentage of disc-height index (DHI), nucleus pulposus (NP) area, and NP T2 value significantly lower than the normal control. These IDD changes were histologically confirmed. Post-contrast MRI showed diseased nutritional diffusion patterns in the cement-blocked discs. Moreover, the degenerative changes of the cement-blocked discs exceeded those of the injured AF positive controls.The endplate nutritional pathway was interfered with and diseased after three months of bone cement intervention in an immature porcine model. Severe interference in the endplate nutritional pathway in an immature porcine model caused IDD. These findings also draw attention to the fact that interference in endplate nutritional pathways in immature or young patients may affect the vitality of adjacent discs.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652423","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.692308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.605914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Degenerative disc disease","weight":0.4412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disc_disease"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.427039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Scalpel","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalpel"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.371952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Nucleus pulposus","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_pulposus"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.254027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.239959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.201462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.183436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.180731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Percutaneous vertebroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_vertebroplasty"},{"name":"Bone cement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_cement"},{"name":"Annulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_fibrosus_disci_intervertebralis"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.0193467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Piper_at_the_Gates_of_Dawn"},{"name":"Draw (chess)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draw_(chess)"},{"name":"Stabbing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabbing"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"International Direct Dialling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Direct_Dialling"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"NP (complexity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)"},{"name":"Vitalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"}]}
