{"id":67499,"title":"[Obstructive scleroobliteration as atreatment of varicocele].","abstract":"Authors developed and used the method of obstructive scleroobliteration with use of occlusive balloon catheter as a treatment for 32 patients. Advantages of this method: 1. Possibility of scleroobliteration in isolated area of the left internal testicular vein and its branches. 2 Improvement of sclerosant influence on venous wall by means of aspiration of blood and contrast agent of blocked vein. 3. Decrease of contrast agent by means of it aspiration after performed phlebography. 4. Prophylaxis of negative effect (allergy, thrombotic complications) of sclerosant by means of it partial aspiration and extravasal compression of proximal part of vein. 5. No late relapse. This method allow to perform an effective scleroobliteration with exclusion of testicular vein and venous collateral without special technical skills and cost increase. Aspiration of sclerosant in a lumen of vein allows to decrease the amount of surgical complications.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611297","annotations":[{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.806587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.765589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.715606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Balloon catheter","weight":0.714931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_catheter"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Venography","weight":0.641097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venography"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.602215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.366486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Varicocele","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicocele"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.202482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Testicular vein","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_vein"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sclerotherapy","weight":0.0953654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotherapy"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Plosive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Collateral (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)"},{"name":"Decrease (knitting)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decrease_(knitting)"}]}
