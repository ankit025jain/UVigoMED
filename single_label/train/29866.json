{"id":29866,"title":"The role of transporters in toxicity and disease.","abstract":"The significance of transporters in the disposition, metabolism, and elimination of drugs is well recognized. One gap in our knowledge is a comprehensive understanding of how drug transporters change functionality (their amount and activity) in response to disease and how disease and its inevitable pathology change transporter expression. In this issue of Drug Metabolism and Disposition a series of review and primary research articles are presented to highlight the importance of transporters in toxicity and disease. Because of the central role of the liver in drug metabolism, many of the articles in this theme issue focus on transporters in the liver and how pathology or alterations in physiology affects transporter expression. The contributing authors have also considered the role of transporters in drug interactions as well as drug-induced liver injury. Noninvasive approaches to assessing transporter function in vivo are also described. Several articles highlight important issues in oncology where toxicity must be balanced against efficacy. In total, this theme issue will provide a stepping-stone to future studies that will establish a more comprehensive understanding of transporters in disease.
