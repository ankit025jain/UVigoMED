{"id":82295,"title":"Practice-based, clinical trial of a silorane-based composite resin system in posterior teeth.","abstract":"Newer monomer systems have been introduced in an attempt to improve the success rate of direct composite restorations by minimising shrinkage.To evaluate the in vivo performance of a silorane-based resin composite system (Filtek Silorane, also known as P90), used together with a two-step self-etch bonding system (P90 System Adhesive, Self-Etch Primer and Bond), for the restoration of Class I and Class II cavities in human permanent posterior teeth.A total of 53 restorations were completed and patients were recalled one year later. The restorations were assessed by two ndependent clinicians, using the Modified U.S. Public Health Service evaluation criteria for the following parameters: retention, colour match, marginal discolouration, secondary caries, anatomic form, marginal adaptation, surface texture, occlusal and interproximal contacts.Of the 41 restorations assessed at the one year follow-up, 92.7% showed clinically acceptable scores for all the parameters evaluated. Cronbach's alpha values ranged from 0.72-1.00 showing a good inter-examiner agreement and reliability.Silorane-based composite, Filtek Silorane, when used in conjunction with the recommended adhesive system showed a clinically acceptable performance in posterior teeth restorations over a one year clinical service.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660403","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.830748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.598638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.532642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.50156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Monomer","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomer"},{"name":"Dental composite","weight":0.218581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_composite"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.183484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Bleach","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"United States Public Health Service","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Public_Health_Service"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"721","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/721"},{"name":"FN P90","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_P90"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Reliability engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Surface finish","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_finish"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Classes of United States Senators","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_of_United_States_Senators"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Mouthfeel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthfeel"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"}]}
