{"id":30646,"title":"[Analysis of adverse reactions and pharmacovigilance research to parenterally administered shuxuening].","abstract":"Parenterally administered Shuxuening is a commonly used Chinese medicine. There is a need to understand the characteristics of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to it. 9 601 ADR cases reports were collected from the national adverse drug reaction monitoring center reported between January, 2005 and December, 2012. These included 326 serious ADR cases, accounting for 3.93% of the total. It was found that ADR reports increased annually from 2005, reaching a peak in the third quarter of 2009. The number of ADR cases reports were greatest in the third quarter of each year. ADRs in patients aged 60-74, accounted for 3 348 (34.87%) of all cases. 9 391(97.81%) cases were administered by intravenous infusion. In 8 431 cases, the dosage was in accordance with instructions. 61.61% ADR cases occurred on first administration. The ten most frequent symptoms were, rashes, itching, dizziness, palpitations, chills, allergic reactions, shortness of breath, nausea, phlebitis and vomiting. Systemic damage mainly affected the skin and its accessories damage, or the nervous system damage. Through the use of proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) and propensity score applying generalized boosted models (GBM) to control for 17 confounding factors, analysis of the 10 kinds of ADRs found that for the ADR signals of dizziness, palpitations, phlebitis, and vomiting, BCPNN found that dizziness and phlebitis were early warning signals. This research found that in the 60-89 age group, higher dosages of parenterally administered Shuxuening gave rise to more phlebitis. This study provides important information for parenterally administered Shuxuening research, and guidance for its risk management.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471322","annotations":[{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.649292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.624073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.608877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Palpitation","weight":0.386555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpitation"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.342095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.263164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.259066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"China","weight":0.214197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Chills","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chills"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Phlebitis","weight":0.0467462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlebitis"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"}]}
