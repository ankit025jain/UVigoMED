{"id":52098,"title":"Equol producers can have low leptin levels among prediabetic and diabetic females.","abstract":"Soy isoflavones have received great attention for their beneficial effects on health and disease, i.e., in patients with diabetes. Equol is a biologically active isoflavone-related metabolite with interindividual differences in its production. The current study investigated the relationship between an equol-producing state and the levels of adipocytokine markers in a prediabetic and diabetic population.A total of 79 subjects (34 males/45 females) in a prediabetic or diabetic state recruited from the general population were examined regarding their ability to produce equol using urine samples. Clinical data, such as age, smoking as well as anthropometric and biochemical variables, including body mass index (BMI), lipids, insulin, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, leptin and adiponectin, were recorded.Equol producers exhibited lower leptin and leptin/BMI than non-producers among females. Simple correlation tests and stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed a significant inverse correlation between the leptin/BMI and equol-production. This relationship was not found in males.Female equol producers can have favorable metabolic traits in relation to leptin metabolism in this population. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629207","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.809346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Soybean","weight":0.556783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.548425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.20609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Adipokine","weight":0.123079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipokine"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Isoflavones","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoflavones"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0107573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
