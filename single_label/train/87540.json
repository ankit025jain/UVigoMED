{"id":87540,"title":"Schatzker type IV medial tibial plateau fractures: a computed tomography-based morphological subclassification.","abstract":"Schatzker type IV medial tibial plateau fractures have an unfavorable prognosis, likely due to the mechanism of injury (fracture-dislocation/subluxation type) and possibly due to the involvement of the posterolateral plateau, which is different from previously thought. The aim of this study was to propose a new subclassification of Schatzker type IV fracture patterns based on 2-dimensional (2-D) computed tomography and three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction. The authors defined Schatzker type IV medial tibial plateau fractures as AO/OTA 41 type B fractures (partial articular), with partial or total medial plateau involvement, leaving at least the anterolateral quadrant intact. The images of 42 fractures (42 patients) were evaluated. The fractures were further anatomically divided into 2 groups: Group 1 were classic medial unicondylar fractures and Group 2 were more complicated variants involving both condyles, characterized by medial condyle fractures with lateral plateau extension, usually with articular impaction of the centroposterior lateral plateau. Twelve (29%) cases involved only the medial condyle, and 30 (71%) involved both the medial and lateral condyles. Twenty-nine (69%) cases demonstrated posterior coronal fractures. The most common patterns were bicondylar posteromedial plateau fractures with posterolateral quadrant depression (bicondylar posterior fractures: 14 cases, 33%) and total/subtotal medial condyle fractures with posterolateral quadrant depression (13 cases, 31%). The isolated unicondylar posteromedial split fracture was uncommon (2 cases, 5%). Computed tomography-based reconstruction enhances the understanding of fracture anatomy and the relationships between fracture fragments. In Schatzker type IV medial tibial plateau fractures, the involvement of posterolateral quadrants is common.
