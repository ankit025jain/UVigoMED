{"id":73180,"title":"Structurally diverse MDM2-p53 antagonists act as modulators of MDR-1 function in neuroblastoma.","abstract":"A frequent mechanism of acquired multidrug resistance in human cancers is overexpression of ATP-binding cassette transporters such as the Multi-Drug Resistance Protein 1 (MDR-1). Nutlin-3, an MDM2-p53 antagonist, has previously been reported to be a competitive MDR-1 inhibitor.This study assessed whether the structurally diverse MDM2-p53 antagonists, MI-63, NDD0005, and RG7388 are also able to modulate MDR-1 function, particularly in p53 mutant neuroblastoma cells, using XTT-based cell viability assays, western blotting, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.Verapamil and the MDM2-p53 antagonists potentiated vincristine-mediated growth inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner when used in combination with high MDR-1-expressing p53 mutant neuroblastoma cell lines at concentrations that did not affect the viability of cells when given alone. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses showed that verapamil, Nutlin-3, MI-63 and NDD0005, but not RG7388, led to increased intracellular levels of vincristine in high MDR-1-expressing cell lines.These results show that in addition to Nutlin-3, other structurally unrelated MDM2-p53 antagonists can also act as MDR-1 inhibitors and reverse MDR-1-mediated multidrug resistance in neuroblastoma cell lines in a p53-independent manner. These findings are important for future clinical trial design with MDM2-p53 antagonists when used in combination with agents that are MDR-1 substrates.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24921920","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.810987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Verapamil","weight":0.755011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verapamil"},{"name":"P-glycoprotein","weight":0.75467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-glycoprotein"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.734147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.709001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.628037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.490148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.269621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.125424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Mdm2","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mdm2"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"}]}
