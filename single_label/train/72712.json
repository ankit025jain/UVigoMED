{"id":72712,"title":"Low-cost quasi-real-time elastography using B-mode ultrasound images.","abstract":"A low cost, quasi real-time elastography system, displacement-gradient elastography (DGE), was developed by applying digital image correlation (DIC) method and smoothing algorithm to B-mode ultrasound images. In order to achieve quasi real-time elastogram display, a new fast pattern matching algorithm, decoupled cross-correlation (DCC), was proposed and validated. By applying the DGE to various phantoms, elastograms were generated to identify the lesion with wide variations of stiffness ratio and applied strain. The performance of DGE was qualitatively compared with those from a high-end ultrasound scanner using the elastograms of a commercial elastography breast phantom. DGE was also applied to the ultrasound images of human breast lesions in various BI-RADS categories. This study suggests that DGE may have comparable performance to conventional elastography in detecting breast cancer, while it can be easily implemented onto conventional ultrasound scanners.
