{"id":55645,"title":"Idiopathic giant retinal cyst.","abstract":"The authors describe a case report of idiopathic asymptomatic giant retinal cyst with underlying hyperpigmentation. Low- and high-frequency ultrasound (ultrasound biomicroscopy) revealed an anechoic giant cyst with two hyper-reflective traction bands between the ciliary body and the anterior base of the retinal cyst. There was no retinal detachment.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24840531","annotations":[{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.702154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.550484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.417125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.363837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Cilium","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Hyperpigmentation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpigmentation"},{"name":"Ciliary body","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliary_body"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Anechoic chamber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anechoic_chamber"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
