{"id":68108,"title":"[Results of gamma-knife radiosurgery treatment for intracranial metastases of renal-cell cancer and prognostic factors influencing on the survival (joint study of three Eastern European Centers)].","abstract":"Gamma-Knife radiosurgery treatment for intracranial metastases of renal-cell cancer results are presented. Treatments were made in 3 Eastern European Centers: in Prague, Moscow and St. Petersburg from 2000 to 2011. 312 patients were treated. Median survival was 8 months (1-91 months). Follow up data were collected for 210 patients. Neurologic state worsening had place at 12% patients, but only 4% of deterioration cases are connected to GKRS. Causes of the rest cases are related to new metastases. Neurologic improvement was found at 29% of patients. Post-RS MRI data were available for 188 patients. Volume enlargement was observed at 10% of cases, but only 5% caused by continued growth. New metastases appeared at 53% of patients. Actuarial analysis didn't detect statistically significant differences in survival for such parameters as patient age, volume and number of metastases. Favorable prognostic factors (p < 0.05) were found to be Karnofsky state equal or more than 70, controlled primary tumor and absence of extracranial metastases, as well as marginal dose for largest metastasis more than 20 Gy. Now RS is one of the basic method of the discussed pathology treatment, that demonstrates high efficacy in relation to the tumor growth and the patient Quality of Life. It is noteworthy that the length of survival is determined by the depth of the complex treatment of primary disease and success of such treatment.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558749","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.814156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.762126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.72,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.602943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.458411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Moscow","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"},{"name":"Prague","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.379063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.322557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Saint Petersburg","weight":0.267177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.219048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.206606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.203268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Radiosurgery","weight":0.164423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosurgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.104609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0875503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Actuarial science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Enlargement of the European Union","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"United States presidential election, 2000","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}]}
