{"id":56375,"title":"Performance of the Spot vision screener for the detection of amblyopia risk factors in children.","abstract":"To compare the accuracy of the Spot photoscreener (Pediavision Holdings LLC Lake Mary, FL) in detecting amblyopia risk factors in children to the 2003 and 2013 referral criteria of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus (AAPOS).The medical records of children 1-6 years of age who underwent vision screening at a single clinic from February 2012 through May 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Participants were screened with the Spot photoscreener on the same day as a pediatric ophthalmology examination. Visual acuity examination, ocular alignment testing, and cycloplegic refraction were performed that day or within the preceding 6 months for all included subjects by one pediatric ophthalmologist. Sensitivity and specificity of the Spot photoscreening results were compared to the 2003 and to the recently revised 2013 AAPOS referral criteria.A total of 151 children were included. The Spot had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 74%. With the revised 2013 AAPOS referral criteria, the sensitivity was 87% and specificity was 74%.The Spot is a fully portable, automated tool for the detection of amblyopia risk factors in children. In this study cohort it was found to reliably detect amblyopia risk in children when compared to the 2003 and 2013 AAPOS referral criteria.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698615","annotations":[{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.873017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.711061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.370736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.272342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Pediatric ophthalmology","weight":0.269585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_ophthalmology"},{"name":"Amblyopia","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia"},{"name":"Strabismus","weight":0.213661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus"},{"name":"Cycloplegia","weight":0.211412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloplegia"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus","weight":0.133949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_for_Pediatric_Ophthalmology_and_Strabismus"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"American Association (19th century)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_(19th_century)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Limited liability company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company"},{"name":"Screener","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screener"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"List of tools for static code analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_for_static_code_analysis"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"The Spot","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spot"},{"name":"Lake Mary, Florida","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Mary,_Florida"}]}
