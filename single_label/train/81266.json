{"id":81266,"title":"In vitro and in vivo evaluation of the effectiveness of three dentin desensitizing treatment regimens.","abstract":"To evaluate the in vitro and in vivo effects of three treatment regimens on dentin permeability and reduction of dentin hypersensitivity (DH).The desensitization treatments were: Gluma Desensitizer PowerGel (GLU), MS Coat One (MSC), and dentin burnishing with fiber-resin burs (STB). A split-chamber device was used to determine the permeability of dentin slices cut from human molars in vitro. Fluid flow through dentin was recorded with a photochemical method after EDTA cleaning, albumin soaking and desensitization treatment (n = 10). 61 study participants with three severely hypersensitive teeth each were enrolled. Sensitivity was determined with an air stimulus before, immediately after treatment, and after 1, 3 and 6 months, using a verbal rating scale.From the 61 study participants enrolled, 52 completed the trial. Permeability at baseline and after albumin soaking was not significantly different. All treatments produced reduced fluid flow through dentin (P > 0.05). All treatments reduced DH significantly (no or moderate sensitivity). Statistical results revealed significant differences among the treatments (P = 0.03). Mann-Whitney comparisons showed GLU, STB < MSC.","date":"2014-09-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25208361","annotations":[{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.68746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.612649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.547778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.495698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.40255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.373306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.262097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.25805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.251242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.122386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Photosynthesis","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0172936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Hard water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_water"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Burnish","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnish"},{"name":"Cat allergy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_allergy"},{"name":"Bur","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bur"},{"name":"Permeation","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeation"},{"name":"Rating scale","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_scale"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"OpenGL Utility Library","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Utility_Library"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
