{"id":72912,"title":"Merkel cell carcinoma.","abstract":"A 92-year-old man presented for evaluation with a 1-month history of a rapidly growing asymptomatic pink nodule on his forearm. Biopsy results of the lesion demonstrated pathology consistent with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Immunohistochemical studies displayed positive cytoplasmic staining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, positive dot-like perinuclear staining for cytokeratin-20, diffuse cytoplasmic staining for neuron specific enolase, and no significant staining for S-100. Subsequent positron emission tomography did not reveal evidence of metastatic disease. Wide excision of the lesion was performed along with a sentinel node biopsy of his left axilla. The sentinel nodes were negative for MCC. Adjuvant radiation treatment of the tumor site was provided because the pathologist noted MCC within 2 mm of the deep margin.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24933855","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Sentinel lymph node","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_lymph_node"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.825521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.823712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Merkel cell carcinoma","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkel_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.771006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.728598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.661534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cytokeratin","weight":0.64515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokeratin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.638817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.634601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.592215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Merkel cell","weight":0.384444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkel_cell"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.311315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"S-100 protein","weight":0.183608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_protein"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Enolase 2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enolase_2"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"American English","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Nuclear envelope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_envelope"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
