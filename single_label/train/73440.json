{"id":73440,"title":"microRNA expression and biogenesis in cellular response to ionizing radiation.","abstract":"Increasing evidence demonstrates that the expression levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly change upon ionizing radiation (IR) and play a critical role in cellular response to IR. Although several radiation responsive miRNAs and their targets have been identified, little is known about how miRNAs expression and biogenesis is regulated by IR-caused DNA damage response (DDR). Hence, in this review, we summarize miRNA expression and biogenesis in cellular response to IR and mainly elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of miRNA expression and biogenesis from different aspects including ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, p53/p63/p73 family and other potential factors. Furthermore, we focus on ?Np73, which might be a potential regulator of miRNA expression and biogenesis in cellular response to IR. miRNAs could effectively activate the IR-induced DDR and modulate the radiation response and cellular radiosensitivity, which have an important potential clinical application. Therefore, thoroughly understanding the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs expression and biogenesis in radiation response will provide new insights for clinical cancer radiotherapy.
