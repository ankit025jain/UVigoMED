{"id":45181,"title":"Prognostic factors of hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated by transarterial chemoembolization.","abstract":"We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients treated by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in Chinese cohort. A total of 2,493 HCC patients treated by TACE were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into the younger group (n=1,877) or the elderly group (n=616) based upon their ages (cut-off value of 60 y/o). Chi-square test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare patients' characteristics. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to determine prognostic factors. When compared with the younger group, the elderly group had lower male/female ratio and family liver disease history ratio, as well as advanced stage or Child-Pugh grade B patients. The median survival time was 8 months and 27 months for the younger and the elderly group, respectively. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates in the younger group and the elderly group were 31.82%, 12.5%, 6.53%, and 84.66%, 53.28%, 28.39%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that HBV infection, AFP value, TNM stage, Child-Pugh class, portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) and tumor number were independent prognostic factors for the younger patients; the elderly ones had similar independent prognostic factors except for HBV infection. The elderly group had lower male/female ratio and family history ratio, as well as advanced stage or Child-Pugh grade B patients. The elderly seems to have better prognosis than the younger ones, which is probably related to the fact that the elderly have lower tumor burden and better liver function.
