{"id":30175,"title":"The effect on problematic drinking behavior of a brief motivational interview shortly after a first arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol: a randomized trial.","abstract":"In medical settings, motivational interviewing-based \"brief intervention\" (BI) counseling reduces alcohol-related risk-taking behavior and harm in high-risk populations. Individuals arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) are another at-risk population. We sought to determine whether a BI administered shortly after a first DUI arrest might decrease problematic drinking behavior.We enrolled 200 subjects (100 to each arm), and 181 (90.5%, 86 control and 95 BI) completed the 90-day follow-up. Mean (SD) age was 30 (10) years, and 50% were men. Mean (SD) blood alcohol concentration upon arrest was 0.14% (0.04%). Mean (SD) baseline AUDIT scores were 8.8 (5.8) among control subjects and 7.7 (6.3) among BI subjects. At 90 days, AUDIT scores decreased by a mean (SD) 4.7 (5.1) units among control subjects and 3.4 (5.0) among BI subjects (difference, -1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.8 to +0.1). The likelihood of subsequent binge drinking [relative risk (RR) 1.6; 95% CI, 0.8-3.0; BI vs. control], abstinence (RR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4-2.1), alcohol-related injury to self or others (RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1-2.4), and seeking treatment (RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8-1.7) did not differ.A single BI counseling session shortly after first-time DUI arrest does not reduce 90-day self-reported drinking behavior or increase seeking treatment for drinking beyond that which occurs without such a discussion.Therapeutic study, level III.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553532","annotations":[{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.752698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.64985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Binge drinking","weight":0.558456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_drinking"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.520011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.460569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.397581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.341325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.294452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Blood alcohol content","weight":0.286645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.153892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.153002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Driving under the influence","weight":0.148912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Arrest","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest"},{"name":"California's 4th State Senate district","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_4th_State_Senate_district"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Driving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Mel Gibson DUI incident","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Gibson_DUI_incident"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Business intelligence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence"},{"name":"Human rights in Saudi Arabia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
