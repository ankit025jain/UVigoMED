{"id":82862,"title":"Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of lesions at masticator space.","abstract":"We aim to review the normal anatomy and imaging appearance of masticator space lesions. Because the masticator space is not amenable to direct examination, cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging play an important role in diagnosis and characterization of lesions occurring there. Masticator space lesions can be classified on the basis of their origin into the following categories: inflammatory lesions, benign tumors, malignant tumors, vascular lesions, and developmental lesions. A diverse spectrum of malignant tumors and benign lesions are seen extending from the adjacent spaces. In addition, one should also be familiar with pseudolesions as well as post-treatment changes in the masticator space that can be mistaken for pathologic conditions.
