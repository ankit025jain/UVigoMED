{"id":83787,"title":"[Reprogramming mechanism and genetic stability of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)].","abstract":"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were reprogrammed from somatic cells using specific transcription factors. Bypassing the ethical issue caused by embryonic stem cells (ESCs), iPSCs can be successfully induced from a variety of cells, which makes iPSCs a powerful research tool for developmental biology. iPSCs have also become indispensable to the research of life science due to their broad potential applications. However, it's a big challenge to obtain iPSCs with high quality and genetic stability. Here, we review the research progress of increasing the reprogramming mechanism and genetic stability of iPSCs in order to provide references of reprogramming efficiency of iPSCs, reducing the cost, and addressing key points of iPSCs quality control, further promoting clinical application of the iPSCs.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252305","annotations":[{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Embryonic stem cell","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Somatic cell","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.723912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Pluripotent","weight":0.719357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluripotent"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Induced pluripotent stem cell","weight":0.707107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genetic drift","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift"},{"name":"Life sciences","weight":0.524799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_sciences"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Reprogramming","weight":0.447284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprogramming"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Applied mathematics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"}]}
