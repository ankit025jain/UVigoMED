{"id":47189,"title":"[Intraoperative body temperature changes and short-term outcomes of open and minimally invasive esophagectomy].","abstract":"Esophagectomy is a highly invasive procedure, and recently the use of minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) via thoracoscopy and laparoscopy increased, since this technique possibly enhances the recovery and outcomes of the patient compared with open esophagectomy (OE). However there is little data about intraoperative changes in body temperature during OE and MIE.We retrospectively investigated the intraoperative body temperature and the postoperative short-term outcomes of patients undergoing OE (n = 33) or MIE (n = 24). The rectal temperature was recorded at 5 time points (at the start of the surgery, 1, 3, and 5 h after the start of the surgery, and at the end of the surgery).The average body temperature at the start was similar between the OE and MIE groups (36.5 +/- 0.4 vs. 36.6 +/- 0.5 degrees C, P = 0.497). Throughout the surgery, the temperature of the OE group increased to 37.1 +/- 0.6 degrees C, but the temperature in the MIE group decreased to 36.1 +/- 0.8 degrees C. There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality and short-term complications between the two groups.Our study showed that the intraoperative temperature during MIE tended to decrease compared with OE, but the short-term outcomes were comparable.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601103","annotations":[{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.681757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.666368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.37573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.295179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Thermoregulation","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Normal human body temperature","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_human_body_temperature"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.127246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.119397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Thoracoscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracoscopy"},{"name":"Esophagectomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagectomy"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Channel 37","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_37"},{"name":"Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution_of_Engineers,_Sri_Lanka"},{"name":"Old English","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English"},{"name":"AJPW All Asia Tag Team Championship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJPW_All_Asia_Tag_Team_Championship"}]}
