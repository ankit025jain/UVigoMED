{"id":35470,"title":"Transoral robotic-assisted laryngeal cleft repair in the pediatric patient.","abstract":"To assess the feasibility of performing robotic-assisted laryngeal cleft repair in the pediatric population.Retrospective chart review at a tertiary academic children's hospital.All patients underwent transoral robotic-assisted laryngeal cleft repair from March 2011 to June 2013. Demographics, robotic docking time, operative time, and postoperative course and swallowing function were collected and analyzed.Five children, three male and two female, underwent successful transoral robotic-assisted laryngeal cleft repair for closure of a type I laryngeal cleft. Mean age at time of surgery was 21.6 months (standard deviation 6.1 months; range, 15-29 months). From case 1 to case 5, robotic docking time (18-10 minutes), robotic operative time (102-36 minutes), and total operating room time (173-105 minutes) decreased. There were no complications with time until extubation (range, 2-3 days), length of intensive care unit stay (range, 3-4 days), and total hospital stay (range, 3-5 days) within acceptable range following laryngeal cleft repair. Modified barium swallow (two patients) or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (three patients) was performed postoperatively, with all patients showing complete resolution of penetration and aspiration. In addition, all patients experienced subjective resolution of dysphagia and/or choking with feeds postoperatively.Transoral robotic-assisted laryngeal cleft repair may offer specific advantages over a traditional endoscopic approach. In our experience, the procedure was well tolerated and associated with definitive surgical cure in all patients. The scope of robotic technology continually expands and should be considered a feasible tool at an institution-based level.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24648210","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.767016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Dysphagia","weight":0.722417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.647608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.634837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.589497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.41924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.416132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.412609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0994886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Swallowing","weight":0.0858863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing"},{"name":"Cleft lip and palate","weight":0.0703685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleft_lip_and_palate"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Choking","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choking"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Barium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Barium swallow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium_swallow"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1810","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1810"},{"name":"1529","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1529"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Telescopic sight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescopic_sight"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"}]}
