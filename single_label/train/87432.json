{"id":87432,"title":"Radiation-induced effects to nontarget abdominal and pelvic viscera.","abstract":"Radiation injuries often occur during or after radiation therapy in the abdomen or pelvis. Although any organ in the abdomen or pelvis may be exposed to and injured by radiation therapy directed to a nearby organ, this article focuses on more frequently encountered imaging findings of inadvertent radiation damage. It is important for the radiologist to be familiar with the imaging appearances of inadvertent radiation damage to abdominopelvic viscera in order to sustain clinical relevance and not mistake radiation injuries for other entities.
