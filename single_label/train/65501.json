{"id":65501,"title":"Anticancer benefits of early versus late use of rapamycin in a rat model of urothelial carcinoma.","abstract":"We previously reported both in vivo and in vitro effects of rapamycin on urothelial carcinoma. Clinically, the use of rapamycin could not completely prevent the recurrence of urothelial carcinoma. Therefore, we designed this study to compare the difference of efficacy between early and late use of rapamycin in a rat model of urothelial carcinoma.The rat model of urothelial carcinoma was induced by adding 0.05% N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) to the drinking water for up to 20 weeks in male Fisher-344 rats. Rapamycin was fed orally from the 1st day, 5th week, 9th week, 13th week, and 17th week. The antitumor effects of different periods of rapamycin treatment were assessed grossly and microscopically.Papillary tumors of urinary bladder were successfully induced in the BBN group. Simultaneous use of rapamycin and BBN from the 1st day of treatment significantly reduced the tumor growth in urinary bladder: 80% of the rats had no tumor and 20% had low-grade tumors. Adding rapamycin from the 5th week was associated with more tumor growth: 20% of the rats had no tumors, 20% had low-grade tumors, and 60% had high-grade tumors. Moreover, in the groups with rapamycin treatment from the 9th week, 13th week, and 17th week, all rats developed high-grade papillary tumors in urinary bladder, as did the control group that received no rapamycin.The study results suggest that the anticancer effect of rapamycin on urothelial carcinoma is stage dependent. Early use of rapamycin provides better anticancer effect, whereas late use of rapamycin fails to inhibit the cancer growth.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815170","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.812318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.678393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.653499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.628461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.555312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Transitional cell carcinoma","weight":0.516275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.42345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.410982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.170474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.167001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Nitrosamine","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrosamine"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0565641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Renal papilla","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_papilla"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"}]}
