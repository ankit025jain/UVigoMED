{"id":90044,"title":"Update in radiation therapy for oral and maxillofacial tumors and dose mapping.","abstract":"Radiation therapy (RT) is an important modality in the treatment of head and neck cancers. Significant morbidity can result, however, because of exposure of normal tissues to high doses of RT. Advances in planning and delivery, especially intensity modulated radiation therapy, can reduce the risk of these toxicities by ensuring that the tumor and draining lymph nodes are adequately treated, while the surrounding organs and tissues at risk are avoided. Image guidance during treatment delivery allows for smaller margins around the tumor to account for variations in daily setup and positioning. All these advances help to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors.
