{"id":67086,"title":"[Experience of the use of extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of category III B chronic prostatitis].","abstract":"The randomized controlled study was aimed to the evaluation of the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) compared with drug treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis category IIIB. The study included 30 patients with category IIIB chronic prostatitis (CP IIIB), divided into two groups of 15 subjects. In group 1, prostate ESWT was used as monotherapy, in the group 2--only drug treatment. The impact was carried on the perineal region using standard radial ESWT device. The procedure was performed 1 time per week for 4 weeks according to the accepted protocol. All patients completed the treatment at outpatient settings. Control examinations of 30 patients were performed at 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks after treatment. Efficacy was evaluated using the NIH-CPSI score. All patients in group 1 had a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity and improvement of quality of life compared with group 2. The study showed that prostate ESWT is a simple and effective method of treatment of CP IIIB not accompanied by the development of side effects.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649762","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.805151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Prostatitis","weight":0.743956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatitis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.713026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.684857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.594769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.497581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.409501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.325809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Perineum","weight":0.291279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineum"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.041581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Shock wave","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave"},{"name":"Instrument landing system","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_landing_system"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Hong Kong motion picture rating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_motion_picture_rating_system"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Chronic bacterial prostatitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_bacterial_prostatitis"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Group 3 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_3_element"},{"name":"Radial artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_artery"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
