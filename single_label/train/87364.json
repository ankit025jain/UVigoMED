{"id":87364,"title":"[Progress on atlanto-axial pedicle screw fixation through posterior approach].","abstract":"The present of atlanto-axial pedicle screw fixation through posterior approach provide a new remedy for treating instability of pillow and cervical. A lot of researches have reported feasibility of atlanto-axial pedicle screw fixation, the results showed that it had advantages of easily exposure, less blood loss, shorter operative time, especially in treating as remedy fixation for atlanto-axial joint screw, atlas lateral mass screws and pedicle screw caused by injuries of tumor,inflammation and trauma. If not done properly, it can cause serious complications, such as iatrogenic fracture,injuries of vertebral artery and cervical spinal cord. Therefore,the safty and effectiveness of atlanto-axial pedicle screw fixation may be focus of research.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241477","annotations":[{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.836777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Vertebral artery","weight":0.771006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_artery"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.689089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.67362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.554445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Atlas (anatomy)","weight":0.468766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.101595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Atlanto-axial joint","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanto-axial_joint"},{"name":"Pedicle of vertebral arch","weight":0.0523017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicle_of_vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
