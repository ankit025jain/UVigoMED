{"id":47974,"title":"A prospective study of macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1/GDF15) and risk of colorectal cancer.","abstract":"Chronic inflammation plays a role in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). The novel plasma inflammatory biomarker macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1, GDF15) may have a direct mechanistic role in colorectal carcinogenesis.We conducted a prospective, nested, case-control study of incident CRC among men and women who provided a prediagnostic blood specimen. We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure MIC-1 and examined associations between quintiles of MIC-1 and CRC using logistic regression adjusted for matching factors (age and date of blood draw), risk factors, and other plasma inflammatory markers. We also assessed the relationship between MIC-1 levels and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2)/cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme status in tumors with available tissue for analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.Compared with men and women within the lowest quintile of plasma MIC-1, the multivariable relative risk (RR) for CRC was 1.93 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27 to 2.94) for the highest quintile (P linear trend = .004). In an exploratory analysis, we found that among individuals with high plasma MIC-1 levels (quintiles 2-5), compared with nonuse, regular use of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was associated with a lower risk of PTGS2-positive CRC (multivariable RR = 0.60; 95% confidence interval = 0.41 to 0.88) but not PTGS2-negative CRC (multivariable RR = 1.21; 95% CI = 0.71 to 2.07). In contrast, among individuals with low MIC-1 levels (quintile 1), aspirin and NSAID use was not associated with a lower risk of PTGS2-positive CRC (multivariable RR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.21 to 1.54) or PTGS2-negative CRC (multivariable RR = 1.41; 95% CI = 0.47 to 4.23).Our results support an association between higher levels of circulating MIC-1 (GDF15) and CRC. Aspirin/NSAID use appeared to lower risk of PTGS2-positive cancers, particularly among individuals with high levels of circulating MIC-1.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565956","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.891569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.837399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.837012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.786361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.760924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.742176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.673895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.414478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.390213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.330597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.285023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"PTGS2","weight":0.238577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTGS2"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.027246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Exploratory data analysis","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"}]}
