{"id":62279,"title":"[Progress of study on circulating microRNAs in hematologic malignancies].","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of tumor. Recently, it is discovered that circulating microRNA exist stably in body fluids, such as serum/plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, urine, breast milk and so on. Circulating microRNA profiles now have been associated with different hematologic malignancy types, disease states and prognosis. They may serve as a new class of non-invasive diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers, and even the potential therapeutic targets in hematologic malignancies. In this article, the circulating miRNA, existent pattern and function of circulating miRNA, and circulating miRNA and hematologic malignancies are reviewed.
