{"id":56656,"title":"[SD-OCT contribution in congenital achromatopsia diagnosis (6 patients)].","abstract":"Achromatopsia (ACH) is a congenital autosomal recessive cone disorder. The puspose is to describe particular SD-OCT macular images in ACH.The study included 6 patients from 3 consanguineous Tunisian families with congenital nystagmus and amblyopia with ACH. All patients had clinical examination with fundus photography, autofluorescence, 100-Hue Color vision and the appearance and thickness of all retinal layers were evaluated by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).All patients had ACH. The feature was loss of inner- and outer-segments (IS/OS) with disruption of the ciliary layer on OCT and an appearance of partial-thickness hole in the outer macular retina.This feature seems to be characteristic of ACH. SD-OCT correlated to clinic signs help the diagnosis.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655792","annotations":[{"name":"Color vision","weight":0.873144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision"},{"name":"Pathologic nystagmus","weight":0.835104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_nystagmus"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Autosomal recessive","weight":0.792675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_recessive"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.620215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Achromatopsia","weight":0.597164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achromatopsia"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.581468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Amblyopia","weight":0.529774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.499276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.491167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.428835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Consanguinity","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consanguinity"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.233016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Cone cell","weight":0.167974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.141013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0491823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hue","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Autofluorescence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofluorescence"},{"name":"Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory_of_Swiss_Heritage_Sites"},{"name":"Tunisia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia"},{"name":"Cilium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium"},{"name":"Automated Clearing House","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
