{"id":31571,"title":"Vascularization of primary and secondary ossification centres in the human growth plate.","abstract":"The switch from cartilage template to bone during endochondral ossification of the growth plate requires a dynamic and close interaction between cartilage and the developing vasculature. Vascular invasion of the primarily avascular hypertrophic chondrocyte zone brings chondroclasts, osteoblast- and endothelial precursor cells into future centres of ossification.Vascularization of human growth plates of polydactylic digits was studied by immunohistochemistry, confocal-laser-scanning-microscopy and RT-qPCR using markers specific for endothelial cells CD34 and CD31, smooth muscle cells ?-SMA, endothelial progenitor cells CD133, CXCR4, VEGFR-2 and mesenchymal progenitor cells CD90 and CD105. In addition, morphometric analysis was performed to quantify RUNX2+ and DLX5+ hypertrophic chondrocytes, RANK+ chondro- and osteoclasts, and CD133+ progenitors in different zones of the growth plate.New vessels in ossification centres were formed by sprouting of CD34+ endothelial cells that did not co-express the mature endothelial cell marker CD31. These immature vessels in the growth plate showed no abluminal coverage with ?-SMA+ smooth muscle cells, but in their close proximity single CD133+ precursor cells were found that did not express VEGFR-2, a marker for endothelial lineage commitment. In periosteum and in the perichondrial groove of Ranvier that harboured CD90+/CD105+ chondro-progenitors, in contrast, mature vessels were found stabilized by ?-SMA+ smooth muscle cells.Vascularization of ossification centres of the growth plate was mediated by sprouting of capillaries coming from the bone collar or by intussusception rather than by de-novo vessel formation involving endothelial progenitor cells. Vascular invasion of the joint anlage was temporally delayed compared to the surrounding joint tissue.","date":"2014-09-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25164565","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoblast","weight":0.905962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoblast"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Chondrocyte","weight":0.886361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrocyte"},{"name":"Periosteum","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Osteoclast","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoclast"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Endochondral ossification","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endochondral_ossification"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.774734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Epiphyseal plate","weight":0.552571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyseal_plate"},{"name":"Myocyte","weight":0.545297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.389465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Cluster of differentiation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_of_differentiation"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polydactyly","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydactyly"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"CD31","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD31"},{"name":"Ossification center","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification_center"},{"name":"Endoglin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoglin"},{"name":"CD90","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD90"},{"name":"RUNX2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUNX2"},{"name":"Kinase insert domain receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase_insert_domain_receptor"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"CXCR4","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCR4"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Precursor cell","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_cell"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0116672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"}]}
