{"id":42150,"title":"Prevalence of hepatitis d infection in patients with hepatitis B virus-related liver diseases in Accra, Ghana.","abstract":"Hepatitis D virus (HDV), a defective RNA virus which depends on hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its replication and expression, appears to be highly pathogenic and modifies the natural history of HBV infection. Two types of infection, co-infection and super-infection are recognised. During infection, anti-delta antibodies appear in serum and can be detected by Enzyme linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).We determined the prevalence of hepatitis D infection amongst HBsAg-positive patients with HBV-related liver diseases in Accra, Ghana using an Enzyme linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.We collected blood samples from 53 patients with hepatitis B-related liver diseases. The sera were analysed using a commercially available kit, the EIA-ANTI-HDV, a third generation ELISA kit (Globe Diagnostics, Italy).There were 39 males (73.6%) and 14 females (26.4%) giving a male:female ratio of about 3:1.The mean age of patients was 38.6 years (range, 15-75). Six patients were reactive for anti-delta antibodies, yielding a HDV sero-prevalence of 11.3%. A higher proportion of males were anti-HDV positive (9.4%) compared to females (1.9%) but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.350). Anti-HDV was detected in 4(22.2%) patients with chronic hepatitis B, 1(7.6%) with cirrhosis of the liver and 1(5.3%) with hepatocellular carcinoma.The prevalence of HDV infection amongst patients with liver disease in Accra with HBV-related liver diseases appears to be high compared to developed countries but similar to several developing countries. No significant difference exists in gender prevalences. A concerted public health effort is required to reduce this high prevalence rate.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872264","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis D","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_D"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Superinfection","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superinfection"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"RNA virus","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.792902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.63497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.397972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.352706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.343501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Ghana","weight":0.231257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.204946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.134165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.111585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.0539337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Biostatistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostatistics"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Hepato-biliary diseases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepato-biliary_diseases"}]}
