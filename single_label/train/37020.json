{"id":37020,"title":"Neuroimaging of white matter injury, intraventricular and cerebellar hemorrhage.","abstract":"White matter injury and hemorrhage are common findings in extremely preterm infants. Large hemorrhages and extensive cystic lesions are identified with cranial ultrasound. MRI, which is more sensitive, is especially useful in the identification of small intraventricular hemorrhage; cerebellar hemorrhage; punctate lesion in the white matter and cerebellum; and diffuse, noncystic white matter injury. Imaging sequences such as diffusion-weighted, diffusion tensor, and susceptibility weighted imaging may improve recognition and prediction of outcome. These techniques improve understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of white matter injury and its effects on brain development and neurodevelopmental outcome.
