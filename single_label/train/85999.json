{"id":85999,"title":"Mononuclear phagocytes and airway epithelial cells: novel sources of matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.","abstract":"Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) promotes lung fibrotic responses to bleomycin in mice. Although prior studies reported that MMP-8 levels are increased in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from IPF patients, neither the bioactive forms nor the cellular sources of MMP-8 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients have been identified. It is not known whether MMP-8 expression is dys-regulated in IPF leukocytes or whether MMP-8 plasma levels correlate with IPF outcomes. Our goal was to address these knowledge gaps.We measured MMP-8 levels and forms in blood and lung samples from IPF patients versus controls using ELISAs, western blotting, and qPCR, and assessed whether MMP-8 plasma levels in 73 IPF patients correlate with rate of lung function decline and mortality. We used immunostaining to localize MMP-8 expression in IPF lungs. We quantified MMP-8 levels and forms in blood leukocytes from IPF patients versus controls.IPF patients have increased BALF, whole lung, and plasma levels of soluble MMP-8 protein. Active MMP-8 is the main form elevated in IPF lungs. MMP-8 mRNA levels are increased in monocytes from IPF patients, but IPF patients and controls have similar levels of MMP-8 in PMNs. Surprisingly, macrophages and airway epithelial cells are the main cells expressing MMP-8 in IPF lungs. Plasma and BALF MMP-8 levels do not correlate with decline in lung function and/or mortality in IPF patients.Blood and lung MMP-8 levels are increased in IPF patients. Active MMP-8 is the main form elevated in IPF lungs. Surprisingly, blood monocytes, lung macrophages, and airway epithelial cells are the main cells in which MMP-8 is upregulated in IPF patients. Plasma and BALF MMP-8 levels are unlikely to serve as a prognostic biomarker for IPF patients. These results provide new information about the expression patterns of MMP-8 in IPF patients.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828408","annotations":[{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.903799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Bleomycin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleomycin"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Phagocyte","weight":0.765459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocyte"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.756512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.741285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.541916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.485979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.290125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.261989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.0978921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
