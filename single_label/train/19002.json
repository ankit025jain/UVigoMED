{"id":19002,"title":"Ruptured anterior mitral leaflet aneurysm in aortic valve infective endocarditis--evaluation by three-dimensional echocardiography.","abstract":"Ruptured aneurysm of the anterior mitral leaflet is a rare but a devastating complication secondary to aortic valve infective endocarditis. We report a case of 30-year-old male with native aortic valve endocarditis who was referred to us for evaluation of worsening of heart failure after an initial period of responsiveness to antibiotics. Detailed evaluation with two-dimensional and three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography revealed ruptured anterior mitral leaflet aneurysm with severe eccentric mitral regurgitation along with a large vegetation on the aortic valve. The patient underwent successful surgical closure of the defect along with aortic valve replacement.","date":"2014-04-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749164","annotations":[{"name":"Infective endocarditis","weight":0.886293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infective_endocarditis"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Mitral regurgitation","weight":0.846041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_regurgitation"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Aortic valve replacement","weight":0.687243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_replacement"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.653499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Valve replacement","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_replacement"}]}
