{"id":66005,"title":"Kidney cancer incidence and mortality among American Indians and Alaska Natives in the United States, 1990-2009.","abstract":"We describe rates and trends in kidney cancer incidence and mortality and identify disparities between American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) and White populations.To improve identification of AI/AN race, incidence and mortality data were linked with Indian Health Service (IHS) patient records. Analysis focused on residents of IHS Contract Health Service Delivery Area counties; Hispanics were excluded. We calculated age-adjusted kidney cancer incidence (2001-2009) and death rates (1990-2009) by sex, age, and IHS region.AI/AN persons have a 1.6 times higher kidney cancer incidence and a 1.9 times higher kidney cancer death rate than Whites. Despite a significant decline in kidney cancer death rates for Whites (annual percentage change [APC]?=?-0.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?-0.5, 0.0), death rates for AI/AN persons remained stable (APC = 0.4; 95% CI = -0.7, 1.5). Kidney cancer incidence rates rose more rapidly for AI/AN persons (APC = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.2, 5.8) than for Whites (APC = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.4, 2.8).AI/AN individuals have greater risk of developing and dying of kidney cancers. Incidence rates have increased faster in AI/AN populations than in Whites. Death rates have decreased slightly in Whites but remained stable in AI/AN populations. Racial disparities in kidney cancer are widening.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754655","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Alaska","weight":0.701504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.67526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.659877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.640298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.636741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.596468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.502063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Native Americans in the United States","weight":0.449076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Alaska Natives","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Natives"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.274836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.228079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.201725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.157988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"Indian Health Service","weight":0.122756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Health_Service"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.020329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Lord's Prayer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's_Prayer"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"}]}
