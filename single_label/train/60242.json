{"id":60242,"title":"[Kikuchi disease in a young Finnish man].","abstract":"Kikuchi disease is a lymphadenitis becoming manifest with flu-like symptoms and occurring particularly in Southeast Asian women. The disease is characterized by recurrent febrile episodes with enlarged and tender lymph nodes occurring most commonly in the neck region. With the exception of leukopenia, laboratory findings may be scarce. Diagnosis of the disease is based on necrotizing inflammation found upon histological examination of the lymph node, typical clinical picture and exclusion of other causes. There is no specific treatment, but the course of the disease is usually benign with spontaneously recovery within a couple of months.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964495","annotations":[{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.902289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.667628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.65757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Kikuchi disease","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kikuchi_disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Southeast Asia","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Finland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"}]}
