{"id":48008,"title":"Pathway-based drug repositioning using causal inference.","abstract":"Recent in vivo studies showed new hopes of drug repositioning through causality inference from drugs to disease. Inspired by their success, here we present an in silico method for building a causal network (CauseNet) between drugs and diseases, in an attempt to systematically identify new therapeutic uses of existing drugs.Unlike the traditional 'one drug-one target-one disease' causal model, we simultaneously consider all possible causal chains connecting drugs to diseases via target- and gene-involved pathways based on rich information in several expert-curated knowledge-bases. With statistical learning, our method estimates transition likelihood of each causal chain in the network based on known drug-disease treatment associations (e.g. bexarotene treats skin cancer).To demonstrate its validity, our method showed high performance (AUC = 0.859) in cross validation. Moreover, our top scored prediction results are highly enriched in literature and clinical trials. As a showcase of its utility, we show several drugs for potential re-use in Crohn's Disease.We successfully developed a computational method for discovering new uses of existing drugs based on casual inference in a layered drug-target-pathway-gene- disease network. The results showed that our proposed method enables hypothesis generation from public accessible biological data for drug repositioning.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564553","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.710954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.657002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.501848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.456322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.432629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.414275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.402906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"In silico","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Machine learning","weight":0.35878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.195637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Inference","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0392089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Computational chemistry","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Cross-validation (statistics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)"},{"name":"Bexarotene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bexarotene"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"High-performance liquid chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_liquid_chromatography"},{"name":"Side chain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_chain"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Positioning (marketing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)"},{"name":"Reuse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuse"},{"name":"Biological data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_data"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
