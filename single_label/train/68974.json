{"id":68974,"title":"YY1-C/EBP?-miR34a regulatory circuitry is involved in renal cell carcinoma progression.","abstract":"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common urological malignancy. It remains unclear, however, whether Yin YangÂ 1 (YY1) plays a functional role in the development of human RCC. In the present study, we demonstrated that levels of YY1 were significantly increased in primary RCC tissues when compared to these levels in the matched healthy tissues. YY1 knockdown inhibited cell growth, migration and invasion of RCC cells. Additionally, we highlighted a positive feedback-loop pathway resulting in YY1 upregulation. We observed that overexpression of YY1 caused repression of C/EBP? and the inhibition of C/EBP? led to the suppression of miR-34a. Since YY1 is a direct target of miR-34a, the low level of miR-34a increased the expression of YY1, promoting the aggressiveness of RCC cells. Furthermore, this feedforward mechanism was found in RCC tissues. We observed that miR-34a was downregulated in the pools of cancer tissues when compared to that of the normal tissues. The expression of miR-34a displayed an inverse correlation with YY1, but a positive correlation with C/EBP?. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of a novel regulatory circuitry for YY1 activation in maintaining the aggressive phenotypes of RCC.
