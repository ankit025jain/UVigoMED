{"id":83506,"title":"[The effect of altered oxygen partial pressure on the resisitance to hypoxia and expression of oxygen-sensitive genes in Drosophila melanogaster].","abstract":"As a result of resistance test to hypoxia of Drosophilas melanogaster of Oregon strain, we identified a high resistance (Group II) and low resistance (Group III) subpopulations of flies. Flies from groups II and III were incubated in a constant normobaric hypoxia (Po2=62-64 mm Hg) for 10 generations. A highly resistant group (Group IV) were exposed to a shortterm anoxia (Po,=1,5 mm Hg, 5 min) every generation. Larvae from Groups II, III, and IV demonstrated significantly elevated levels of Sir and CG 14740 expression. Larvae from Group II had a significantly higher expression of CG 14740 compared to group III. The restitution time after exposure to anoxia was significantly reduced in Group II (on 31% of the control values) Our results suggest that long-term adaptation to low oxygen partial pressure of highly resistant Drosophila significantly reduces the time of restitution and increases the expression of Sir2 and CG14740 genes.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335240","annotations":[{"name":"Drosophila melanogaster","weight":0.92372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.626216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.575548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Drosophila","weight":0.471621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Partial pressure","weight":0.239737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.104145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0654645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Fly","weight":0.0312312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly"},{"name":"Sir2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir2"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Po (river)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_(river)"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Sir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Metabotropic glutamate receptor","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabotropic_glutamate_receptor"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Carbon group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_group"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Restitution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restitution"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
