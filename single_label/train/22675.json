{"id":22675,"title":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis PPE family protein Rv1808 manipulates cytokines profile via co-activation of MAPK and NF-?B signaling pathways.","abstract":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an extremely successful intracellular pathogen armed with multiple tactics to subvert host immunity. PPE (Pro-Pro-Glu) family exclusively distributed in mycobacteria might be responsible for the virulence and pathogenicity of M.tuberculosis. The up-regulation of Rv1808 (PPE32) in many conditions prompted us to define its role in host innate immune response.The Rv1808 encoding gene was expressed in nonpathogenic fast growing Mycobacterium smegmatis, mycobacteria- Escherichia coli shuttle plasmid pNITmyc served as control. RT-PCR and ELISA were used to detect the transcription and translation of host cytokines in culture supernatant from macrophage incubated with purified Rv1808 protein. Pharmacological inhibitors were applied to confirm the specificity of the effector interfering of host signaling.Recombinant Ms_Rv1808 survived better than Ms_pNITmyc within macrophage, accompanied by slightly higher host cell death. Rv1808 protein is associated with the cell wall and exposed on the cell surface. Physical binding of Rv1808 to TLR2 resulted in increase in the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) and pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF-?) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) possibly via co-activation of NF-?B and MAPK (p38MAPK, JNK and ERK) signalling.Cell wall associated Rv1808 protein manipulated the host cytokines via MAPK and NF-?B signaling pathways.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525621","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin
