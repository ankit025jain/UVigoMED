{"id":71074,"title":"Semen quality of consecutive ejaculates from cancer patients for fertility preservation.","abstract":"To study variations in semen parameters among cancer patients who visited a sperm banking clinic before undergoing cancer treatment.Retrospective, consecutive study.University-based hospital.Eighty-six patients, diagnosed with various cancers, undergoing multiple semen collections on 5 consecutive days, for fertility preservation, between 2004 andÂ 2013.None.Within- and between-subject coefficients of variation were estimated using a random-effects analysis of variance to assess the consistency of semen parameters (volume, sperm concentration, motility, rapid motility, total motile sperm count, and computer-based sperm parameters), whereas intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to assess the size of the between-component of variance relative to the total component of variance.When analyzing semen parameters over a maximum of 5 consecutive days, only the semen volume was significantly reduced in day-1 and -3 samples compared with the first sample. Almost all of the parameters showed high ICC values, suggesting that within-subject fluctuations were small relative to the between-subject variability. The highest ICC values were noted in volume (ICC 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.89), followed by total motile count (ICC 0.71; 95% CI 0.30-0.89); the least consistent measure was wobble (ICC 0.14; 95% CI -0.13, 0.51).Repeated ejaculates from cancer patients did not show substantial variation in semen quality.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25108463","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.773497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.635945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.555767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Fertility preservation","weight":0.533237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_preservation"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.523039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.43468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.316134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Semen quality","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_quality"},{"name":"Ejaculation","weight":0.240437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculation"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.204114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Semen analysis","weight":0.144571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_analysis"},{"name":"Coefficient of variation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Statistical Methods for Research Workers","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_Methods_for_Research_Workers"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"International Cricket Council","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Consistent estimator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bank","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank"}]}
