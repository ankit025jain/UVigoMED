{"id":89180,"title":"Failure modes and fracture toughness in partially torn ligaments and tendons.","abstract":"Ligaments and tendons are commonly torn during injury, yet the likelihood that untreated initial tears could lead to further tearing or even full rupture has proven challenging to predict. In this work, porcine Achilles tendon and human anterior longitudinal ligament samples were tested using both standard fracture toughness methods and complex loading conditions. Failure modes for each of 14 distinct testing cases were evaluated using a total of 131 soft tissue tests. Results showed that these soft tissues were able to completely resist any further crack propagation of an initial tear, regardless of fiber orientation or applied loading condition. Consequently, the major concern for patients with tendon or ligament tears is likely not reduction in ultimate tissue strength due to stress risers at the tip of the tear, but rather a question of whether or not the remaining cross-section is large enough to support the anticipated loading.
