{"id":15250,"title":"Screening travellers to high-endemic countries for infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis using interferon gamma release assay; a prospective study.","abstract":"International travel from low-incidence to high-incidence countries for tuberculosis (TB) is regarded as a risk factor for acquiring TB infection. In this prospective study among long-term travellers we examined the incidence of TB infection using Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) test and compared these data with results from a visit to the TB department to which all long-term travellers were routinely referred.Immunocompetent adults, travelling for 13-52 weeks to TB-endemic countries, donated blood pre- and post-travel for IGRA. The pre-travel IGRA was only tested in case of a positive IGRA post-travel. Results from their visit(s) to the TB department for TST pre- and post-travel were collected and compared with study results.We found two IGRA conversions in a group of 516 travellers, resulting in an attack rate (AR) of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.5 - 13.9) and an incidence rate (IR) of 0.85 per 1000 person-months (95% CI: 0.1-3.1).We found 5 tuberculin skin test (TST) conversions, resulting in AR of 1.9% (5/261; 95% CI: 0.6 - 4.4) and an IR of 4.26 per 1000 person-months (95% CI: 1.38- 9.94). In our study these converters all had a negative IGRA. One traveller however, who was retested later at the TB department due to a positive TST, then appeared to have seroconverted.The risk of long-term travellers among our study population acquiring TB infection is low. We conclude that post-travel IGRA alone could be used for screening for TB infection among long-term travellers to high-endemic TB countries, but preferably not earlier than 8Â weeks after return. One might even argue that IGRA testing should be limited to only those travellers who are going to work in a medical setting. A person with a positive IGRA should be referred to a TB physician for further evaluation.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25248372","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.928595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Interferon-gamma","weight":0.884812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon-gamma"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.823736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.755108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.751623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.687637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.548379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Tuberculin","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.453709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.1216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Travel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel"},{"name":"Attack rate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_rate"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tuberculosis diagnosis","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Arkansas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"1352","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1352"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
