{"id":55580,"title":"Bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation: a management dilemma.","abstract":"A female patient suffered from gradual decline of vision for few months. She presented with bilateral multiple pigmented choroidal tumours, associated with overlying retinal changes. The clinical presentation suggested bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation (BDUMP) syndrome, which is a paraneoplastic disease, although there was no evidence of any concurrent malignancy. The periodic systemic surveillance that was undertaken for the following 4?years failed to reveal any occult cancer. Nevertheless, there has been relentless progressive deterioration in vision as a consequence of BDUMP syndrome. The management of the declining vision in BDUMP syndrome is challenging and controversial.
