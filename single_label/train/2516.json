{"id":2516,"title":"[Thyroid dysfunction and the hemostatic system].","abstract":"Whether there is a link between thyroid dysfunction and different impairments in the hemostatic system is discussed. The level of thyroid hormones is an essential factor that influences the coagulation system. Thyroid dysfunction affects the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis, by increasing the risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage in hyperthyroidism. However, there is no consensus of opinion regarding the mechanisms of the described hemostatic changes in the literature.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509900","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperthyroidism","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.777456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.710712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.391938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Antihemorrhagic","weight":0.120727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihemorrhagic"},{"name":"Thyroid disease","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_disease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
