{"id":63373,"title":"[Soft-tissue mass as a rare presentation of sarcoidosis].","abstract":"The most important differential diagnosis of a soft-tissue mass is soft-tissue sarcoma, and the diagnostic process should be aimed at diagnosing or excluding this.A 28-year-old man was referred to the surgeon with a progressive painless swelling on the right shoulder. Diagnostic imaging suggested a sarcoma with axillary lymphadenopathy. Repeatedly biopsy revealed a non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was finally made, after exclusion of malignancy and infectious causes.When a patient presents with a soft-tissue mass, malignant causes such as soft-tissue sarcoma should be excluded. If pathological investigation reveals a granulomatous inflammation, a soft-tissue mass as a rare presentation of sarcoidosis should be considered. It is, however, important to first exclude a sarcoid-like reaction.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447669","annotations":[{"name":"Sarcoidosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.862391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.545335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.349719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.186179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.147371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.111007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Mathematical induction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 28","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_28"}]}
