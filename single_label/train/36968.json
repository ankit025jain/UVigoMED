{"id":36968,"title":"Survey of paediatricians' opinions on a regional paediatric telecardiology service.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to evaluate consultant general paediatricians' opinions of a UK paediatric telecardiology service.A structured questionnaire was developed and sent to all consultant paediatricians working in a district general hospital in Northern Ireland.Paediatricians (n = 35) regarded the regional paediatric telecardiology service as very useful and of good value for money. Paediatricans in hospitals without access to telecardiology expressed a desire to join the network (86%, 12/14). More frequent use of the paediatric telecardiology service was associated with increased confidence in performing echocardiography and using the telemedicine equipment and a special interest in neonatology. The vast majority of paediatricians (32/35, 91%) believed that there should be a shared clinical responsibility for the patient following a teleconsultation. A total of 33/35 (94%) stated that the telephone costs of the consultation should be paid by the paediatrician but that the professional time of the cardiologist should be paid by the tertiary centre (29/35, 83%).Paediatricians have consistently positive experiences of a regional paediatric telecardiology service. They believe that clinical responsibility is shared, and there should not be any professional fee for telemedicine activities.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528530","annotations":[{"name":"Northern Ireland","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Ireland","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.638371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.532936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Cardiology","weight":0.349951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.239972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Neonatology","weight":0.23109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatology"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.21264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Telemedicine","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemedicine"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.123079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Money","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Fee","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"1214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1214"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Northern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_United_States"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Value (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics)"},{"name":"Advocacy group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
