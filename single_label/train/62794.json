{"id":62794,"title":"Parvovirus B19 (B19) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections and  anti-erythropoietin (anti-EPO) antibodies in patients on dialysis  hyporesponsive to erythropoietin therapy.","abstract":"Approximately 10% of patients receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) do not respond to the treatment. We evaluated parvovirus B19 (B19) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections and antierythropoietin (anti-EPO) antibodies as potential causes of anemia in dialyzed patients, hyporesponsive to rHuEPO.Data from 120 dialyzed patients, receiving rHuEPO alfa, were collected: demographic characteristics, rHuEPO dose, duration of rHuEPO treatment and time on dialysis, etiology of chronic kidney disease and transfusion history. Serology and PCR were performed to address B19 and CMV infection status. An ELISA was developed to detect anti-EPO antibodies.rHuEPO resistance correlated with high ferritin levels (p = 0.001) and short time on dialysis (p = 0.012). B19 DNA was found in 10 (8.3%) dialyzed patients and CMV DNA was detected in 33 (27.5%). There was no significant correlation between B19 infection and anemia,while a tendency of correlation between active CMV infection and hemoglobin levels or hematocrit value (p= 0.069 and p= 0.070, respectively) has been observed. Anti-EPO antibodies were not detected in any patient.B19 infection is a rare complication in dialyzed patients and should be investigated after exclusion of other common causes, while CMV infection is rather common. The role of CMV infection in the hyporesponsiveness in dialyzed patients should be further evaluated in other studies. Our data suggest that anti-EPO antibodies are not involved in rHuEPO resistance in this population.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513539","annotations":[{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.951721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Erythropoietin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"},{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.750864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Parvovirus B19","weight":0.741884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvovirus_B19"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.720731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Parvovirus","weight":0.680784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvovirus"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.329746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
