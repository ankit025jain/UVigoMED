{"id":4398,"title":"[Analysis on depression of patients with advanced schistosomiasis and its influencing factors].","abstract":"To explore the status of depression in patients with advanced schistosomiasis and its influencing factors, so as to provide the evidence for improving psychological interventions.A total of 206 patients with advanced schistosomiasis were investigated with the self-designed general information questionnaire, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, and WHOQOL-BREF Form.Among the 206 cases, the incidence of depression was 69.4%, and depression was negatively related to the quality of life (P = 0.000). The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the times of hospitalization (? = 0.442, P = 0.007) was a risk factor for depression, while the high education levels (? = -0.583, P = 0.011) and the history of portal hypertension operation (? = -0.917, P = 0.000) were the protective factors.The incidence of depression in advanced schistosomiasis patients is high, and it is influenced by various factors. Therefore, we should take corresponding interventions to reduce its occurrence.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345151","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.785364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.636827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.494766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.430951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.23402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Portal hypertension","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_hypertension"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Education in Greece","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Greece"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"}]}
