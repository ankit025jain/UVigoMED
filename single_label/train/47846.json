{"id":47846,"title":"MicroRNA expression might predict prognosis of epithelial hepatoblastoma.","abstract":"Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common primary liver cancer in childhood. The fetal and mixed embryonal/fetal epithelial subtypes of HB differ not only in grade of differentiation but probably also in prognosis. We aimed to determine microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns of the main subtypes of epithelial HBs to reveal differences and relate them to survival. We studied 20 cases of epithelial HB, subtyped as pure fetal (n?=?12) or embryonal/fetal (n?=?8). Tissues were sampled according to subtype to arrive at 15 purely fetal and eight purely embryonal samples (n?=?8) and 15 samples of non-tumorous surrounding liver (SL). Relative expression of miR-17-5p, miR-18a, miR-21, miR-34a, miR-96, miR-122, miR-181a, miR-195, miR-210, miR-214, miR-221, miR-222, miR-223, and miR-224 was determined by TaqMan MicroRNA Assays applying miR-140 as reference. A higher level of miR-18a (p?<?0.01) was found in embryonal samples than in fetal samples. Lower miR-17-5p, miR-195, miR-210, miR-214, and higher miR-221 levels were detected in fetal samples (p?<?0.02) in comparison with SL samples, whereas a lower miR-122 level was observed in embryonal samples (p?<?0.003). Histological subtype did not correlate with survival; however, high miR-21, low miR-222, and low miR-224 levels proved to be independently prognostic for HB with significantly increased overall survival (p?<?0.03). The fetal and embryonal components of epithelial HB, as well as SL, revealed different miRNA expression patterns. Furthermore, miR-21, miR-222, and miR-224 levels predict overall survival of HB patients regardless of epithelial subtype.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570391","annotations":[{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.913416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.701573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.695352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Hepatoblastoma","weight":0.632839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatoblastoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.58252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.378975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"TaqMan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaqMan"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"223","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/223"},{"name":"224","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/224"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"222","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/222"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Subtypes of HIV","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtypes_of_HIV"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Fish measurement","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_measurement"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"}]}
