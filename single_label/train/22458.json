{"id":22458,"title":"Healthcare worker perceived barriers to early initiation of antiretroviral and tuberculosis therapy among Tanzanian inpatients.","abstract":"Clinical trials have shown that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis saves lives, but models for implementation of this new strategy have been under-studied in real-world settings.To identify the barriers and possible solutions for implementing concurrent early treatment with antiretroviral and anti-tuberculosis therapy in a large East African referral hospital where the prevalence of both infections is high.In-depth interviews among hospital administrators, laboratory technicians, nurses, pharmacists, and physicians.Twenty-six hospital staff identified six key barriers and corresponding solutions to promote rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected inpatients with tuberculosis. These include revising systems of medication delivery, integrating care between inpatient and outpatient systems, training hospital nurses to counsel and initiate medications in inpatients, and cultivating a team approach to consistent guideline implementation.Most barriers identified by hospital staff were easily surmountable with reorganization, training, and policy changes at minimal cost. Efforts to reduce mortality for HIV and tuberculosis co-infected patients in accordance with new World Health Organization guidelines are currently hampered by implementation barriers in real-world settings. Our findings suggest that these can be overcome with strategic enactment of simple, realistic interventions to promote early dual treatment for HIV/tuberculosis co-infected patients.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551061","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.735738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.57651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Tanzania","weight":0.492394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.247364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.101002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Health administration","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_administration"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Technician","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technician"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Initiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation"},{"name":"East Africa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Africa"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Barrister","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"}]}
