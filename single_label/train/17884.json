{"id":17884,"title":"Immunogenicity of a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and impact on carriage in Venezuelan children at risk of invasive pneumococcal diseases.","abstract":"We evaluated the immunogenicity of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), and its impact on pneumococcal carriage in Venezuelan children at high risk for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD).82 children (age 2-59 months) with sickle cell anemia (n=22), chronic heart disease (n=19), HIV infection (n=12), immune-suppressive therapy (n=11) and other IPD-predisposing conditions (n=18) were vaccinated with PCV7 according to CDC-recommended age-related immunization schedules. Blood samples were taken to determine the concentration of IgG antibody, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to isolate Streptococcus pneumoniae, before the first vaccine dose and 1 month after completion of the vaccination schedule.Pneumococcal carriage prior to the first immunization was 27% (n=22), with the most frequently carried serotypes being vaccine serotypes 6B (22%) and 14 (13%). One month after completion of the vaccination scheme pneumococcal carriage was 22% (n=17), dominated by non-vaccine serotypes 19A (24%) and 7F (12%). Before immunization, 65% of the subjects had IgG antibody titers >0.35 ?g/mL for five serotypes tested. Post-vaccination, 100% of the subjects showed titers >1.0 ?g/mL for all PCV7 serotypes with geometric mean concentrations (GMC) ranging from 1.75 ?g/mL (serotype 23F) to 17.16 ?g/mL (serotype 14). Children previously colonized with serotype 6B had a significantly lower GMC to this serotype following immunization than children not carrying 6B prior to the first PCV dose (p<0.05).PCV7 is highly immunogenic in Venezuelan children at high-risk for IPD. Vaccination was associated with an immediate shift in nasopharyngeal carriage toward non-PCV7 serotypes. Finally, we observed serotype-specific hyporesponsiveness to immunization after natural carriage with the same serotype in high-risk children.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837505","annotations":[{"name":"Sickle-cell disease","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.826839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.785844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.646244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.6415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vaccination schedule","weight":0.477122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_schedule"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.217545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.149145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin domain","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"General Medical Council","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Medical_Council"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Venezuela","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Colonialism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"}]}
