{"id":51246,"title":"Risk factors for recurrence of ovarian endometriomas after surgical excision.","abstract":"Ovarian endometrioma is a common form of endometriosis, which may cause infertility, dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain in women of reproductive age. Although surgery is the treatment of choice for endometriomas, recurrence poses a formidable frustration. This study investigated potential risk factors of endometriomas recurrence, aiming to better understand its pathogenesis. A total of 307 patients with endometriomas were followed up for an average of 28.6 months and the 1-, 2- and 3-year cumulative recurrence rate was 9.5%, 21.9%, and 29.2%, respectively. Twenty-one potential risk factors for endometriomas recurrence were evaluated using Cox's proportional hazards models. Total revised American Fertility Society (rAFS) score was significantly associated with higher recurrence (OR=1.858, 95% CI=1.122-3.075, P=0.016), as well as younger age at surgery (OR=0.953, 95% CI=0.915-0.992, P=0.020). Semiradical surgical treatment was defined as surgical removal of cyst plus hysterectomy with preservation of bilateral or unilateral ovary, and was a significant factor that was associated with lower recurrence than the conservative surgery (OR=0.318, 95% CI=0.107-0.951, P=0.040). Postoperative pregnancy was favorable factors for disease recurrence (OR=0.217, 95% CI=0.102-0.460, P=0.000). The results suggest that endometrioma recurrence is inversely associated with age at surgery and postoperative pregnancy, and may correlate with total rAFS score and conservative surgery method.
