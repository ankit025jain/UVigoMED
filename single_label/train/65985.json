{"id":65985,"title":"[Four cases of urinary dysfunction associated with sacral herpes zoster].","abstract":"Herpes zoster is caused by the infection of Varicella-Zoster virus. The anatomical distribution of herpes zoster in the sacral area is only 6. 9%1). Moreover, the onset rate of herpes zoster with urinary dysfunction is 0.6%1). The lesion sites of herpes zoster which cause urinary dysfunction are almost lumber and sacral areas. We describe four cases of sacral herpes zoster with urinary dysfunction in this report. All patients were elderly people (66-84 years old), and all patients were administered anti-virus drugs and alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blockers. Because of urinary retention, three patients have performed clean intermittent self-catheterization (CIC) for several weeks. As the lesions of herpes zoster healed, each patient recovered from urinary dysfunction.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755820","annotations":[{"name":"Herpes zoster","weight":0.839173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_zoster"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Urinary retention","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_retention"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Adrenergic receptor","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.438962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.313159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.215327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Antivirus software","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Blocking (American football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(American_football)"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Lumber","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"}]}
