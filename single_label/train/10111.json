{"id":10111,"title":"[?-amyloid peptide deposition and expression of related miRNAs in the cerebellum of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease].","abstract":"To investigate the presence of ?-amyloid peptide (A?) deposition in the cerebellum and the expression of related miRNAs in the cerebellum of a mouse model of Alzheimer disease.Twelve 12-month-old APPswe/PS?E9 double transgenic mice and 12 wild-type C57 mice were sacrificed and the brain tissues were taken for examination. The right hemisphere was stained with Congo red to observe the deposition of amyloid substances, and from the left hemisphere, the hippocampus and the cerebellum were dissected for detecting the expression of miRNA-135a-5p, miRNA-298-5p, miRNA-466b-3p and miR-669f-3p using real-time PCR.Congo red staining revealed the presence of A? deposition in both the hippocampus and the cerebellum of the transgenic mice but not in the control mice. Real-time PCR showed a significantly lower expression of the 4 miRNAs in the hippocampus in the transgenic mice than in the control mice (P<0.05). The expression of miRNA-135a-5p, miRNA-298-5p, and miR-669f-3p in the cerebellum was significantly lower in the transgenic mice than in the control mice (P<0.05). The expression of miRNA-298-5p and miR-669f-3p in the hippocampus was significantly lower than that in the cerebellum of the transgenic mice (P<0.05).? deposition also occurs in the cerebellum of APPswe/PS?E9 double transgenic mice, and its formation might be related to the down-regulation of miRNA-135a-5p, miRNA-298-5p, and miR-669f-3p.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670442","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.809989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.7721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.712318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.683716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Genetically modified mouse","weight":0.33296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_mouse"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.274684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Cerebral hemisphere","weight":0.228894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Congo red","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_red"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo"},{"name":"Lateralization of brain function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
