{"id":72631,"title":"Added value of shear-wave elastography for evaluation of breast masses detected with screening US imaging.","abstract":"To evaluate the additional value of shear-wave elastography (SWE) to B-mode ultrasonography (US) and to determine an appropriate guideline for the combined assessment of screening US-detected breast masses.This study was conducted with institutional review board approval, and written informed consent was obtained. From March 2010 to February 2012, B-mode US and SWE were performed in 159 US-detected breast masses before biopsy. For each lesion, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category on B-mode US images and the maximum stiffness color and elasticity values on SWE images were assessed. A guideline for adding SWE data to B-mode US was developed with the retrospective cohort to improve diagnostic performance in sensitivity and specificity and was validated in a distinct prospective cohort of 207 women prior to biopsy.Twenty-one of 159 masses in the development cohort and 12 of 207 breast masses in the validation cohort were malignant. In the development cohort, when BI-RADS category 4a masses showing a dark blue color or a maximum elasticity value of 30 kPa or less on SWE images were downgraded to category 3, specificity increased from 9.4% (13 of 138) to 59.4% (82 of 138) and 57.2% (79 of 138) (P < .001), respectively, without loss in sensitivity (100% [21 of 21]). In the validation cohort, specificity increased from 17.4% (34 of 195) to 62.1% (121 of 195) and 53.3% (104 of 195) (P < .001) respectively, without loss in sensitivity (91.7% [11 of 12]).The addition of SWE to B-mode US improved diagnostic performance with increased specificity for screening US-detected breast masses. BI-RADS category 4a masses detected at US screening that showed a dark blue color or a maximum elasticity value of 30 kPa or less on SWE images can be safely followed up instead of performing biopsy.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24955927","annotations":[{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.900826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.74046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.716136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.661523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.652616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.611753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.399831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.359066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"BI-RADS","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BI-RADS"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.296071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Pascal (unit)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Elastography","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastography"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"7-Eleven","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Eleven"},{"name":"Mass (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(music)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Added value","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Added_value"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Report","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"}]}
