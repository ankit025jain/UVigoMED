{"id":84820,"title":"[Case-control study on earlier medial tibial pain after total knee arthroplasty].","abstract":"To compare the difference of anterior knee pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between the ways using periosteal dissector and electric scalpel to release medial collateral ligament and pes anserinus.From September 2009 to September 2012, 220 patients with unilateral osteoarthritis were treated with primary TKA in hospital 301. All the patients were randomly divided into periosteal dissector group (110 cases) or electric scalpel group (110 cases). In the periosteal dissector group, there were 47 males and 63 females,with an average age of (58.8 +/- 17.2) years old; the degree of genuavarus was (14.0 +/- 3.5) degrees; the weight was (65.6 +/- 12.8) kg; the body mass index (BMI) was (26.6 +/- 3.6) kg/m2. In the electric scalpel group,there were 49 males and 61 females,with an average age of (59.6 +/- 16.7) years old;the degree of genuavarus was (15.0 +/- 4.7) degrees; the weight was (66.4 +/- 13.4) kg; the BMI was (27.4 +/- 4.1) kg/m2. The mean follow-up period was 24.6 months. The AKS, VAS and HSS were used to evaluate clinical results.All incisions healed at the first stage;no deep vein thrombosis of lower limbs or pulmonary embolism occurred. Knee infection occurred in 3 cases (1 in the periosteal dissector group and 2 in the electric scalpel group), and the 3 patients received stage 2 total knee revision using antibiotic bone cement and TC3 prosthesis. No recurrence of infection occurred during follow-up. Among the 20 patients who had anterior knee pain, 16 patients were in the periosteal dissector group and 4 patients were in the electric scalpel group. The occurrence rate of anterior knee pain in the electric scalpel group was lower than that in the periosteal dissector group. The AKS knee score and HSS score after total knee arthroplasty in the electric scalpel group were all higher than those in the periosteal dissector group, and the VAS in electric scalpel group was lower than that of periosteal dossector group.Compared with using electric scalpel,using periosteal dissector used to release medial collateral ligament and pes anserinus may cause more anterior knee pain after total knee arthroplasty.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029830","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.723035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.701885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.648831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.626523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.556647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.509766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.483806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Medial collateral ligament","weight":0.382443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.328658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.313345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Periosteum","weight":0.280463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum"},{"name":"Bone cement","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_cement"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.273685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.131926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Scalpel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalpel"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Deep vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein"},{"name":"Knee pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_pain"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
