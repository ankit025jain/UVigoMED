{"id":30891,"title":"Role of receptor interacting protein (RIP)1 on apoptosis-inducing factor-mediated necroptosis during acetaminophen-evoked acute liver failure in mice.","abstract":"Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose induces apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)-dependent necroptosis, but the mechanism remains obscure. The present study investigated the role of receptor interacting protein (RIP)1, a critical mediator of necroptosis, on AIF-dependent necroptosis during APAP-induced acute liver failure. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with APAP (300 mg/kg). As expected, hepatic RIP1 was activated as early as 1 h after APAP, which is earlier than APAP-induced hepatic RIP3 upregulation. APAP-evoked RIP1 activation is associated with hepatic glutathione (GSH) depletion. Either pretreatment or post-treatment with Nec-1, a selective inhibitor of RIP1, significantly alleviated APAP-induced acute liver failure. Moreover, Nec-1 improved the survival and prevented APAP-induced necroptosis, as determined by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Further analysis showed that Nec-1 significantly inhibited APAP-induced hepatic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and mitochondrial Bax translocation. In addition, Nec-1 blocked APAP-induced translocation of AIF from the mitochondria to the nucleus. Of interest, no changes were induced by Nec-1 on hepatic CYP2E1 expression. In addition, Nec-1 had little effect on APAP-induced hepatic GSH depletion at early stage. Taken together, these results suggest that RIP1 is involved in APAP-induced necroptosis. Nec-1 is an effective antidote for APAP-induced acute liver failure.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440347","annotations":[{"name":"CYP2E1","weight":0.90816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.798873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.765589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.679913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Acute liver failure","weight":0.668553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.632495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.593393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.509539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.482862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Antidote","weight":0.327954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidote"},{"name":"C-Jun N-terminal kinases","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Jun_N-terminal_kinases"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.259797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.221041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.154035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"}]}
