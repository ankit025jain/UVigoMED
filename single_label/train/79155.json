{"id":79155,"title":"Can a multisensory teaching approach impart the necessary knowledge, skills, and confidence in final year medical students to manage epistaxis?","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a multisensory teaching approach in imparting the knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage epistaxis in a cohort of fourth year medical students.One hundred and thirty four fourth year medical students were recruited into the study from Aug 2011 to February 2012 in four groups. Students listened to an audio presentation (PODcast) about epistaxis and viewed a video presentation on the technical skills (VODcast). Following this, students completed a 5-minute Individual Readiness Assessment Test (IRAT) to test knowledge accrued from the PODcast and VODcast. Next, students observed a 10-minute expert demonstration of the technical skills on a human cadaver and spent half an hour practicing these techniques on cadaver simulators with expert guidance. The students' confidence was assessed with Confidence Level Questionnaires (CLQs) before and after their laboratory session. The skill level of a subset of students was also assessed with a pre- and post-laboratory Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS).Eighty two percent of the participants achieved a score of at least 80% on the IRAT. The CLQ instrument was validated in the study. There was a statistically significant improvement between the pre- and post-laboratory CLQ scores (p<0.01) and also between pre- and post-laboratory OSATS scores (p<0.01). Qualitative feedback suggested a student preference for this teaching approach.This study provides further evidence that a multisensory teaching intervention effectively imparts the necessary knowledge, skill and confidence in fourth year medical students to manage epistaxis.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479815","annotations":[{"name":"Skill","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.292516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.203665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Epistaxis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistaxis"},{"name":"Video podcast","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_podcast"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Can (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Demonstration (people)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_(people)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Teaching method","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_method"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Learning styles","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles"}]}
