{"id":73655,"title":"Soil amendments that slow cancer growth.","abstract":"The recognition that the tumor microenvironment contributes to tumor survival, growth, and response to therapy provides the rationale for considering it a therapeutic target. The article by Alspach and colleagues in this issue provides evidence that p38MAPK acts posttranscriptionally to promote the tumor-permissive secretory phenotype of both cancer-associated and senescent fibroblasts, and that p38MAPK inhibitors already in clinical trials have significant therapeutic potential.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891361","annotations":[{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Senescence","weight":0.630251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence"},{"name":"Soil","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.268384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.0378012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Soil conditioner","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_conditioner"},{"name":"P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"}]}
