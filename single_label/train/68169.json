{"id":68169,"title":"Immediate administration of tolvaptan prevents the exacerbation of acute kidney injury and improves the mid-term prognosis of patients with severely decompensated acute heart failure.","abstract":"?Tolvaptan, an oral selective vasopressin 2 receptor antagonist that acts on the distal nephrons to cause a loss of electrolyte-free water, is rarely used during the acute phase of acute heart failure (AHF).?We investigated 183 AHF patients admitted to the intensive care unit and administered tolvaptan (7.5mg) with continuous intravenous furosemide, and then additionally at 12-h intervals until HF was compensated. When intravenous furosemide was changed to peroral use, the administration of tolvaptan was stopped. The patients were assigned to tolvaptan (n=52) or conventional treatment (n=131) groups. The amount of intravenous furosemide was significantly lower (35.4 [16.3-56.0] mg vs. 80.0 [30.4-220.0] mg), the urine volume was significantly higher on days 1 and 2 (3,691 [3,109-4,198] ml and 2,953 [2,128-3,592] ml vs. 2,270 [1,535-3,258] ml and 2,129 [1,407-2,906] ml) and the numbers of patients with worsening-AKI (step-up RIFLE Class to I or F) and Class F were significantly fewer (5.8% and 1.9% vs. 19.1% and 16.0%) in the tolvaptan group than in the conventional group, respectively. One of the specific medications indicated worsening-AKI and in-hospital mortality was tolvaptan (odds ratio [OR] 0.155, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.037-0.657 and OR 0.191, 95% CI 0.037-0.985). The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the death rate within 6 months was significantly lower in the tolvaptan group. The same result was found after propensity matching of the data.?Early administration of tolvaptan could prevent exacerbation of AKI and improve the prognosis for AHF patients.?","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Male Urogenital
