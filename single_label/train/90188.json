{"id":90188,"title":"A prospective randomized controlled trial of controlled passive mobilization vs. place and active hold exercises after zone 2 flexor tendon repair.","abstract":"The rehabilitation program after flexor tendon repair of zone II laceration varies. We designed a Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial of controlled passive mobilization (modified Kleinert) vs. Place and active hold exercises after zone 2-flexor tendon repair by two-strand suture (Modified kessler).Sixty-four fingers in 54 patients with zone 2 flexor tendon modified Kessler repairs were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing place and active hold exercises to controlled passive mobilization (modified Kleinert). The primary outcome measure was total active motion eight weeks after repair as measured by an independent and blinded therapist.Patients treated with place and active hold exercises had significantly greater total active motion (146) eight weeks after surgery than patients treated with controlled passive mobilization (114) (modified Klinert). There were no ruptures in either group.Place and hold achieves greater motion than controlled passive mobilization after a two-strand repair for zone 2 flexor tendon repairs.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641742","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.823856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.812099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.487499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.228184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0449418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Hagen Kleinert","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen_Kleinert"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Annular ligaments of fingers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_ligaments_of_fingers"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Hardiness zone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardiness_zone"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
