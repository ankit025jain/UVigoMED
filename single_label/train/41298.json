{"id":41298,"title":"Use of serum levels of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1alpha in chronic hepatitis B.","abstract":"The reasons for the chronic viral persistence of hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) are unknown, but are probably related to host immune factors. Cytokines play a significant role in immune defense. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a proinflammatory cytokine and some studies have demonstrated that IL-1 production was impaired in patients with chronic infections of hepatitis B virus, implying that IL-1 may play a role in viral clearance, progression of fibrosis and in malignant potential of HBV. In this study, along with routine laboratory tests, has been performed the analysis of serum levels of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1alpha in order of better understanding and monitoring of chronic hepatitis B.The aim of this study was to analyze the usefulness of laboratory tests, which are routinely used in the assessment of liver disease with specified immunological parameters in patients with chronic hepatitis B.Total of 60 subjects was divided into two groups: HBV- PCR positive and negative group. The control group of 30 healthy participants was included. Apart from standard laboratory tests, the analysis included serum levels of cytokine IL-1alpha.IL-1alpha had the highest mean concentration in group 1-viral hepatitis C, with PCR positive test (5.73 pg/ml), and then in group 2-viral hepatitis B, PCR negative test (5.39 pg/ml). ANOVA test proves that IL-1alpha in the healthy group (3) was different from other groups as follows: in relation to group 1 statistical significance level was p <0.001 (F = 32 75 5); in relation to group 2 was also statistically significant at p < 0.001 (F = 182 361); Cytokine IL-1 was statistically analyzed separately and compared by group 1 and 2 using Student t-test for independent samples. Statistical significance was observed at p = 0.026. IL-1alpha was positively correlated with the duration of the illness (p < 0.01) and with serum ALT activity (p < 0.01) and serum AST activity (p < 0.01). Using multivariate analysis model \"Factor Analysis\", was made significant stratification predictive parameters in relation to the cytokine IL-1alpha, stratified significance is indicated as follows: 1. Age, 2. history of receiving transfusions, 3. ALT, 4. AST, 5. MELD score (negative), 6. Child-Pugh score (Negative).IL-1alpha was significantly elevated in inflammatory conditions of pronounced activity (PCR positive hepatitis). IL-1alpha may have important role as marker of both inflammation and hepatic injury, particularly in the course of hepatitis B. Results suggest that inflammatory and immune parameters, analyzed together can significantly contribute to the understanding and predicting of chronic liver damage. IL-1 can be used as important parameter of inflammatory activity and fibrosis evaluation and eventually prediction of malignant transformation in chronic liver damage.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Digestive System
