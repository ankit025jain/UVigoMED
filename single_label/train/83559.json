{"id":83559,"title":"Pediatricians' communication about weight with overweight Latino children and their parents.","abstract":"To examine pediatrician weight-management communication with overweight Latino children and their parents and whether communication differs by pediatrician-patient language congruency.Mixed-methods analysis of video-recorded primary care visits with overweight 6- to 12-year-old children. Three independent reviewers used video/transcript data to identify American Academy of Pediatrics-recommended communication content and establish communication themes/subthemes. Language incongruence (LI) was defined as pediatrician limited Spanish proficiency combined with parent limited English proficiency (LEP). Bivariate analyses examined associations of LI with communication content/themes.The mean child age (N = 26) was 9.5 years old; 81% were obese. Sixty-two percent of parents had LEP. Twenty-seven percent of pediatricians were Spanish-proficient. An interpreter was used in 25% of LI visits. Major themes for how pediatricians communicate overweight included BMI, weight, obese, chubby, and no communication (which only occurred in LI visits). The pediatrician communicated child overweight in 81% of visits, a weight-management plan in 50%, a culturally relevant dietary recommendation in 42%, a recommendation for a follow-up visit in 65%, and nutrition referral in 50%. Growth charts were used in 62% of visits but significantly less often in LI (13%) versus language-congruent (83%) visits (P < .001).Many overweight Latino children do not receive direct communication of overweight, culturally sensitive dietary advice, or follow-up visits. LI is associated with a lower likelihood of growth chart use. During primary care visits with overweight Latino children, special attention should be paid to directly communicating child overweight, formulating culturally sensitive weight-management plans, and follow-up. With LEP families, vigilance is needed in providing a trained interpreter and using growth charts.","date":"2014-11-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25311599","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.735704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.658353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.52783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.522269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Spanish language","weight":0.491565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.465711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.383807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.357338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"English as a foreign or second language","weight":0.172335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_foreign_or_second_language"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0845957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0834668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Latitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Independent school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_school"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Vigilante","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilante"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
