{"id":61531,"title":"Germline polymorphisms in RNF31 regulate linear ubiquitination and oncogenic signaling.","abstract":"A new study proposes that the cancerous behavior of B cells in a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is caused by excessive activity of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) complex, which underlies abnormal NF-?B signaling. Two rare germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the RNF31 gene have been identified as being responsible. The use of a small inhibiting peptide may downregulate the abnormal LUBAC activity and counteract neoplastic cell growth.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24706658","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Ubiquitin","weight":0.781434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.708041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.657776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.526962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Vidhan Sabha","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidhan_Sabha"},{"name":"Waco F series","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_F_series"},{"name":"National Film Board of Canada","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Board_of_Canada"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"}]}
