{"id":89529,"title":"Large-scale brain dynamics in disorders of consciousness.","abstract":"Brain injury profoundly affects global brain dynamics, and these changes are manifest in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Despite the heterogeneity of injury mechanisms and the modularity of brain function, there is a commonality of dynamical features that characterize the EEG along the gamut from coma to recovery. After severest injury, EEG activity is concentrated below 1 Hz. In minimally conscious state during wakefulness, there is a peak of activity in the 3-7 Hz range, often coherent across the brain, and often also activity in the beta (15-30 Hz) range. These spectral changes likely result from varying degrees of functional deafferentation at thalamic and cortical levels. EEG-based indices of brain dynamics that go beyond these simple spectral measures may provide further diagnostic information and physiologic insights.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709594","annotations":[{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Minimally conscious state","weight":0.833244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimally_conscious_state"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Thalamus","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalamus"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Brain injury","weight":0.685223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_injury"},{"name":"Wakefulness","weight":0.584836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefulness"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.41452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.379468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.32337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Global brain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_brain"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"1530","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1530"},{"name":"Spectral line","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line"},{"name":"Gamut","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Beta wave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_wave"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Commonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonality"},{"name":"Modularity","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Silver Spring monkeys","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Spring_monkeys"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
