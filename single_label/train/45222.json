{"id":45222,"title":"Impact of sequential proton density fat fraction for quantification of hepatic steatosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","abstract":"To determine the utility of sequential MRI-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) for quantification of the longitudinal changes in liver fat content in individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).A total of 18 consecutive individuals (M/F: 10/8, mean age: 47.7Â±9.8 years) diagnosed with NAFLD, who underwent sequential PDFF calculations for the quantification of hepatic steatosis at two different time points, were included in the study. All patients underwent T1-independent volumetric multi-echo gradient-echo imaging with T2* correction and spectral fat modeling.A close correlation for quantification of hepatic steatosis between the initial MRI-PDFF and liver biopsy was observed (rs=0.758, p<0.001). The median interval between two sequential MRI-PDFF measurements was 184 days. From baseline to the end of the follow-up period, serum GGT level and homeostasis model assessment score were significantly improved (p=0.015, p=0.006, respectively), whereas BMI, serum AST, and ALT levels were slightly decreased. MRI-PDFFs were significantly improved (p=0.004). A good correlation between two sequential MRI-PDFF calculations was observed (rs=0.714, p=0.001). With linear regression analyses, only delta serum ALT levels had a significant effect on delta MRI-PDFF calculations (r2=38.6%, p=0.006). At least 5.9% improvement in MRI-PDFF is needed to achieve a normalized abnormal ALT level. The improvement of MRI-PDFF score was associated with the improvement of biochemical parameters in patients who had improvement in delta MRI-PDFF (p<0.05).MRI-PDFF can be used for the quantification of the longitudinal changes of hepatic steatosis. The changes in serum ALT levels significantly reflected changes in MRI-PDFF in patients with NAFLD.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24694249","annotations":[{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.780751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.726226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.671019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.545423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.537035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.465204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.341472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.337572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.321849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.231451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-glutamyl_transpeptidase"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.160579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"758","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/758"},{"name":"238","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/238"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Midfielder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Fat content of milk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_content_of_milk"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"River delta","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
