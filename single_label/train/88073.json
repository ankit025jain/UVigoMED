{"id":88073,"title":"[Assessment of traumatic rib fractures caused by traffic accident].","abstract":"We reviewed 66 cases of traumatic rib fracture by traffic accident between January 2009 and December 2011. The age of patients ranged from 18 to 88 years, with an average age of 55.6, and they were predominantly male. They met with traffic accident when driving automobiles in 30 cases, driving motorcycles in 15 cases, and walking in 9 cases. The average number of fractured ribs was 4.1Â±3.2.Multiple rib fractures were observed in 75.8% of patients. Injuries other than rib fractures were involved in all patients who suffered over 7 rib fractures. Except one who died of pneumonia 62 days after traffic accident, 7 of 8 patients died within 48 hours:6 in a shock state and 1 in cardiac pulmonary arrest on arrival. About 80 % of the patients with rib fractures were hospitalized. As traffic accidents could cause any type of injuries including rib fractures, it is important to examine the whole body when patients were transported to a hospital.
