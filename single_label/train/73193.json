{"id":73193,"title":"3 Tesla intraoperative MRI for brain tumor surgery.","abstract":"Implementation of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) has been shown to optimize the extent of resection and safety of brain tumor surgery. In addition, iMRI can help account for the phenomenon of brain shift and can help to detect complications earlier than routine postoperative imaging, which can potentially improve patient outcome. The higher signal-to-noise ratio offered by 3 Tesla (T) iMRI compared with lower field strength systems is particularly advantageous. The purpose of this article is to review the imaging protocols, imaging findings, and technical considerations related to 3T iMRI. To maximize efficiency, iMRI sequences can be tailored to particular types of tumors and procedures, including nonenhancing brain tumor surgery, enhancing brain tumor surgery, transsphenoidal pituitary tumor surgery, and laser ablation. Unique imaging findings on iMRI include the presence of surgically induced enhancement, which can be a potential confounder for residual enhancing tumor, and hyperacute hemorrhage, which tends to have intermediate signal on T1-weighted sequences and high signal on T2-weighted sequences due to the presence of oxyhemoglobin. MR compatibility and radiofrequency shielding pose particularly stringent technical constraints at 3T and influence the design and usage of the surgical suite with iMRI.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24921066","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Brain tumor","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.744892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.733921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Magnetic field","weight":0.647214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.412609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.379473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pituitary adenoma","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_adenoma"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Radiation protection","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection"},{"name":"Nikola Tesla","weight":0.105708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.0599054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0335392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"3T","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3T"},{"name":"Laser ablation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_ablation"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Energy conversion efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency"},{"name":"Spin-lattice relaxation time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-lattice_relaxation_time"},{"name":"Sphenoid bone","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Suite","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suite"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
