{"id":55139,"title":"Retrospective evaluation of the influence of pupil size on visual acuity after KAMRA inlay implantation.","abstract":"To investigate the influence of pupil size on visual acuity after KAMRA inlay (AcuFocus, Inc., Irvine, CA) implantation.Five hundred eighty-four presbyopic eyes of 584 patients who underwent LASIK were evaluated. Uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA), uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), and corrected near visual acuity (CNVA) were measured. Two groups were classified: small pupil (pupil diameter < 6 mm) and large pupil (pupil diameter ? 6 mm) for both mesopic (pupil diameter < 4 mm) and photopic (pupil diameter ? 4 mm) pupil size parameters. The follow-up period was 6 months.There were no significant differences in UNVA (P = .98) and CNVA (P = .16) between the mesopic pupil size groups; however, there were significant differences in UDVA (P = .023) and CDVA (P = .039). There was a weak correlation between pupil size and UDVA of the large mesopic pupil size group (rs = 0.129, P = .04). There were no significant differences in UNVA (P = .78), CNVA (P = .92), UDVA (P = .19), and CDVA (P = .60) for the photopic pupil size groups.Pupil size does not have an influence on the resultant visual acuity after KAMRA inlay implantation. No correlation was found between preoperative and postoperative pupil size and visual acuity for the mesopic pupil groups.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24983830","annotations":[{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.692342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.48468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.31749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Presbyopia","weight":0.298882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyopia"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Photopic vision","weight":0.0409614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopic_vision"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Mesopic vision","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopic_vision"},{"name":"Irvine, California","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine,_California"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0221208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"584","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/584"},{"name":"University of California, Irvine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Irvine"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Inlay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inlay"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Euclidean vector","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
