{"id":59218,"title":"The use of a Rusch intrauterine balloon to cause tamponade on a severe hemorrhage in a case of endometrial cancer.","abstract":"Intractable vaginal bleeding is a complication of gynecological tumors of the cervix and endometrium. The management of torrential bleeding usually requires laparotomy or laparoscopy, or less invasive techniques such as uterine artery embolization. This case report describes the use of an intrauterine Rusch balloon catheter, previously only used in the obstetric setting. This is a safe and inexpensive method of management, which does not need specific training. We also review all the current options for the management of severe bleeding as a complication of gynecological cancers.
