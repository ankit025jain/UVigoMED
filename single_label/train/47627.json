{"id":47627,"title":"Histologically proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and clinically related factors in recipients after liver transplantation.","abstract":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects a substantial proportion of the world population, and its prevalence has been increasing. The study was aimed at evaluating the prevalence and peri-transplant risk factors for post-liver transplantation (LT) NAFLD. A retrospective review was performed for adult recipients who underwent late protocol biopsy (>1 yr after LT) between August 2010 and December 2012. Hepatic steatosis was reviewed and graded by hepatopathologists, and the peri-transplant factors were analyzed for relationships to histologically proven NAFLD. Total 166 biopsies had been performed in 156 recipients. NAFLD was present in 27.1% at a mean period of 35.4 months between LT and biopsy, moderate and severe steatosis (?33%) consisted of 28.9%. In multivariate analysis, pre-LT alcoholic cirrhosis (odds ratio [OR] 8.031, p = 0.003), obesity at biopsy (OR 3.873, p = 0.001), and preexisting donor graft steatosis (OR 3.147, p = 0.022) were significant risk factors for post-LT NAFLD. In conclusion, NAFLD represented a considerable portion of recipients, but this prevalence was not higher than those for general population. Three risk factors were significantly related to post-LT NAFLD, and recipients with those factors should be monitored for NAFLD. Furthermore, possible progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or fibrosis and metabolic syndrome should be considered in future studies.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579874","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Steatohepatitis","weight":0.728586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatohepatitis"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.69924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.564199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.343314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.238135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"World population","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"}]}
