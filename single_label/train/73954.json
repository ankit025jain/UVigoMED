{"id":73954,"title":"Evaluation of suitable target antigens and immunoassays for high-accuracy immune monitoring of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus-specific T cells as targets of interest in immunotherapeutic approaches.","abstract":"Adoptive immunotherapy with donor-derived antiviral T cells can prevent viral complications such as with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In this context accurate monitoring of cellular immunity is essential and requires suitable quantitative and qualitative assays for high-throughput screening. We comparatively analyzed 57 HLA-typed healthy donors for memory T-cell responses to CMV- and EBV-derived proteins, peptide pools and single HLA-restricted peptides by five commonly used immunoassays in parallel: enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), cytokine secretion assay (CSA), intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and pMHC multimer staining. T-cell responses varied greatly between the different target antigens in the investigated assays. IFN-? ELISPOT consistently detected the highest T-cell response levels against CMV and EBV. CMV-specific T cells were detected in 100% of CMV-seropositive donors tested using CMVpp65 protein and/or overlapping CMVpp65 peptide pool. CMV-specific T cells in HLA-A*02:01-positive/CMV-seropositive donors were identified directly by HLA-A02/CMVpp65 (A02pp65) multimer staining and, after short in vitro stimulation with HLA-A*02:01-restricted pp65 peptide, by ELISPOT, ELISA, ICS and CSA. A peptide-specific T-cell response was detected in only 4 HLA-A*02:01-positive donors (50%). Despite A02pp65 peptide negativity, T-cell responses to CMVpp65 protein and/or overlapping peptide pool were detected. Comparing the specific immune response against EBV antigens in healthy donors overall, BZLF1-specific T cells (<92.9% peptides, <56.3% peptide pool) were more frequent than EBNA-specific T cells (<64.3% peptides, <46.9% peptide pool) with higher percentage of positive findings for single HLA-restricted EBV peptides. T-cell response against HLA-B*08 peptide epitopes was predominant (multimer staining: EBNA3A: 9/14 and BZLF1: 7/14, IFN-? ELISPOT: EBNA3A: 13/14 and BZLF1: 11/14). The fact that responses to EBV-specific antigens were not detected in every single EBV-seropositive donor as well as that the T-cell frequencies in response to the investigated EBV antigens differed strongly in the donor cohort indicates that these epitopes are less immunodominant than CMVpp65. Taken together, precise monitoring of T-cell immunity against infectious agents in potential T-cell donors and post-transplant recipients requires individual selection of antigens and immunoassays for the efficient detection and generation of clinically relevant T cells. Due to its lower detection limit and direct visualization of each IFN-?-secreting cell we identified ELISPOT analysis to be preferable for high-throughput pre-screening. CSA was found to be advantageous for a more detailed analysis of antigen-specific T-cell subsets.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24877879","annotations":[{"name":"ELISPOT","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISPOT"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Secretion assay","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion_assay"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.78153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell-mediated immunity","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell-mediated_immunity"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.734615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Oligomer","weight":0.718366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligomer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.560266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.498826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.340539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.163635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
