{"id":23992,"title":"A lectin from Spatholobus parviflorus inhibits Aspergillus flavus ?-amylase: enzyme kinetics and thermodynamic studies.","abstract":"Aspergillus flavus is a commonly found fungal pathogen which produces structurally related and highly toxic secondary metabolites, aflatoxins. It has been proposed that ?-amylase inhibitors may limit the ability of the fungus to produce aflatoxins. Hence, this enzyme is a potent target for the development of antifungal agents. In this study, it was found that Spatholobus parviflorus seed lectin (SPL) can inhibit the growth of A. flavus with a MIC value of 1.5 mg/mL. The enzyme kinetics, molecular modeling and isothermal titration calorimetric studies suggest that SPL can inhibit ?-amylase with Ki value of 0.0042 mm. Hence, it is suggested that the antifungal activity of SPL might be partly due to its ability to inhibit the enzyme ?-amylase.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460654","annotations":[{"name":"Aspergillus flavus","weight":0.914325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_flavus"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Amylase","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase"},{"name":"Enzyme kinetics","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_kinetics"},{"name":"Lectin","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectin"},{"name":"Aspergillus","weight":0.801103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.696813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Secondary metabolite","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_metabolite"},{"name":"Aflatoxin","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aflatoxin"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Pathogenic fungi","weight":0.505498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_fungi"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.477876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Latin","weight":0.442407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.430984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Thermodynamics","weight":0.264844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0376635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Calorimetry","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorimetry"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Isothermal process","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isothermal_process"},{"name":"Molecular modelling","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_modelling"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Chemical kinetics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_kinetics"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"}]}
