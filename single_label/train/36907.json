{"id":36907,"title":"Routine measurement of amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase: the need for a reevaluation.","abstract":"The objective of the study was to evaluate whether the current screening regimen of measuring amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AF-AFP) at the time of amniocentesis and reflex acetylcholinesterase testing vs ultrasound alone to detect neural tube and ventral wall defects offers improved diagnostic accuracy and cost benefit.A retrospective chart review on all patients who had amniocentesis performed at 1 center over the past 11 years was performed. Those with an elevated AF-AFP were compared with those whose AF-AFP was within normal limits. Ultrasound findings and outcomes were reviewed in all cases to assess whether neural tube defects (NTDs) or ventral wall defects (VWDs) were missed by AF-AFP or ultrasound screening. A cost-benefit analysis was then performed.Of 6232 women who underwent amniocentesis between January 2002 and December 2012, 81 had an elevated AF-AFP with or without a positive acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Of these 81 women, 13 had NTDs and 5 had VWDs. The sensitivity of the detailed ultrasound was 100% in detecting NTDs and VWDs, whereas that of the AF-AFP ranged from 22% to 77%, with the inclusion of AChE. The total expenditure for AF-AFP in our sample set (n = 6232 amniocentesis at $76.00 per AF-AFP) was $473,632, and all NTDs and VWDs were detected by ultrasound. Translated to a national laboratory (>42,447 samples/year), the cost savings in 2011 alone would be $3,225,972.Given the accuracy of high-resolution ultrasound in the detection of both NTDs and VWDs, measuring AF-AFP and AChE as a reflex-screening test is not a cost-effective approach.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530818","annotations":[{"name":"Amniocentesis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniocentesis"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Alpha-fetoprotein","weight":0.798702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-fetoprotein"},{"name":"Amniotic fluid","weight":0.694494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.657937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.654701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.514478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Neural tube defect","weight":0.446188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube_defect"},{"name":"Neural tube","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube"},{"name":"Acetylcholinesterase","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.11268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"632","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/632"},{"name":"972","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/972"},{"name":"225","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/225"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"Cost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"United States Department of Energy National Laboratories","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy_National_Laboratories"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
