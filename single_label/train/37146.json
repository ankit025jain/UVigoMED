{"id":37146,"title":"Low risk of pulmonary valve implantation after a policy of transatrial repair of tetralogy of Fallot delayed beyond the neonatal period: the Melbourne experience over 25 years.","abstract":"The study sought to evaluate the late outcomes of a policy of transatrial repair delayed beyond the neonatal period.Long-term outcomes of transatrial repair of tetralogy of Fallot are unknown.The records of 675 consecutive patients undergoing a transatrial repair of tetralogy of Fallot between 1980 and 2005 were reviewed, their follow-up updated and survival confirmed from national death registries. One-third (220 of 675) had undergone previous palliation. Median age at repair was 2 years in the first 8 years, and 1 year from 1988 onward. A transannular incision was performed in 75% of cases and autologous pericardium was the material used to patch this incision in 92% of cases.There were 7 hospital deaths (1%). Eight patients died during follow-up (2 sudden unexpected and 6 noncardiac deaths). Mean follow-up was 11.7 ± 6.3 years. Twenty-five years' survival was 97% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 95% to 98%). Twenty-five years' freedom from implantation of a valved conduit was 84.6% (95% CI: 77.8% to 89.5%). By multivariable analysis, prior palliation and younger age at repair were predictive of implantation of a valved conduit (hazard ratio: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3 to 4.6, p = 0.008; hazard ratio: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.96, p = 0.03, respectively).During long-term follow-up, transatrial repair of tetralogy of Fallot was associated with a minimal risk of sudden death and low rate of reintervention for right ventricular dilation and residual outflow tract obstruction.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
