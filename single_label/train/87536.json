{"id":87536,"title":"Classification and reduction manipulation of fractures in Chinese traditional Mongolian osteopathy.","abstract":"To explore the concept of classification and reduction manipulation of fractures in Chinese traditional Mongolian osteopathy.Based on the linear classification of fractures in Chinese traditional Mongolian osteopathy and the practice of reduction manipulation, a dynamic classification and reduction manipulation concept of fractures was established with the use of modern biomechanical principles and methods.We classified the linear classification and reduction manipulation of fractures in Chinese traditional Mongolian osteopathy based on the achievement of fracture line and used the cause of the formation of the fracture line for our dynamic classification and reduction manipulation of fractures concept.The etiology of the formation of fracture lines can be used to decrease diagnostic error, increase therapeutic effects of manipulation, and further provide a new concept and method for the development of the reduction concept of fractures.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102702","annotations":[{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.774857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"China","weight":0.42471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.27219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Mongolian language","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_language"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.051322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Osteopathy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopathy"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Fracture (geology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture_(geology)"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Linear classifier","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_classifier"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"}]}
