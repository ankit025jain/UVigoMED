{"id":92426,"title":"The anteroposterior axis of the tibia in Korean patients undergoing total knee replacement.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to find anatomical landmarks for rotational alignment of the tibial component in total knee replacement (TKR) in a CT-based study. Pre-operative CT scanning was performed on 94 South Korean patients (nine men, 85 women, 188 knees) with osteoarthritis of the knee joint prior to TKR. The tibial anteroposterior (AP) axis was defined as a line perpendicular to the femoral surgical transepicondylar axis and passing through the centre of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). The angles between the defined tibial AP axis and anatomical landmarks at various levels of the tibia were measured. The mean values of the angles between the defined tibial AP axis and the line connecting the anterior border of the proximal third of the tibia to the centre of the PCL was -0.2Â° (-17 to 14.1, sd 4.1). This was very close to the defined tibial axis, and remained so regardless of lower limb alignment and the degree of tibial bowing. Therefore, AP axis defined as described, is a reliable anatomical landmark for rotational alignment of tibial components.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25371461","annotations":[{"name":"Posterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.864194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Lower limb","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_limb"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.706002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.574772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.439469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.25667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.242404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Axis (anatomy)","weight":0.101853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_(anatomy)"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Perpendicular","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular"},{"name":"Associated Press","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Bowing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowing"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
