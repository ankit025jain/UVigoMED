Accurate preoperative evaluation of location of vegetation, cardiac valve pathology is of paramount important. We reported a case of 71-year-old male patient who suffered from pacemaker endocarditis was given suitable surgical treatment under the guidance of real-time three-dimensional trans-esophageal echocardiogram.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885219","annotations":[{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.826996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Artificial pacemaker","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.443331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.23476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.194121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infective endocarditis","weight":0.0694878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infective_endocarditis"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0660354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Vegetation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation"}]}
