{"id":53911,"title":"[Changes in quality of life and related factors in thyroid cancer patients with radioactive iodine remnant ablation].","abstract":"To investigate changes in Quality of life (QOL) and related factors in patients with thyroid cancer undergoing Radioactive Iodine remnant ablation (RAI).Data were collected longitudinally 3 times for 6 months (2 weeks post-surgery, post RAI, 3 months post RAI) in a hospital located in Seoul. Questionnaires were used to measure levels of physical symptoms, anxiety, depression, and QOL. Ninety-eight patients with thyroid cancer who had RAI were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed using SPSS (18.0).Findings for the three data collection times respectfully were: mean scores for physical symptoms, 0.53, 1.21 and 0.62, patients with depression, 47%, 36.7% and 37.7%, patients with anxiety, 18.4%, 19.4% and 20.4%, mean scores for QOL, 7.06, 7.01 and 7.28. QOL score was highest 3 months post RAI (p=.031). In the stepwise multiple regression analysis, depression and fatigue were predicting factors for low QOL at all data collection times. Dysponia was a predicting factor for low QOL post RAI and 3 months post RAI.To increase QOL, it is necessary to provide information in advance regarding physical & psychological symptoms and to develop nursing intervention programs to decrease depression and fatigue.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487996","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.610093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.592681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.512502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.462384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.453623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.432236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.430845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.374405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Iodine-131","weight":0.066941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"RAI","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAI"},{"name":"Seoul","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Steps and skips","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_and_skips"},{"name":"List of bus routes in Westchester County, New York","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_Westchester_County,_New_York"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Test preparation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_preparation"}]}
