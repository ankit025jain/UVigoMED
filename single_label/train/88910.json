{"id":88910,"title":"The World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) underestimates incident and recurrent fractures in consecutive patients with fragility fractures.","abstract":"The World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment tool (FRAX) was developed to identify patients at risk of sustaining a fragility fracture (FF).The objective of the study was to evaluate estimated FRAX probabilities of FF at the time of a FF and to compare them with the observed incidence of recurrent FF.A prospective cohort included men and women older than 50 years at the time of a FF. FRAX scores without bone mineral density [FRAX-body mass index (BMI)] were calculated prior to and after the inclusion FF. Recurrent FFs were recorded over a 4-year follow-up. Determinants associated with recurrent FF were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses.FRAX-BMI scores were available in 1399 of the 1409 recruited patients. A high-risk FRAX-BMI score was present in only 42.7% patients before and 56.4% after the incident FF. Most FF patients at low or moderate risk before their initial FF were men, younger than 65 years, or without previous FF. Over a median follow-up of 3 years, recurrent FF occurred in 108 patients (2.69 per 100 patient-years). The overall sensitivity of post-FF FRAX to predict a recurrent FF was 71.3% and was specifically lower in patients younger than 65 years (13%) and without previous FF (63%) at inclusion.The FRAX-BMI scores were below the Canadian threshold for treatment in more than half the patients at the time of a FF and in close to a third of patients with recurrent FF. FRAX-BMI severely underestimates the FF risk in patients younger than 65 years old and after a single FF.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780062","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.822386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.538188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.471155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.385258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.306619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.296487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.279108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.262983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.254061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.251242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.236268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.200993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Pathologic fracture","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0818325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0526148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"1399","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1399"},{"name":"1409","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1409"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Storm Prediction Center","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Prediction_Center"},{"name":"Inclusion (mineral)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_(mineral)"},{"name":"Recurrent neural network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"World","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"}]}
