{"id":15849,"title":"Bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.","abstract":"The ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. Fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. The frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. Experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. A specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. Much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. The use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25115107","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Enterococcus faecalis","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus_faecalis"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Proteus mirabilis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus_mirabilis"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Enterococcus faecium","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus_faecium"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Bacteriophage","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Lytic cycle","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytic_cycle"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.765546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.719463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pathogenicity","weight":0.578527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenicity"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.569567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.523435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Proteus","weight":0.501388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.383031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.106224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0591548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Extracellular polymeric substance","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_polymeric_substance"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Polystyrene","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"}]}
