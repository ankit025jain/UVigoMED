{"id":45238,"title":"Successful surgical management for duodenum obstruction in a 66 year-old woman previously undiagnosed intestinal malrotation.","abstract":"Intestinal malrotation is a congenital abnormality and is rarely seen in the adulthood. Most adult cases would be classified to the non-rotation type with Ladd's band and Ladd procedure is the treatment of choice. A 66 year-old woman admitted to our hospital due to duodenum obstruction. Several tests revealed that she had intestinal malrotation previously undiagnosed. Operative findings showed the fusion of duodenum with jejunum by the incomplete Treitz ligament. There was no Ladd's band and the right colon was unfixed. Dissection of the fusion completely released her symptom and she discharged without any complication. This is the first report of untypically intestinal malrotation in the adulthood without Ladd's band.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693686","annotations":[{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.619549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.516591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.158384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.154165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Intestinal malrotation","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_malrotation"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Nitrogen fixation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"},{"name":"Ladd, Illinois","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladd,_Illinois"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 66","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_66"}]}
