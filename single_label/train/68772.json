{"id":68772,"title":"Magnetic resonance imaging-guided prostate biopsy: institutional analysis and systematic review.","abstract":"To evaluate the detection rate of prostate cancer (PCa) after magnetic resonance-guided biopsy (MRGB); to monitor the patient cohort with negative MRGB results and to compare our own results with other reports in the current literature.A group of 41 patients was included in this IRB-approved study and subjected to combined MRI and MRGB. MRGB was performed in a closed 1.5?T MR unit and the needle was inserted rectally. The follow-up period ranged between 12 and 62 months (mean 3.1 years). To compare the results with the literature, a systematic literature search was performed. Eighteen publications were evaluated.The cancer-suspicious regions were punctured successfully in all cases. PCa was detected in eleven patients (26.9?%) who were all clinically significant. MRGB showed a benign histology in the remaining 30 patients. In the follow-up (mean 3.1 years) of patients with benign histology, no new PCa was diagnosed. The missed cancer rate during follow-up was 0.0?% in our study.MRGB is effective for the detection of clinically significant cancer, and this is in accordance with the recent literature. In the follow-up of patients with benign histology, no new PCa was discovered. Although the probability of developing PCa after negative MRGB is very low, active surveillance is reasonable.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24497092","annotations":[{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.844339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.787412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.768282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.720992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.717027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.682137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.245686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Prostate biopsy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_biopsy"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.0200714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Computer monitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"5T (gang)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5T_(gang)"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"},{"name":"Institutional analysis","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_analysis"}]}
