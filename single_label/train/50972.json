{"id":50972,"title":"Epicardial adipose tissue in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.","abstract":"There remains conflicting opinions regarding the relationship between the risk of cardiovascular disease and subclinical hypothyroidism (SH), and there are also varying study results. Recent growing evidence suggests that epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) may play a key role in the pathogenesis and development of coronary artery disease. The effects of SH on echocardiographic EAT is not currently known. The aim of this present study was to measure echocardiographic EAT with anthropometric and clinical parameters in patients with SH.The study was designed as a prospective and case-controlled study. Body fat ratio, echocardiographic EAT measurements, body mass index, and the waist circumference of patients were measured for analysis.Epicardial adipose tissue was measured to be 3.83±1.04 mm for patients with SH, while it was measured to be 2.81±0.74 mm in the control group, and there was a significant difference detected between two groups (P<0.001).In the present study significantly increased EAT in patients with SH was detected.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736488","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.861668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.774117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.664956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.548697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.429685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.266487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Epicardial","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicardial"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Thiol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiol"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Waistline (clothing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waistline_(clothing)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
