{"id":38376,"title":"Intermittent or sustained systemic inflammation and the preterm brain.","abstract":"Exposure to perinatal infection and inflammation is associated with an increased risk for neonatal brain damage and developmental disabilities. In this integrated mechanism review, we discuss evidence in support of the contention that the preterm newborn is capable of intermittent or sustained systemic inflammation (ISSI), which appears to contribute more to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants than does shorter duration inflammation.
