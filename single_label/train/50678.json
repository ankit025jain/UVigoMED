{"id":50678,"title":"Unilateral ovarian fibrothecoma with menorrhagia.","abstract":"Ovarian fibrothecoma is a relatively new term that is used to describe an ovarian sex cord stromal tumour that has mixed features of both fibroma and thecoma. The prevalence of ovarian fibrothecoma tumours is very rare and is reported to be about 1.2% of all ovarian tumours. We report a case of a 32-year-old woman who presented with acute menorrhagia with no previous medical, surgical or gynecological history. She was amenorrhic for four years after the insertion of a levonorgestrelreleasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) for contraception. The efficacy and location of LNG-IUS was reflected due to the sudden onset of menorrhagia. On pelvic examination and ultrasound the LNG-IUS could not be visualized and a uterine fibroid was noted. A diagnostic laparoscopy was done to identify the LNG-IUS, which revealed an incidental large ovarian mass on the left ovary. CA-125 level was elevated to 45 kU/L (Normal range <35 kU/L). Total abdominal hysterectomy, left salpingo-oopherectomy and cystectomy were performed. On histopathology, the mass was proven to be an ovarian fibrothecoma. No signs of malignancy were noted on peritoneal fluid cytology. The LNG-IUS was found inside the uterus. Our case is reported on the basis of the rare incidence of ovarian fibrothecoma and the possible effect it may have on the efficacy of LNG-IUS causing menorrhagia.
