{"id":72994,"title":"Cobalt, linac, or other: what is the best solution for radiation therapy in developing countries?","abstract":"The international growth of cancer and lack of available treatment is en route to become a global crisis. With >60% of cancer patients needing radiation therapy at some point during their treatment course, the lack of available facilities and treatment programs worldwide is extremely problematic. The number of deaths from treatable cancers is projected to increase to 11.5 million deaths in 2030 because the international population is aging and growing. In this review, we present how best to answer the need for radiation therapy facilities from a technical standpoint. Specifically, we examine whether cobalt teletherapy machines or megavoltage linear accelerator machines are best equipped to handle the multitudes in need of radiation therapy treatment in the developing world.","date":"2014-06-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24929157","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.783461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Cobalt","weight":0.681076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt"},{"name":"Linear particle accelerator","weight":0.648852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.639747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Particle accelerator","weight":0.302331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator"},{"name":"External beam radiotherapy","weight":0.183691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Megavoltage X-rays","weight":0.047465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megavoltage_X-rays"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"2030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030"},{"name":"Late-2000s recession","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_recession"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"International law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law"}]}
