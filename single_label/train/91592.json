{"id":91592,"title":"[Treatment of senile osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with percutaneous kyphoplasty under local anesthesia].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical outcomes of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in treating senile osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures under local anesthesia.From May 2007 to May 2010,129 patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were treated with PKP under local anesthesia. There were 47 males and 82 females, ranging in age from 61 to 92 years old,with an average of 73.7 years old,including 88 segments of thoracic vertebrae and 101 segments of lumbar vertebrae. Visual analogue scale (VAS),height of vertebral body,Cobb's angle were evaluated before and after operation.Operations were performed successfully in all patients and these patients were followed up from 24 to 60 months with an average of 34.2 months. Preoperative,postoperative two weeks and at final follow-up,VAS score was 7.9+/-2.5,2.8+/-1.8,3.0+/-2.2,respectively;Cobb angle was (28.3+/-13.7)degree, (16.2+/-9.8)degree, (19.1+/-10.3)degree, respectively. There was significant difference between postoperative and preoperative, and between at final follow up and preoperative (P<0.05). The height of vertebral body obtained partial recovery. Bone cement leakage occurred in 23 vertebrae (with proportion of 17.8%) during operation,among one patient with temporary clinical symptom of radiculalgia. All lumbago obtained obviously anesis after operation, 1 case complicated with respiratory depression and recovered after resuscitation; 1 case complicated with intestinal obstruction and improved after treatment, 1 case complicated with fracture separation of vertebral body by bone cement, and 4 cases complicated with fracture of adjacent vertebral body.Percutaneous vertebral kyphoplasty is an effective method for treatment of senile osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures,which can expeditiously relieve pain and effectively recovery height of vertebral body and Cobb angle,it has advantages of minimal invasive. The results of short and mid-term follow-up were satisfactory, long-term follow-up is still needed. Correctly choosing the operative indication and improving surgical technique may avoid complications, especially bone cement leakage which is the most frequent complication.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490529","annotations":[{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.860108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Hypoventilation","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoventilation"},{"name":"Low back pain","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_back_pain"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.80318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.778072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.725677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.725261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.660517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.643615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.597896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.591951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.511326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.459539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Compression fracture","weight":0.452148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_fracture"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.425174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.309433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.30582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Percutaneous vertebroplasty","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_vertebroplasty"},{"name":"Bone cement","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_cement"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
