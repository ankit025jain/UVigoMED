{"id":69134,"title":"[Cosmetics as source of xenoestrogens exposure].","abstract":"The estrogens play important role in the health and disease, therefore environmental contaminants interacting with estrogen receptors and exert similar effects may disrupt functions of endocrine system. Xenoestrogens are present as contaminants virtually everywhere: in water, soil, food and air, exposure to xenoestrogens occurs through household products, however also very often occupational exposures take place. Xenoestrogens exposure may cause problems with fertility; they are also known factors playing a role in estrogen dependent cancer development. Exposure to xenoestrogens is particularly dangerous during 'critical periods' of life, such as intrauterine, or puberty periods. One of the important source of xenoestrogen exposure are cosmetics. In the paper the main groups of xenoestrogenic compounds present in cosmetics such as phatalates, parabens and aluminium are described.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466711","annotations":[{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.823007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Soil","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Aluminium","weight":0.743121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.557294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.20913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.115375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Paraben","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraben"},{"name":"Xenoestrogen","weight":0.0311921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoestrogen"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"}]}
