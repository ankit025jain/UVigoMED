{"id":77139,"title":"Vitamin D in renal transplantation - from biological mechanisms to clinical benefits.","abstract":"Recent developments in our understanding of vitamin D show that it plays a significant role in immunological health, uniquely occupying both an anti-microbial and immunoregulatory niche. Vitamin D deficiency is widespread amongst renal transplant recipients (RTRs), thus providing one patho-mechanism that may influence the achievement of a successful degree of immunosuppression. It may also influence the development of the infectious, cardiovascular and neoplastic complications seen in RTRs. This review examines the biological roles of vitamin D in the immune system of relevance to renal transplantation (RTx) and evaluates whether vitamin D repletion may be relevant in determining immunologically-related clinical outcomes in RTRs, (including graft survival, cardiovascular disease and cancer). While there are plausible biological and epidemiological reasons to undertake vitamin D repletion in RTRs, there are few randomized-controlled trials in this area. Based on the available literature, we cannot at present categorically make the case for routine measurement and repletion of vitamin D in clinical practice but we do suggest that this is an area in urgent need of further randomized controlled level evidence.
