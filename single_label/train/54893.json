{"id":54893,"title":"Accommodation in astigmatic children during visual task performance.","abstract":"To determine the accuracy and stability of accommodation in uncorrected children during visual task performance.Subjects were second- to seventh-grade children from a highly astigmatic population. Measurements of noncycloplegic right eye spherical equivalent (Mnc) were obtained while uncorrected subjects performed three visual tasks at near (40 cm) and distance (2 m). Tasks included reading sentences with stimulus letter size near acuity threshold and an age-appropriate letter size (high task demands) and viewing a video (low task demand). Repeated measures ANOVA assessed the influence of astigmatism, task demand, and accommodative demand on accuracy (mean Mnc) and variability (mean SD of Mnc) of accommodation.For near and distance analyses, respectively, sample size was 321 and 247, mean age was 10.37 (SD 1.77) and 10.30 (SD 1.74) years, mean cycloplegic M was 0.48 (SD 1.10) and 0.79 diopters (D) (SD 1.00), and mean astigmatism was 0.99 (SD 1.15) and 0.75 D (SD 0.96). Poor accommodative accuracy was associated with high astigmatism, low task demand (video viewing), and high accommodative demand. The negative effect of accommodative demand on accuracy increased with increasing astigmatism, with the poorest accommodative accuracy observed in high astigmats (?3.00 D) with high accommodative demand/high hyperopia (1.53 D and 2.05 D of underaccommodation for near and distant stimuli, respectively). Accommodative variability was greatest in high astigmats and was uniformly high across task condition. No/low and moderate astigmats showed higher variability for the video task than the reading tasks.Accuracy of accommodation is reduced in uncorrected children with high astigmatism and high accommodative demand/high hyperopia, but improves with increased visual task demand (reading). High astigmats showed the greatest variability in accommodation.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25103265","annotations":[{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.699962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.612605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Hyperopia","weight":0.437727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperopia"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.365278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.34478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.342095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.311627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.204893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Cycloplegia","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloplegia"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.134985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Accommodation (eye)","weight":0.106802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accommodation_(eye)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.0735104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Repeated measures design","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Letter (paper size)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(paper_size)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"247","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Negative number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Letter (alphabet)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(alphabet)"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"Statistical dispersion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"California's 1st State Senate district","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_1st_State_Senate_district"}]}
