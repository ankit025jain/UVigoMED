{"id":74216,"title":"Changing surgical trends in young patients with early stage breast cancer, 2003 to 2010: a report from the National Cancer Data Base.","abstract":"Young patients with breast cancer represent a unique cohort of patients who often have different treatment plans than older patients. We hypothesized that the rates of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) were significantly higher and those of lumpectomy were significantly lower in young patients compared with older patients and that this trend persists when adjusting for patient, tumor, and facility factors.We used the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) to study 553,593 patients from all ages with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage 0 to II breast tumors, who underwent lumpectomy, unilateral mastectomy, or CPM from 2003 toÂ 2010.Over the entire cohort, lumpectomy rates decreased from 67.7% in 2003 to 66.4% in 2010 in contrast to women 45 years old or less, in whom the lumpectomy rates went from 61.3% in 2003 to 49.4% in 2010. Unilateral mastectomy went from 28.2% to 23.9% and CPM from 4.1% to 9.7% compared with women 45 years old or less, in whom unilateral mastectomy rates went from 29.3% to 26.4% and CPM rates from 9.3% to 26.4%. Age was the most significant factor related to increasing CPM rates: 19.7% of women between 41 and 45 years old underwent CPM vs 5.1% of women between 66 and 70 years old. There was substantial regional variation in surgical procedures for young women: lumpectomy rates were lowest in the West and CPM rates were highest in the Midwest. Multivariate logistic regression showed that women 45 years old or younger compared with women more than 45 years who underwent CPM were more likely to be Caucasian, treated at an academic/research institution, have larger tumors, higher grade, higher stage, and lobular histology.The rate of CPM continues to increase, with one-quarter of younger women undergoing CPM. This trend persists across all patient, tumor, and facility characteristics.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24862886","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.73179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.647654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.593459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.532539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.452244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.373669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.364378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.364358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Lumpectomy","weight":0.341938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpectomy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Midwestern United States","weight":0.207234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"American Joint Committee on Cancer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Joint_Committee_on_Cancer"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.0247819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Midwifery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwifery"},{"name":"553","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/553"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Regional variation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_variation"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Joint committee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_committee"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
