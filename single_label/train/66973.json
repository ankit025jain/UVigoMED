{"id":66973,"title":"Pelvic ultrasound evaluation for benign prostatic hyperplasia: prediction of obstruction.","abstract":"Global improvements in water quality, management of infectious diseases, and other medical therapeutics have resulted in a growing population of healthy aging men. One obligate anatomic consequence of aging for these men is the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with secondary bladder outlet obstruction. Although the voiding symptoms associated with the change in bladder health over time predominantly impact the quality of a man's daily experience, there are also significant medical consequences of BPH that require intervention. It is a challenge to distinguish men who are at risk for these medical consequences from the much larger population of older men with voiding symptoms (lower urinary tract symptoms, LUTS). A variety of national guidelines have been developed to establish a diagnostic paradigm for meeting this challenge, but all suffer from inadequate sensitivity for the early identification of men at risk for permanent bladder injury. It is likely that the application of a thorough pelvic ultrasound designed to identify the pertinent anatomic aspects of both the bladder and prostate will improve the sensitivity of these diagnostic paradigms, with subsequent improvement in the outcomes for men with BPH/LUTS.
