{"id":69144,"title":"Association between kidney function and Framingham global cardiovascular disease risk score: a Chinese longitudinal study.","abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is generally considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) development, but rates in individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) are uncertain. The Framingham global CVD risk score (FRS) equation is a widely accepted tool used to predict CVD risk in the general population. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether an association exists between eGFR and FRS in a Chinese population with no CKD or CVD.A total of 333 participants were divided into three groups based on FRS. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation and CKD-EPI equation for Asians (CKD-EPI-ASIA) were used to measure eGFR.A significant inverse association between eGFR and FRS was confirmed with Pearson correlation coefficients of -0.669, -0.698 (eGFR(CKD-EPI), P<0.01) and -0.658, -0.690 (eGFR(CKD-EPI)-ASIA, P<0.01). This association gradually diminished with progression from the low- to high-risk groups (eGFR(CKD-EPI), r =?-0.615, -0.282, -0.197, P<0.01, P<0.01, P>0.05; similar results according to the CKD-EPI-ASIA equation). In the low- or moderate-risk new-groups, this association became stronger with increased FRS (eGFR(CKD-EPI)-ASIA, r =?-0557, -0.622 or -0.326, -0.329, P<0.01). In contrast to the results from 2008, eGFR was independently associated with FRS following adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (P<0.05).Renal function has multiple influences on predicting CVD risk in various populations. With increasing FRS and decreasing eGFR, it is also independently associated with CVD, even in individuals with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2).","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465883","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.772903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.520228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"China","weight":0.464223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Framingham, Massachusetts","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham,_Massachusetts"},{"name":"Fellow of the Royal Society","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"}]}
