{"id":82125,"title":"An unusual case of four simultaneous eruption cysts in an infant.","abstract":"Eruption cyst is a benign lesion with favorable prognosis that may occur during the primary or permanent dental eruption. The purpose of this paper is to report the case of an infant who presented with multiple eruption cysts (ECs), describe their clinical and histological features, and discuss the treatment performed. The first ECs occurred around the primary mandibular central incisors when the patient was seven months old, which ruptured spontaneously. Ten months later, the patient presented with simultaneous eruption cysts around the primary mandibular and maxillary first molars, making the child very uncomfortable. Radiographically, all the involved molars had two thirds root formation. Two cysts, both on the right side, were surgically removed, and the other two ruptured spontaneously.
