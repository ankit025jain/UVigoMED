{"id":66529,"title":"Treatment of urethral strictures in balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) using circular buccal mucosal meatoplasy: experience of 15 cases.","abstract":"Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) related strictures involving the external urethral meatus. We reviewed our result with the use of circular mucosal graft in the reconstruction of strictures.Between March 1997 and January 2012, 15 patients underwent circular buccal mucosal urethroplasy for BXO related anterior urethral strictures. Urethral catheter was removed within 2 weeks. Follow-up included patient symptoms assessment, cosmetic outcome and uroflowmetry.Median follow-up was 20.5 months (range 4 to 96). Mean postoperative peak urinary flow rate obtained 1 month after catheter removal was 22.4 ml per second. All patients had a normal meatus and none had recurrent stricture, chordee or erectile dysfunction. A functional and cosmetic outcome was achieved in 100% of the patients.Circular mucosal graft technique for treatment of meatal strictures is an efficient method for the restoration of a functional and cosmetic penis.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704927","annotations":[{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Chordee","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordee"},{"name":"Balanitis","weight":0.803965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanitis"},{"name":"Urinary meatus","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_meatus"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Balanitis xerotica obliterans","weight":0.689554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanitis_xerotica_obliterans"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.662155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.656825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.646359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.23342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Erectile tissue","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_tissue"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Urine flow rate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine_flow_rate"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.0245397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
