{"id":88881,"title":"Repair of Achilles tendon ruptures with peroneus brevis tendon augmentation.","abstract":"To report 22 patients who underwent repair of compound Achilles tendon ruptures with peroneus brevis tendon augmentation.Records of 6 women and 19 men aged 21 to 42 (mean, 28) years who underwent repair of compound Achilles tendon ruptures with peroneus brevis tendon augmentation were reviewed. All the wounds were transverse/oblique, minimally contaminated, and could be closed primarily. Patients were evaluated at months 3, 9, and 12, using the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) questionnaire.Of the 22 patients, 3 developed superficial skin complications that healed gradually, and 2 developed a superficial discharging sinus and underwent minor debridement. No patient had a re-rupture of the Achilles tendon. At the one-year follow-up, all patients achieved good functional outcome in terms of the FAOS.Repair of Achilles tendon ruptures with peroneus brevis tendon augmentation achieved good functional outcome.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781614","annotations":[{"name":"Skin","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.322155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Achilles tendon","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.102947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Achilles","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Peroneus brevis","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroneus_brevis"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tendinosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinosis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Adductor brevis muscle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adductor_brevis_muscle"},{"name":"Peroneus muscles","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroneus_muscles"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"}]}
