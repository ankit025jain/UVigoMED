At the same time, 69% of Americans are religious, while 40% attend church regularly. This study evaluated the health benefits of two different biblically-based health promotion programs offered through rural and metropolitan churches with varying resources. Participants in both programs experienced weight loss and positive health changes, supporting that churches can be an effective way to promote health in America.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25004732","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.755309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Religion","weight":0.473076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.464762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.385295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.143477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Health promotion","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_promotion"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Church (building)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_(building)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Metropolitan area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area"}]}
