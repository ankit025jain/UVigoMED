{"id":69585,"title":"Piperlongumine promotes autophagy via inhibition of Akt/mTOR signalling and mediates cancer cell death.","abstract":"The Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway serves as a critical regulator of cellular growth, proliferation and survival. Akt aberrant activation has been implicated in carcinogenesis and anticancer therapy resistance. Piperlongumine (PL), a natural alkaloid present in the fruit of the Long pepper, is known to exhibit notable anticancer effects. Here we investigate the impact of PL on Akt/mTOR signalling.We examined Akt/mTOR signalling in cancer cells of various origins including prostate, kidney and breast after PL treatment. Furthermore, cell viability after concomitant treatment with PL and the autophagy inhibitor, Chloroquine (CQ) was assessed. We then examined the efficacy of in vivo combination treatment using a mouse xenograft tumour model.We demonstrate for the first time that PL effectively inhibits phosphorylation of Akt target proteins in all tested cells. Furthermore, the downregulation of Akt downstream signalling resulted in decrease of mTORC1 activity and autophagy stimulation. Using the autophagy inhibitor, CQ, the level of PL-induced cellular death was significantly increased. Moreover, concomitant treatment with PL and CQ demonstrated notable antitumour effect in a xenograft mouse model.Our data provide novel therapeutic opportunities to mediate cancer cellular death using PL. As such, PL may afford a novel paradigm for both prevention and treatment of malignancy.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434432","annotations":[{"name":"Alkaloid","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaloid"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.890718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.863479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.838443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.798635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.711112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.668902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.644593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.616811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.560846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.437795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Chloroquine","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroquine"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.309526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.139479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0691456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Chili pepper","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
