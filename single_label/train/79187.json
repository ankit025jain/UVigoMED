{"id":79187,"title":"Comparative assessment between objective and subjective methods in slides stained by immunohistochemistry.","abstract":"Objective methods of assessment are often required in scientific studies. Histological tests with immunohistochemical staining can be assessed by photometry.To compare this objective method with the subjective evaluation performed by three independent examiners, using slides of acquired middle ear cholesteatomas.We selected a total of 54 cholesteatoma images, immunohistochemically stained by anti-TNF-R2 (32 slides) and anti-TGF-?, (22 slides). The secondary antibody used in the two groups was the Max Polymer Detection System (Novo Link Kit, NovocastraÂ®, UK). The samples were processed by a digital slide scanner (ScanScope - Aperio). The selected sites were analyzed by photometry.The objective assessment by photometry was compared with the subjective evaluation by three examiners and subjected to statistical analysis. The Statistical analysis revealed moderate reproducibility (K values between 0.41 and 0.60) for both groups.Our study showed that the irregular characteristics of middle ear cholesteatoma slides stained by immunohistochemistry prevents its proper objective evaluation, while the subjective assessment by experienced examiners was more reliable.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474481","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.693902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.516713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.403169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.388047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0375437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Cholesteatoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesteatoma"},{"name":"Photometry (optics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(optics)"},{"name":"Primary and secondary antibodies","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_and_secondary_antibodies"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Link (The Legend of Zelda)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)"},{"name":"Independent school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_school"},{"name":"Codec listening test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec_listening_test"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Comparative politics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_politics"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
