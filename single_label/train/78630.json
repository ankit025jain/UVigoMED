{"id":78630,"title":"Catgut implantation at acupoints for allergic rhinitis: a systematic review.","abstract":"To assess the effectiveness and the possible adverse effects of catgut implantation at acupoints for allergic rhinitis (AR).This systematic review was carried out in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook version 5.1.0 and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Extensive literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Excerpta Medical Databases, the Cochrane Library, the China National Infrastructure, Wanfang Chinese Digital Periodical and Conference Database, and the Weipu Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database. The Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Center was also searched for ongoing trials up to September 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs were included. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias.Five RCTs with 285 participants were found from 49 relevant studies, but there was just one RCT which met the inclusion criteria for this review. The study showed that treatment of catgut implantation at acupoints could lead to a better alleviation of the signs and symptoms of AR than the crude herb moxibustion. No adverse events were reported in this study.Because of the methodological shortcoming and the risk of bias of the included trial, catgut implantation was proved with only limited evidence for the treatment of AR. Robust RCTs with high quality and larger sample size in this field are hoped to be carried out in the future.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615216","annotations":[{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.784194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.667606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"China","weight":0.632976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.49927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.43468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.377511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Moxibustion","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxibustion"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.293613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.206567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Infrastructure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Catgut","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catgut"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Academic journal","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Robust statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Periodical literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodical_literature"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
