{"id":10052,"title":"Ganglioside deficiency causes inflammation and neurodegeneration via the activation of complement system in the spinal cord.","abstract":"Gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, are highly expressed in nervous systems of vertebrates and have been considered to be involved in the development, differentiation, and function of nervous tissues. Recent studies with gene-engineered animals have revealed that they play roles in the maintenance and repair of nervous tissues. In particular, knockout (KO) mice of various ganglioside synthase genes have exhibited progressive neurodegeneration with aging. However, neurological disorders and pathological changes in the spinal cord of these KO mice have not been reported to date. Therefore, we examined neurodegeneration in double knockout (DKO) mice of ganglioside GM2/GD2 synthase (B4GANLT1) and GD3 synthase (ST8SIA1) genes to clarify roles of gangliosides in the spinal cord.Motor neuron function was examined by gait analysis, and sensory function was analyzed by von Frey test. Pathological changes were analyzed by staining tissue sections with Kl√ºver-Barrera staining and by immunohistochemistry with F4/80 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Gene expression profiles were examined by using DNA micro-array of RNAs from the spinal cord of mice. Triple knockout mice were generated by mating DKO and complement component 3 (C3)-KO mice. Gene expression of the complement system and cytokines was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as a function of age.DKO mice showed progressive deterioration with aging. Correspondingly, they exhibited shrunk spinal cord, reduced thickness of spinal lamina II and III, and reduced neuronal numbers in spinal lamina IX, spinal lamina II, and spinal lamina I. Complement-related genes were upregulated in DKO spinal cord. Moreover, complement activation and inflammatory reactions were detected by GFAP-active astrocyte, microglial accumulation, and increased inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF?) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1?). Triple knockout mice showed restoration of reduced neuron numbers in the spinal cord of DKO mice, getting close to levels of wild-type mice.Disruption in the architecture of lipid rafts in the spinal cord was not so prominent, suggesting that mechanisms distinct from those reported might be involved in the complement activation in the spinal cord of DKO mice. Gene profiling revealed that inflammation and neurodegeneration in the spinal cord of DKO mice are, at least partly, dependent on complement activation.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Animal
