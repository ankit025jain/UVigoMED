{"id":20373,"title":"Growth and HIV-free survival of HIV-exposed infants in Malawi: a randomized trial of two complementary feeding interventions in the context of maternal antiretroviral therapy.","abstract":"To compare the growth of HIV-exposed children receiving 1 of 2 complementary foods after prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission through maternal lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART).In rural Malawi, 280 HIV-infected pregnant women were consecutively identified and offered ART, without consideration of their CD4 counts. Mothers were supported to exclusively breast-feed and children tested for HIV status at 1.5 and 5.5 months of age. From this group, 248 HIV-exposed children were enrolled and randomized to receive micronutrients with either whole milk powder or a ready-to-use complementary food (RUF), until the child reached 12 months of age. Children were followed until 18 months of age.HIV-free survival at 12 months was 90% (95% confidence interval: 87% to 94%). Exclusive breast-feeding for the first 6 months of life was practiced in 97% of the children. At 12 months of age, 89% of the children continued to be breast-fed. At 6 months of age, infants had a weight-for-height z score of 0.7 ± 1.1 (mean ± SD) and length-for-age z score of -1.3 ± 1.2. The decrease in length-for-age z score among children receiving RUF at 12 months of age was greater than that seen in those receiving milk powder (-0.3 ± 0.8 vs -0.1 ± 0.7, P = 0.04). Mean weight-for-height z score was >0 at 12 and 18 months of age in both groups.HIV-free survival ?90% at 12 months was achieved with maternal ART while either milk powder or RUF as a complementary food preserved child anthropometry. Breast-feeding by mothers receiving ART was acceptable.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24662296","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Malawi","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.748739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.631221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.544634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Micronutrient","weight":0.53111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronutrient"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.299983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Powdered milk","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powdered_milk"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Z","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z"},{"name":"248","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/248"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Powder (substance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(substance)"},{"name":"Exclusive (album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_(album)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Revolutionary United Front","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_United_Front"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
