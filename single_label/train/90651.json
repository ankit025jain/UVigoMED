{"id":90651,"title":"The current practices of speech-language pathologists in providing information to clients with traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"The provision of information about cognitive-communication disorders (CCDs) following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is important given the impact these communication impairments can have on the rehabilitation of people with TBI. This study describes the results of an online survey which investigated the current practices of 74 Australian speech-language pathologists (SLPs) working with adults with TBI. Thirty-seven SLPs outlined their practices in information provision. SLPs reported they provide information to adults with TBI about CCDs, the impact of CCDs on participation in life activities, and rehabilitation from CCDs. In addition, SLPs identified barriers and facilitators to information provision. Barriers identified included time, impairments resulting from TBI, and personal characteristics of the client. Facilitators included family functioning and support and the multidisciplinary team. Findings of this research indicate a need for some changes in the format and content of information that SLPs provide to adults with TBI, to ensure they can achieve fundamental levels of health literacy and better health outcomes.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24588453","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Literacy","weight":0.615993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.529441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.528812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.468153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.198984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.140999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.134085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Australians","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health literacy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_literacy"},{"name":"Radio format","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_format"},{"name":"Paid survey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_survey"},{"name":"Charge-coupled device","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Barriers","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barriers"}]}
