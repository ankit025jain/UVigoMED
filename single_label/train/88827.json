{"id":88827,"title":"Comprehensive history and physical examination of the throwing shoulder.","abstract":"The shoulder is subject to tremendous stress during the throwing motion, which creates the opportunity for injury and disability. Understanding the potential causes of injury in the overhead athlete can be challenging in and of itself; however, placing those diagnoses in the clinical context of an injured athlete can be even more challenging. In a world of advancing technology and increasing dependence on magnetic resonance imaging, the art of history taking and physical examination can be easily forgotten.
