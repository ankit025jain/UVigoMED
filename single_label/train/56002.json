{"id":56002,"title":"Serial biomechanical comparison of edematous, normal, and collagen crosslinked human donor corneas using optical coherence elastography.","abstract":"To noninvasively evaluate the effects of corneal hydration and collagen crosslinking (CXL) on the mechanical behavior of the cornea.Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.Experimental study.An optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique was used to measure the displacement behavior of 5 pairs of debrided human donor globes in 3 serial states as follows: edematous, normal thickness, and after riboflavin-ultraviolet-A-mediated CXL. During micromotor-controlled axial displacements with a curved goniolens at physiologic intraocular pressure (IOP), serial optical coherence tomography scans were obtained to allow high-resolution intrastromal speckle tracking and displacement measurements over the central 4.0 mm of the cornea.With no imposed increase in IOP, the mean lateral to imposed axial displacement ratios were 0.035 ?m/?m ± 0.037 (SD) in edematous corneas, 0.021 ± 0.02 ?m/?m in normal thickness corneas, and 0.014 ± 0.009 ?m/?m in post-CXL corneas. The differences were statistically significant (P<.05, analysis of variance) and indicated a 40% increase in lateral stromal resistance with deturgescence and a further 33% mean increase in relative stiffness with CXL.Serial perturbations of the corneal hydration state and CXL had significant effects on corneal biomechanical behavior. With an axially applied stress from a nonapplanating contact lens, displacements along the direction of the collagen lamellae were 2 orders of magnitude lower than axial deformations. These experiments show the ability of OCE to quantify clinically relevant mechanical property differences under physiologic conditions.Proprietary or commercial disclosures are listed after the
