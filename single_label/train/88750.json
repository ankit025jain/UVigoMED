{"id":88750,"title":"Team models in neurorehabilitation: structure, function, and culture change.","abstract":"Neurorehabilitation requires a team effort. Over time the nature of teams has evolved from single discipline work through multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary teams to trans-disciplinary teams. However, there are inconsistencies in the literature and clinical practice as to the structure and function of these team models. Each model engenders advantages over its predecessor and unless the models are well understood clinicians may labor in a model that is less efficacious than the most transcendent model.To define and examine the models of single discipline care, multi-disciplinary teams, inter-disciplinary teams, and trans-disciplinary teams and to review in depth trans-disciplinary teams as the most advanced team model. This paper will also consider professional roles and integration across disciplines as well as the crucial topics of staff selection, attendance in rounds and the nature of rounds, staff physical plant assignments, and leadership responsibilities. Leadership responsibilities that will be addressed include scope of practice and role release, peer pressure, and culture change issues.The trans-disciplinary model is the gold standard for teams in neurorehabilitation because they entail more integrated service delivery than do other teams. Trans-disciplinary teams also represent a more persons-centered approach. To initiate a trans-disciplinary model, team members must have excellent communication and shared decision making including persons with brain injury. Leadership must address staff selection, scope of practice and role-release. Otherwise, the model will fail due to peer pressure and institutional or program cultural variables.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796442","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.74597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.617754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.605897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Discipline","weight":0.587259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Leadership","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership"},{"name":"Labour economics","weight":0.422042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.327891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.294684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.267722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Transdisciplinarity","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0388964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Transcendence (religion)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_(religion)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Peer pressure","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0177991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
