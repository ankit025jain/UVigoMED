{"id":52990,"title":"Sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes, pharmacological treatments and indicators of care in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes: Analyses on administrative database.","abstract":"The impact of diabetes on cardiovascular disease in both sexes is known, but the specifics have not been fully clarified. We investigated whether sex-related differences exist in terms of management and hospitalization in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes.We examined the rates of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes, mortality, treatments and management of patients with diabetes compared to subjects without, from administrative database. Interaction between sex and diabetes on clinical outcomes were calculated using a Cox regression model. Pharmacological treatments and recommended examinations by sex were calculated using logistic regression.From 2002 to 2006, 158,426 patients with diabetes and 314,115 subjects without were identified and followed up for a mean of 33 months (Â± 17.5). Diabetes confers a higher risk for all clinical outcomes. Females with diabetes have a risk profile for hospitalization for coronary heart disease comparable to males without (4.6% and 5.3%). Interaction between sex and diabetes shows that females with diabetes had an added 19% higher risk of total death (95% CI 1.13-1.24). No differences were observed in hospitalizations, although females with diabetes were less likely to undergo revascularization after myocardial infarction. Females received cardiovascular prevention drugs less frequently than males and had a slight tendency to get fewer examinations.Diabetes is linked to a higher increase of mortality in females relative to males. This might reflect sex differences in the use of revascularization procedures or therapeutic regimens. Closer attention and implementation of standard care for females are necessary from the onset of diabetes.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556165","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.631971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.411873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.373874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.347521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.345252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.214423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Cardiac marker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_marker"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Sexual dimorphism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
