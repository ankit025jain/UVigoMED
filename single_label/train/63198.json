{"id":63198,"title":"Lymphomatoid granulomatosis: a practical review for pathologists dealing with this rare pulmonary lymphoproliferative process.","abstract":"Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) is a rare B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder predominantly involving the lungs, but poorly-recognized among clinicians and pathologists. It is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven disease mimicking several other diseases on clinical and radiological grounds, generally showing multiple, bilateral nodular, ill-defined infiltrates of the lungs tending to coalescence and/or cavitation. LYG often affects middle-aged males with an underlying immunodeficiency and commonly involves skin and central nervous system during disease progression. Diagnosis requires a generous biopsy and careful histologic examination with immunohistochemical staining and molecular demonstration of EBV genome in large atypical B-cells. LYG is graded as I to III based on the number of large EBV-positive B-cells; grades II/III are now considered as a peculiar variant of T-cell rich diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In this brief review, clinical, radiologic and pathologic features of LYG will be analyzed with focus on differential diagnosis, the most appropriate treatment and prognosis.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466760","annotations":[{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymphoproliferative disorders","weight":0.79151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoproliferative_disorders"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.730262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.677114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.665967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymphomatoid granulomatosis","weight":0.532034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphomatoid_granulomatosis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.485979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.362482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Cavitation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation"},{"name":"Symmetry in biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
