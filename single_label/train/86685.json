{"id":86685,"title":"RNA sequencing identifies novel markers of non-small cell lung cancer.","abstract":"The development of reliable gene expression profiling technology increasingly impacts our understanding of lung cancer biology. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to compare the transcriptomes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and normal lung tissues and to investigate expression in lung cancer tissues.We enrolled 88 male patients (mean age, 61.2 years) with NSCLC. RNA-Seq was performed on 88 pairs of NSCLC tumor tissue and non-tumor tissue from 54 patients with adenocarcinoma and 34 patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed to validate differential candidate gene expression in a different NSCLC group.RNA-Seq produced 25.41 × 10(6) (± 8.90 × 10(6)) reads in NSCLC tissues and 24.70×10(6) (± 4.70 × 10(6)) reads in normal lung tissues [mean (± standard deviation)]. Among the genes expressed in both tissues, 335 were upregulated and 728 were downregulated ? 2-fold (p < 0.001). Four upregulated genes - CBX3, GJB2, CRABP2, and DSP - not previously reported in lung cancer were studied further. Their altered expression was verified by immunohistochemistry in a different set of NSCLC tissues (n = 154). CBX3 was positive in 90.3% (139 cases) of the samples; GJB2, in 22.7% (35 cases); CRABP2, in 72.1% (111 cases); and DSP, in 17.5% (27 cases). The positive rate of CRABP2 was higher in adenocarcinoma than squamous cell carcinoma (p < 0.01).CBX3 and CRABP2 expression was markedly increased in lung cancer tissues and especially CRABP2 may be promising candidate genes in lung adenocarcinoma.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751108","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.627403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Candidate gene","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_gene"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.488645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.348417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.323346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.243501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"CBX3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBX3"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
