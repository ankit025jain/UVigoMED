{"id":37342,"title":"Correlations between the presence of sigmoid interventricular septum and increased relapse risk of stroke in hypertensive patients.","abstract":"Comparison between cerebrovascular accident (CVA) relapse in hypertensive patients with sigmoid interventricular septum (SIS) and CVA relapse in hypertensive patients without SIS.We selected 36 hypertensive patients, all of them complicated with previous CVA; 18 patients had SIS (Group A) and 18 patients didn't have SIS (Group B). The utilized methods were the following: clinical examination, electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiogram, biochemical findings and complete blood count, performed every 3 months, during 2 years of observation. Another method, addressed for CVA relapse patients, were cerebral computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging .The recommended treatment was administered according to the European therapeutic guidelines.6 (out of 18) patients with SIS presented a CVA relapse and only 1 (out of 18) patient without SIS revealed a CVA relapse.Our results support recent conclusions from another publications: patients with SIS (an apparently benign condition, which is a part of the cardiac modifications usually discovered in elderly people) have a higher cardiovascular risk for acute events, than the patients without SIS.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502061","annotations":[{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.907611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.807432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.624152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.619792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.120317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Transthoracic echocardiogram","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthoracic_echocardiogram"},{"name":"Secret Intelligence Service","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}]}
