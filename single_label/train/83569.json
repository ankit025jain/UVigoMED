{"id":83569,"title":"Induction of microtubule damage in Allium cepa meristematic cells by pharmaceutical formulations of thiabendazole and griseofulvin.","abstract":"Microtubules (MT) are formed by the assembly of ?- and ?-tubulins and MT-associated proteins. We characterized the effects of pharmaceutical formulations containing the microtubule disruptors thiabendazole (TBZ) and griseofulvin (GF) on the mitotic machinery of plant (A. cepa) meristematic cells. GF concentrations between 10 and 250 ?g/ml were tested. GF induced mitotic index inhibition and genotoxic effects, including chromosome fragments, bridges, lagged chromosomes, C-metaphases, tripolar cell division, disorganized anaphases and nuclear abnormalities in interphase cells. Efects on the mitotic machinery were studied by direct immunofluorescence with ?-tubulin labeling and by DNA counterstaining with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Exposure of meristematic root cells to TBZ or GF, 100 ?g/ml, caused microtubular damage which led to abnormal MT arrays. Our results suggest that GF induces abnormalities in spindle symmetry/polarity, while TBZ causes chromosome missegregation, polyploidy, and lack of cytokinesis.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308540","annotations":[{"name":"DAPI","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAPI"},{"name":"Polyploid","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid"},{"name":"Microtubule","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule"},{"name":"Cytokinesis","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokinesis"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.866004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Interphase","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interphase"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Tubulin","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubulin"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Griseofulvin","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griseofulvin"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Spindle apparatus","weight":0.753898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_apparatus"},{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.709922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.636922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.296948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Meristem","weight":0.234165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meristem"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Phylum","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum"},{"name":"Genotoxicity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotoxicity"},{"name":"Mitotic index","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitotic_index"},{"name":"Onion","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Allium","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium"}]}
