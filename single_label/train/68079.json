{"id":68079,"title":"[Evolution of lower urinary tract symptoms under silodosin: factors influencing patients' satisfaction].","abstract":"The objective of this study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of silodosin in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in current urologic practice.This was a prospective observational study conducted by 272 urologists on patients treated by silodosin for BPH. The parameters evaluated were the weighted IPSS score, the IPSS question 8 related to quality of life, the USP score and the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) measured at treatment initiation and after 3 months.Nine hundred and fourteen patients whose average age was 66 years with LUTS for 3.3 years were analyzed. After 3 months of treatment, a significant decrease in IPSS (from 16.2 ± 6.1 to 9.7 ± 5.5, P<0.0001) and USP score (from 10.6 ± 5.1 to 6 0 ± 4.6, P<0.0001) were observed, quality of life (from 67.1% to 14.4% of unsatisfied patients, P<0.0001) and sleep were significantly improved (from 49.2% to 28.9% patients with insomnia, P<0.0001). Among the patients, 21.2% experienced at least one adverse event. The most frequent were abnormal ejaculation (17.2%). And 7.1% discontinued the treatment for this reason. After 3 months of treatment silodosin was continued in 86.9% of patients.This large study confirmed the efficacy of silodosin in LUTS associated with BPH with a safety profile that does not affect patient satisfaction.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560210","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.823007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Ejaculation","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculation"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.764428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.594769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.491594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Silodosin","weight":0.204051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silodosin"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"Athens","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"1 myriametre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_myriametre"},{"name":"272","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/272"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"United States Pharmacopeia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Pharmacopeia"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"}]}
