{"id":10362,"title":"Death induced by CD95 or CD95 ligand elimination.","abstract":"CD95 (Fas/APO-1), when bound by its cognate ligand CD95L, induces cells to die by apoptosis. We now show that elimination of CD95 or CD95L results in a form of cell death that is independent of caspase-8, RIPK1/MLKL, and p53, is not inhibited by Bcl-xL expression, and preferentially affects cancer cells. All tumors that formed in mouse models of low-grade serous ovarian cancer or chemically induced liver cancer with tissue-specific deletion of CD95 still expressed CD95, suggesting that cancer cannot form in the absence of CD95. Death induced by CD95R/L elimination (DICE) is characterized by an increase in cell size, production of mitochondrial ROS, and DNA damage. It resembles a necrotic form of mitotic catastrophe. No single drug was found to completely block this form of cell death, and it could also not be blocked by the knockdown of a single gene, making it a promising way to kill cancer cells.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656822","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.79342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.737922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Fas receptor","weight":0.732203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fas_receptor"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.713516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.674706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.646359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.615997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.610969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.499981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.487905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.385833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.330282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.15545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Cognate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Cell size","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_size"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
