{"id":45666,"title":"Diagnostic performance of positron emission tomography/computed tomography using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose in detecting locoregional nodal involvement in patients with anal canal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"The diagnostic performance of positron emission tomography using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) in detecting nodal involvement in patients with anal canal cancer (ACC) has been investigated by several studies with conflicting results. The aim of our study is to systematically review and meta-analyze published data about this topic.A comprehensive computer literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases was carried out on July 10 to find relevant articles concerning the diagnostic performance of FDG-PET in detecting locoregional nodal involvement in patients with ACC. No language restriction was used. Pooled diagnostic performance on a lesion-based analysis was calculated.Seven retrospective and five prospective studies have been reviewed. Six studies allowed assessing pooled sensitivity; five studies allowed assessing pooled specificity. Sensitivity and specificity values of FDG-PET/CT on a lesion-based analysis ranged from 31 to 100% and from 53 to 98%, with pooled estimates of 56% (95% CI: 45-67%) and 90% (95% CI: 86-93%), respectively.Our meta-analysis demonstrates that FDG-PET is a specific diagnostic tool in detecting locoregional lymph node involvement in patients with ACC. Low sensitivity is a major concern; however, higher sensitivity could be reached combining FDG-PET with MR scan.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672298","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.869607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.800099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Fluorine","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.406078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.31338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Scopus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus"},{"name":"Anal canal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_canal"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"July 10","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_10"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Topic (linguistics)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Atlantic Coast Conference","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference"}]}
