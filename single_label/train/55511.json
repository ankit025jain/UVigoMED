{"id":55511,"title":"Management of residual refractive error after cataract surgery.","abstract":"To provide a review of the recent literature on the management of residual refractive error after cataract surgery.Laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is the most accurate procedure to correct residual refractive error after cataract surgery. Lens-based procedures, such as intraocular lens (IOL) exchange or piggyback lens implantation, are also possible alternatives in cases with extreme ametropia, corneal abnormalities, or in situations where excimer laser is not available. In this review, we found that Piggyback IOL were safer and more accurate than IOL exchange.Emmetropia is our main target today in modern cataract surgery. Accurate biometric analysis, selection and calculation of the adequate IOL, and modern techniques for cataract surgery all help surgeons to move toward the goal of cataract surgery as a refractive procedure free from refractive error. However, in spite of all these inputs, residual refractive error still occasionally occurs after cataract surgery and LASIK seems to be the most accurate method for its correction.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24865171","annotations":[{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Excimer laser","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer_laser"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Keratomileusis","weight":0.824929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratomileusis"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.794864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.761112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.659278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Excimer","weight":0.517784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.47269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Calculator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"}]}
