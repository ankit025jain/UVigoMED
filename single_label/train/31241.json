{"id":31241,"title":"Safety risks for patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease after acute exposure to selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and COX-2 inhibitors: Meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials.","abstract":"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause bronchospasm in susceptible patients with asthma, often termed aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), with the risk being greatest after acute exposure. Selective NSAIDs that preferentially inhibit COX-2 might be safer.We sought to systematically evaluate changes in symptoms and pulmonary function after acute selective NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor exposure in patients with the AERD phenotype.A systematic review of databases was performed to identify all blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating acute selective NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor exposure in patients with AERD. Effect estimates for changes in respiratory function and symptoms were pooled by using fixed-effects meta-analysis, with heterogeneity investigated.No significant difference in respiratory symptoms (risk difference, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.01; P = .57), decrease in FEV1 of 20% or greater (RD, 0.00; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.02; P = .77), or nasal symptoms (RD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.02; P = .42) occurred with COX-2 inhibitors (eg, celecoxib). Selective NSAID exposure caused respiratory symptoms in approximately 1 in 13 patients with AERD (RD, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.14; P = .01). No significant differences were found according to leukotriene antagonist exposure or whether NSAIDs were randomly allocated.According to clinical trial evidence in patients with stable mild-to-moderate asthma with AERD, acute exposure to COX-2 inhibitors is safe, and selective NSAIDs exhibit a small risk. Thus COX-2 inhibitors could be used in patients with AERD or in patients with general asthma unwilling to risk nonselective NSAID exposure when oral challenge tests are unavailable.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24388008","annotations":[{"name":"Leukotriene","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukotriene"},{"name":"Bronchospasm","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchospasm"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.858148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Celecoxib","weight":0.829934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celecoxib"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.814343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.810785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.783832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.747654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Leukotriene antagonist","weight":0.657597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukotriene_antagonist"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.631481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.274917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Dietitian","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
