{"id":14367,"title":"Novel oral anti-influenza prodrug candidate AV5075S.","abstract":"Development of a novel drug candidate with improved activity against influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) compared with currently available therapeutics.Synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Three-dimensional molecular docking was successfully applied to classify compounds within the series by inhibitory potency. Stability was investigated in blood samples and in animal models. A pharmacokinetic study was performed in dogs and rats using peroral and intravenous administration.A novel highly potent drug candidate [(3R,4R,5S)-4-(2,2-difluoroacetylamino)-5-amino-3-(1-ethyl-propoxy)-cyclohex-1-enecarboxylic acid; AV5027] and its prodrug ethyl ester (AV5075S) were synthesized and tested. AV5027 and AV5075S exhibit picomolar activity against influenza virus NA. AV5075S inhibited NA in a model of pneumonia using mouse-adapted A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) virus significantly more strongly than oseltamivir phosphate. A general metabolic pathway was constructed for the parent compound based on experimental results and theoretical analyses.AV5075S can be reasonably regarded as a novel 'next in class' oral drug candidate for the treatment of influenza.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Animal
