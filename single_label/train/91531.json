{"id":91531,"title":"Migrating sternal rod: ultrasound identification of an unusual soft tissue foreign body.","abstract":"Sternal hardware migration from its original site of implantation is a rare entity. Bedside ultrasound may identify migrated hardware if the site of migration is the subcutaneous tissue.This case report will discuss the unusual phenomenon of migrating sternal hardware, as well as the ultrasonographic characteristics of soft tissue foreign bodies.A 51-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with a 2-month history of intermittent lower abdominal pain, 11 months status post bilateral lung transplant surgery. His examination was remarkable for a palpable mass over the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Initial bedside ultrasound identified a soft tissue foreign body in the subcutaneous tissue overlying the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Further evaluation using plain radiography and computed tomography ultimately diagnosed the foreign body as a metal rod, which had migrated from his sternum. The sternal rod was removed at the bedside, and he was discharged the next day without any complications.Sternal hardware migration is uncommon, but in patients who have undergone surgery involving sternal fixation, this diagnosis should be considered as a cause for unusual symptoms.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495939","annotations":[{"name":"Human sternum","weight":0.836891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sternum"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Lung transplantation","weight":0.67283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_transplantation"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0791456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Bilateral symmetry","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_symmetry"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
