{"id":18712,"title":"Melioidosis :an emerging infection in India.","abstract":"Melioidosis caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei is endemic in Southeast Asia but may be under-diagnosed and under-reported in the Indian subcontinent. This study was undertaken to analyse the clinical presentation and epidemiological risk factors for melioidosis in India.We carried out a retrospective study of 32 culture proven cases of melioidosis at a tertiary care hospital in South India between 2005 and 2010.Thirty two culture confirmed cases of melioidosis were included in the study. Patient age varied from 4 to 60 years with a median age of 42.5 years. Males constituted 75% of cases and 78.12% of cases were from rural areas. Three-fourth (24 of 32) had at least one risk factor that predisposed to melioidosis: diabetes (43.75%) followed by alcoholism (21.87%) were the commonest. Fever was the most common symptom (68.75%) and mean duration of symptoms was 2.34 months before diagnosis. More than half of the cases (56.25%) presented as disseminated disease with the remainder having localised disease, usually septic arthritis or abscesses. Three fourth of patients (75%) were treated successfully on follow-up, with a regimen of parenteral ceftazidime followed by oral doxycycline and cotrimoxazole.Melioidosis is an emerging infection in India especially in males from rural areas, with diabetes and alcoholism being the commonest risk factors. Both sepsis with bacteraemia and localised disease involving joints or focal abscess were common presentations. Diagnosis is readily made by culturing the organism from appropriate clinical specimens and identifying non-fermenting Gram negative bacteria to the species level. As there was an excellent response in 75% of patients, early suspicion, culture confirmation and therapy is warranted in India.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
