{"id":53302,"title":"Papase as a treatment option for the overgranulating wound.","abstract":"Overgranulation (also commonly known as hypergranulation) is a common problem in chronic wound management. We describe a case involving a 57-year-old lady with a chronic diabetic foot ulcer, complicated with overgranulation for the past year. She was administered with various treatments, including hydrocortisone 1% cream and hydrofiber, which proved ineffective and further delayed the healing process of her ulcer. We then decided to use crushed Papase tablets applied to her ulcer after a normal saline dressing and prior to an application of secondary dressing. The patient was instructed clearly on the dressing technique to be performed daily at home and was monitored weekly in a foot care clinic. The overgranulation resolved within 5 weeks and the patient continues recieving care to promote epithelialisation.
