{"id":70967,"title":"[Sequence analysis of a novel allele HLA-C*01:78].","abstract":"To investigate the genetic basis for a novel allele HLA-C*01:78.Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using a QIAGEN quick DNA extraction kit. The regions encompassing HLA-C from exon 1 to intron 3 and intron 3 to 3'UTR were amplified and cloned using a cloning sequencing kit in order to split the two alleles apart. Selected clones were sequenced to include exons 2 to 4.Sequencing results have indicated the HLA-C alleles of the proband to be a novel C*03:04 allele. The sequence has been submitted to GenBank (KF049216). BLAST analysis has confirmed the novel allele to have one nucleotide difference as C*01:03 at genomic nt316C>A (codon 82CGC>AGC) in exon 2, which has resulted in replacement of one amino acid (82R>S).The novel allele has been officially named as C*01:78 by the WHO Nomenclature Committee. The HLA allele type of the proband was therefore A*02:07, 24:02; B*40:01, 46:01; C*01:78, 03:04; DQB1*05:02, 05:02; DRB1*16:02, 16:02.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25119924","annotations":[{"name":"Proband","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proband"},{"name":"Intron","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron"},{"name":"GenBank","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GenBank"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"BLAST","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAST"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.69103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.443838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.37894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.341444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Nomenclature","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"DNA extraction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
