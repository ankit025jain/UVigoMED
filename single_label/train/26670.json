{"id":26670,"title":"Resident cardiac stem cells and their role in stem cell therapies for myocardial repair.","abstract":"Despite advances in treatment, heart failure remains one of the top killers in Canada. This recognition motivated a new research focus to harness the fundamental repair properties of the human heart. Since then, cardiac stem cells (CSCs) have emerged as a promising cell candidate to regenerate damaged hearts. The rationale of this approach is simple with ex vivo amplification of CSCs from clinical-grade biopsies, followed by delivery to areas of injury, where they engraft and regenerate the heart. In this review we will summarize recent advances and discuss future developments in CSC-mediated cardiac repair to treat the growing number of Canadians living with and dying from heart failure.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092406","annotations":[{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.641068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Stem cell treatments","weight":0.638002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_treatments"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.578211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.457647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.271555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.134085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Human heart","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_heart"},{"name":"Residency (medicine)","weight":0.0537278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Cell therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy"}]}
