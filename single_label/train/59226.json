{"id":59226,"title":"Post-operative hemorrhage after myomectomy: safety and efficacy of transcatheter uterine artery embolization.","abstract":"To evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of transcatheter uterine artery embolization (UAE) for post-myomectomy hemorrhage.We identified eight female patients (age ranged from 29 to 51 years and with a median age of 37) in two regional hospitals who suffered from post-myomectomy hemorrhage requiring UAE during the time period from 2004 to 2012. A retrospective review of the patients' clinical data, uterine artery angiographic findings, embolization details, and clinical outcomes was conducted.The pelvic angiography findings were as follows: hypervascular staining without bleeding focus (n = 5); active contrast extravasation from the uterine artery (n = 2); and pseudoaneurysm in the uterus (n = 1). Gelatin sponge particle was used in bilateral uterine arteries of all eight patients, acting as an empirical or therapeutic embolization agent for the various angiographic findings. N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate was administered to the target bleeding uterine arteries in the two patients with active contrast extravasation. Technical and clinical success were achieved in all patients (100%) with bleeding cessation and no further related surgical intervention or embolization procedure was required for hemorrhage control. Uterine artery dissection occurred in one patient as a minor complication. Normal menstrual cycles were restored in all patients.Uterine artery embolization is a safe, minimally invasive, and effective management option for controlling post-myomectomy hemorrhage without the need for hysterectomy.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843240","annotations":[{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.790158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.635174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.497027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.320387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.259241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"United Arab Emirates","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates"},{"name":"Uterine artery embolization","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_artery_embolization"},{"name":"In utero","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_utero"},{"name":"Gelatin","weight":0.0964716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Cyanoacrylate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate"},{"name":"Sponge","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Uterine myomectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_myomectomy"},{"name":"Uterine artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_artery"},{"name":"Extravasation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravasation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Actor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
