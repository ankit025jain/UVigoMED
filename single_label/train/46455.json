{"id":46455,"title":"Olive oil and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids suppress intestinal polyp growth by modulating the apoptotic process in ApcMin/+ mice.","abstract":"The promotion and progression of carcinogenesis are susceptible to nutritional interventions aimed at counteracting cancer development. Lipid metabolism is essential in the onset and progression of tumors and for cancer cell survival. In this study, we tested the effects of diets enriched with natural compounds, such as olive oil and salmon oil, in mice that spontaneously develop intestinal polyps (Apc(Min/+) mice). For this purpose, we evaluated polyp number and volume, intestinal mucosa proliferation/apoptosis, estrogen receptors (ERs) expression, fatty acid synthase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase gene expression and enzymatic activity. Compared with the standard diet, the salmon oil-enriched diet, containing a high percentage of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and, to a lesser extent, olive oil-enriched diet reduced polyp number and volume through a reduction of proliferation and a marked proapoptotic effect. These biological effects were mediated by an inhibition of fatty acid synthase and HMGCoA reductase gene expression and activity and an increase of ER?/ER? ratio. Our findings suggest that a proper dietary lifestyle could contribute to primary cancer prevention.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Digestive System
