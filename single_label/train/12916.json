{"id":12916,"title":"HIF-1? and HIF-2? are critically involved in hypoxia-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes through reducing PGC-1?-mediated fatty acid ?-oxidation.","abstract":"During periods of cellular hypoxia, hepatocytes adapt to consume less oxygen by shifting energy production from mitochondrial fatty acid ?-oxidation to glycolysis. One of the earliest responses to pathologic hypoxia is the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). In the present study, we examined whether HIF-1 and HIF-2 were involved in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis and ?-oxidation. We showed that hypoxia induced fat accumulation in the livers of mice and in HepG2 cells. These hypoxia-induced changes in fatty acid metabolism were mediated by suppressing fatty acid ?-oxidation, without significantly influencing fatty acid synthesis. Exposing hepatocytes to 1% O2 reduced the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the mitochondrial import of fatty acids for ?-oxidation. Moreover, hypoxia exposure reduced proliferator-activated receptor-? coactivator-1? (PGC-1?) protein levels, which plays an important role in regulation of ?-oxidation. Exposure of HIF-1? or HIF-2? deficient hepatocytes to hypoxia abrogated the reduction in PGC-1? and CPT-1 expression and cellular lipid accumulation observed in normal hepatocytes exposed to hypoxia. These results suggest that both HIF-1? and HIF-2? are involved in hypoxia-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes via reducing PGC-1? mediated fatty acid ?-oxidation.
