{"id":53335,"title":"Multivisceral and extended resections during pancreatoduodenectomy increase morbidity and mortality.","abstract":"Improvements in outcomes after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) have permitted more complex resections. Complete extirpation at PD may require multivisceral resection (MVR-PD); however, descriptions of morbidity of MVR-PD are limited to small, single-institution series.The National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database (2005-2011) was used to compare 30-day postoperative morbidity of PD with MVR-PD. Concurrent resection of colon, small bowel, stomach, kidney, or adrenal gland defined MVR-PD.Of 9,927 PDs, MVR-PD was performed in 273 patients (3%). MVR included colon (58%), small bowel (30%), and gastric (12%) resections. Preoperative comorbidities were similar between groups. Pancreatic, duodenal, or periampullary cancer was present in 75% of patients. Mortality (8.8% vs 2.9%) and major morbidity (56.8% vs 30.8%) were much greater for MVR-PD versus PD alone (P < .001). MVR-PD patients also experienced greater rates of wound, pulmonary, cardiac, thromboembolic, renal, and septic complications. On multivariable regression, MVR was an independent predictor of death (odds ratio [OR], 3.4; P < .001), overall morbidity (OR, 3.01; P < .001), major morbidity (OR, 3.21; P < .001), and minor morbidity (OR, 1.65; P = .03). Among patients undergoing PD+MVR, colectomy was an independent predictor of increased overall morbidity (OR, 1.96; P = .03) and major morbidity (OR, 1.90; P = .02).Margin-negative resection may require MVRs at the time of PD. MVR at is associated with 3-fold mortality and substantial morbidity after adjusting for comorbidities. Colectomy independently predicted major morbidity. At PD, the morbidity of MVR should be approached with caution when attempting margin-negative resection.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524390","annotations":[{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.784954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.784752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Embolectomy","weight":0.779022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolectomy"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.76877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Ampulla of Vater","weight":0.200755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampulla_of_Vater"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.155994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"}]}
