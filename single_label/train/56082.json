{"id":56082,"title":"Results of intravitreal ranibizumab with a prn regimen in the treatment of extrafoveal and juxtafoveal neovascular membranes in age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab with a \"pro re nata\" regimen in the treatment of nonsubfoveal neovascular membranes secondary to age-related macular degeneration.Retrospective noncomparative case series. Thirty-one eyes with naive nonsubfoveal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration were consecutively enrolled and treated with ranibizumab intravitreal injections according to a pro re nata regimen. The follow-up was performed monthly up to 6 months and quarterly up to 2 years (25 patients). Early treatment diabetic retinopathy study best-corrected visual acuity and lesion size analysis with fluorescein angiography were recorded.The mean baseline early treatment diabetic retinopathy study best-corrected visual acuity worsened from 20/40 (0.28 logMAR) at baseline to 20/50 (0.42 logMAR) at 1-year follow-up and 20/60 (0.53 logMAR) at 2-year follow-up. The mean lesions size nearly doubled from baseline at the 2-year follow up (1.19-2.47 mm). Twenty-two patients had one or more recurrences at 1-year follow-up. All 25 patients developed a recurrence at 2 years with 7 cases developing a recurrence by 12 months. Twelve cases progressed to subfoveal lesions by the 24-month visit.Other regimens described in the literature might result in a more the satisfactory outcome using more frequent follow-up and more frequent intravitreal injections.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756034","annotations":[{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.880562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.694083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.615348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.222811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.220123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.162826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.144841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Magazine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Reference counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting"},{"name":"2040","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2040"},{"name":"2060s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2060s"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"2050","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2050"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Vasi-vari language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasi-vari_language"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
