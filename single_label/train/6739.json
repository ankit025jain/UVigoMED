{"id":6739,"title":"Mouse models of heart failure: cell signaling and cell survival.","abstract":"Heart failure is one of the paramount global causes of morbidity and mortality. Despite this pandemic need, the available clinical counter-measures have not altered substantially in recent decades, most notably in the context of pharmacological interventions. Cell death plays a causal role in heart failure, and its inhibition poses a promising approach that has not been thoroughly explored. In previous approaches to target discovery, clinical failures have reflected a deficiency in mechanistic understanding, and in some instances, failure to systematically translate laboratory findings toward the clinic. Here, we review diverse mouse models of heart failure, with an emphasis on those that identify potential targets for pharmacological inhibition of cell death, and on how their translation into effective therapies might be improved in the future.
