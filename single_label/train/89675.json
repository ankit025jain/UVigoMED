{"id":89675,"title":"[Effectiveness of arthroscopic bipolar radiofrequency energy for lateral meniscus tear and cartilage injury].","abstract":"To investigate the effectiveness of arthroscopic bipolar radiofrequency energy (bRFE) and lateral partial meniscectomy for lateral meniscus tear and cartilage lesion.Between January 2011 and December 2012, 40 eligible patients with lateral meniscus tear and cartilage injury in the lateral knee compartment underwent arthroscopic treatment, and the clinical data were analysed retrospectively. There were 21 males and 19 females, aged 15-65 years (mean, 42.1 years). The left knee was involved in 22 cases and the right knee in 18 cases. The causes of injury included sport injuries in 5 cases and sprain of knee joints in 8 cases, the remaining patients had no history of trauma. The disease duration ranged from 1 month to 10 years (median, 10 months). The Lysholm score and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score of the knee were 59.9 +/- 8.2 and 69.6 +/- 5.3. According to the Outerbridge classification, 2 cases were rated as grade I, 21 cases as grade II, 17 cases as grade III, and 10 cases as grade IV. The scores described by Noyes were 1-16 (mean, 6.52). The Noyes scores were from 1 to 6 points in 20 patients (group A) and 7 to 16 points in 20 patients (group B). During surgery, all patients underwent partial meniscectomy, and radiofrequency-based chondroplasty was used. Knee joint function was assessed using the Lysholm score and JOA score of the knee, and the clinical outcomes between different degrees of cartilage lesions.were also compared.All incisions healed primarily without complication. All the patients were followed up 8-31 months (mean, 18.1 months). The Lysholm and JOA scores of the knee at last follow-up ( 92.2 +/- 7.2 and 92.9 +/- 7.9, respectively) were significantly higher than those at preoperation (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in preoperative Lysholm and JOA scores of the knee between groups A and B (P > 0.05), but significance difference was found between 2 groups at last follow-up (P < 0.05).Arthroscopic bRFE and lateral partial meniscectomy have good effectiveness in treating lateral meniscus tear and cartilage lesion. The effectiveness is better in patients with mild cartilage lesion than in patients with severe cartilage lesion.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Wounds and
