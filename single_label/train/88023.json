{"id":88023,"title":"Stability of severely stiff elbows after complete open release: treatment by ligament repair with suture anchors and hinged external fixator.","abstract":"Instability is a crucial issue in severe post-traumatic elbow stiffness during complete-release surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ligament repair using a suture anchor in the operative treatment of severely stiff elbows for which a hinged external fixator was indicated.We retrospectively reviewed 46 cases of severely stiff elbows (flexion arc <60°) undergoing open release. During the operation, all 46 elbows were noted to have instability. Suture anchors were applied to restore the ligament if it was impossible to repair the ligament directly, and a hinged external fixator was simultaneously applied to protect the vulnerable ligament and facilitate rehabilitation. No allograft or autograft was used in any of our cases. The stability, arc of motion, Mayo Elbow Performance Score, ulnar nerve symptoms, and radiographs were evaluated.At a mean follow-up of 24.3 months, the postoperative Mayo Elbow Performance Score was 91 points, as compared with 63 points preoperatively. The mean flexion arc improved from 25° to 126°. Three patients presented with moderate elbow instability when the hinged external fixator was removed; however, all of them regained stability by the last follow-up. Furthermore, 7 cases of new-onset nerve palsy were noted; however, all of them resolved with conservative management. None of the patients required secondary surgery for any reason.Repair of an avulsed collateral ligament with suture anchors and hinged external fixation was effective in restoring functional mobility in patients with severe post-traumatic elbow stiffness after complete release. This could be an option for treating ankylosed, severely or very severely stiff elbows.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24927881","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.823761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.694753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Ulnar nerve","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.481475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.475314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Ankylosis","weight":0.422038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosis"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Avulsion injury","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_injury"},{"name":"Anchor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Fixation (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(psychology)"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Collateral (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Mayo GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
