{"id":19440,"title":"Multiplex viral polymerase chain reaction testing using the FilmArray device compared with direct fluorescent antibody testing.","abstract":"Advances in fluidics, electronics, and instrument design have enabled automation of complex molecular assays. The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) is one such assay; it allows for rapid detection of multiple viral and bacterial respiratory targets via nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with all components contained within a single pouch. We performed a detailed comparison of workflow between the FilmArray RP and direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining. The FilmArray RP proved to be more efficient, with as few as 91 total touches needed and as little as 4 minutes 52 seconds hands-on time. This compares with as many as 502 total touches and 12 minutes 45 seconds hands-on time for DFA staining. FilmArray RP detected a greater number of organisms (20 viruses and bacteria vs 7 viruses for DFA staining) and required less training compared with DFA staining. The ease of use of the FilmArray RP makes this molecular assay amenable to operation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in routine laboratory and point-of-care settings.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719989","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.6987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.668233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"RNA polymerase","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.602769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.586326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.471683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.248503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Multiplexing","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Fluidics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluidics"},{"name":"Nested polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Direct fluorescent antibody","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_fluorescent_antibody"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"502","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/502"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Amenable group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenable_group"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Usability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability"},{"name":"24/7","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24/7"},{"name":"Workflow","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow"},{"name":"DFA Records","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA_Records"}]}
