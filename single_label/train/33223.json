{"id":33223,"title":"Carbon dioxide laser perforation and extirpation of steatocystoma multiplex.","abstract":"Steatocystoma multiplex (SM) is a rare condition that presents as multiple dermal cysts, the appearance of which can have a significant impact on the patients' quality of life. Treatment options for SM are limited to surgical excision.To present our experience of treating 8 SM cases using a novel approach that uses the carbon dioxide (CO2) laser and to explore patients' views about the treatment.Patients were identified from our records. All patients had multiple lesions treated using the CO2 laser in the super pulse mode that punctured the cyst. This was followed by extirpating the cyst wall and its contents using a small Volkmann's spoon. Treatment efficacy was assessed clinically and feedback from the patients was sought through a telephone interview.All patients showed significant clinical improvement with minimal scarring and low recurrence rates. High levels of patient satisfaction, which helped to significantly improve their quality of life, were reported with the CO2 laser treatment.CO2 laser perforation and extirpation is a successful approach for managing SM that results in high patient satisfaction.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852470","annotations":[{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide laser","weight":0.757668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_laser"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.682669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.635036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.599309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.558619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.378888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.335266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.276982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.215948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Laser surgery","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_surgery"},{"name":"Steatocystoma multiplex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatocystoma_multiplex"},{"name":"Extinction","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Spoon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Master of Science","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science"}]}
