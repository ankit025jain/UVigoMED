{"id":79341,"title":"The use of a laser-level paralleling device for the fabrication of a unilateral auricular prosthesis.","abstract":"This article describes the use of a laser-level paralleling device for the fabrication of a unilateral auricular prosthesis. Traditional methods require use of calipers to obtain orientation of contralateral auricular anatomy, which in turn can be difficult to replicate on the patient. The purpose of this clinical report is to describe a simple means to record unilateral auricular anatomy.
