{"id":66105,"title":"Tension-free vaginal tape, transobturator tape, and own modification of transobturator tape in the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence: comparative analysis.","abstract":"This study is a comparative evaluation of the TVT, TOT, and our own modification of TOT (mTOT) in the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence from a single center experience.The study was conducted on 527 patients with SUI diagnosed on the basis of urodynamic studies. They were divided into three groups--TVT: n=142, (TOT): n=129, and mTOT: n=256. All of the patients underwent evaluation at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery. Results were statistically analysed and compared.Objective and subjective effectiveness after the surgery were not significantly different in the study groups and ranged from 90.1% to 96.4%. Mean surgery time was 32.3, 28.2, and 26.4 in the TVT, TOT, and mTOT, respectively. Mean hospitalization time was 2.51 days. Mean catheter maintenance time was significantly higher in the TVT than in other groups. In the TVT group total incidence of complications was 13.4%, and it was significantly higher than that in TOT and mTOT (9.3% and 8.6%, resp.).TVT, TOT, and mTOT are highly effective and safe methods in the treatment of SUI. There are no differences in the efficacy between the methods with a little higher percentage of complications in the TVT group.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745013","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.634561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.531201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.528889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.466363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.440941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.24551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Urodynamic testing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urodynamic_testing"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"527","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/527"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Videotape","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"TVT Records","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVT_Records"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"TOT S.C.","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOT_S.C."},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
