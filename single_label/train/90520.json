{"id":90520,"title":"[Application of internal fixation for injuries of pelvic anterior ring through minimally invasive ilioinguinal approach].","abstract":"To evaluate the reliability of limited open reduction and minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) for injuries of pelvic anterior ring and to explore its operative techniques and therapeutic efficacy.From March 2009 to March 2012,20 patients with injuries of pelvic anterior ring were surgically fixed with reconstructive plates through minimally invasive ilioinguinal approach. There were 13 males and 7 females with an average age of 41.6 years ranging from 25 to 61 years. According to classification of Tile, there were 5 cases of type A2, 2 cases of type B1, 9 cases of type B2, 1 case of type B3, 3 cases of type C1. Including 15 cases with anterior ring fracture, 2 cases with anterior ring fracture combined with pubic symphysis separation, and 3 cases with anterior and posterior fractures. Operation time, intra-operative blood losing, injuries of femoral nerve and iliac blood vessels, condition of fracture reduction were observed.All wounds healed at one stage. No complications such as infection or deep venous thrombosis occurred. According to Matta criterion of fracture reduction, 12 cases got excellent results, 7 good, 1 fair. Eighteen patients were followed up from 6 to 32 months with a mean of 16.3 months. According to functional score of Majeed, 15 cases obtained excellent results and 3 good,with an average score of 94.3 +/- 6.0.The modified ilioinguinal approach has advantage of short operation time, less blood losing,minimally invasive in treating injuries of pelvic anterior ring and can obtain satisfactory outcomes.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Wounds and
