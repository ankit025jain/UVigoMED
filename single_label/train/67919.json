{"id":67919,"title":"Quality of life of 1276 elderly patients with prostate cancer, starting treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist: results of a French observational study.","abstract":"This French observational, longitudinal, prospective study described the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of elderly men (?75 years old) with prostate cancer after initiating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy. At baseline and 3-6 months after baseline, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire-core 30 (QLQ-C30) and prostate-specific (QLQ-PR25) questionnaires were completed by patients. Data from 1276 patients were analyzed. At baseline, mean (±SD) age was 80 (±4.1) years, 29.1% of patients had Gleason scores ?8 and 24.9% had metastases. At baseline, increasing age, presence of metastasis and presence of comorbidity had a negative impact on QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 scores. At follow-up, improvement in emotional-functioning (2.8; p?<?0.001), social-functioning (1.7; p?=?0.011), global HRQoL (1.6; p?=?0.029), sleep-disturbance (-2.1; p?=?0.011), appetite-loss (-4.0; p?<?0.001) and pain (-4.1; p?<?0.001) QLQ-C30 scores were observed. In addition, there was a worsening in treatment-related symptom (8.6; p?<?0.001), sexual-activity (-5.5; p?<?0.001) and sexual-functioning (-22.6; p?<?0.001) QLQ-PR25 scores, and an improvement in urinary symptoms (-3.7; p?<?0.001) and incontinence aid (-2.9; p?=?0.023) QLQ-PR25 scores. This study shows that, apart from the expected impact on sexual functioning domains, HRQoL is not adversely affected by 3-6 months of GnRH agonist therapy in older men with prostate cancer.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576298","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.712788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.690329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.576586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.518355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"EORTC","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EORTC"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist","weight":0.339644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone_agonist"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.334964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.222269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"France","weight":0.0315222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Sexual attraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_attraction"}]}
