{"id":64842,"title":"[Chronobiological approach to the treatment of patients with erectile dysfunction using a combination of local negative pressure and laser illumination].","abstract":"It is shown that the synchronization of energetic, spectral, frequency, and temporal parameters of technique with biorhythms of physiological processes in the organ, which is target of impact, and in the human body as a whole, allows to significantly improve efficiency, and achieve stable and reproducible results of treatment. The article presents the results of study including 62 patients with vasculogenic ED. The study design included the randomization of patients into 3 groups depending on the complex of the therapy with the use of combined techniques, including negative pressure and laser illumination (LLNP) as a part of combined therapy and as monotherapy. Significant increase in the peak flow velocity after a course of treatment was observed in all three groups of patients. Improvement in erectile function was observed in all groups; according to IIEF score, erectile function has increased by 22.3 +/- 0.05% in group 1, by 34 +/- 1.5% in the group 2, and by 19 +/- 1.7% in the group 3, indicating the best results of treatment in the group receiving combined therapy. Combination of LLNP with the administration of PDE5 inhibitors significantly increases the effectiveness of treatment of vasculogenic ED due to the influence of physical factors on the stabilization of hemodynamics in the main arteries of the penis. After a course of therapy, increase in systemic vascular elasticity by 39.8 +/- 1.5% was also noted. The efficiency of the LLNP methodology in the treatment of patients with vasculogenic ED is demonstrated. The best results were obtained in the group of patients treated with combined therapy, including the use of LLNP and PDE-5 inhibitor.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Male Urogenital
