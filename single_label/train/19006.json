{"id":19006,"title":"Risk factors for periprosthetic joint infection after total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty in Chinese patients.","abstract":"The purpose of this hospital-based case-control study was to evaluate the risk factors for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) of total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in Chinese patients.From January 2000 to December 2012, 45 patients undergoing THA and TKA who developed PJI were recruited for case subjects; controls were 252 without PJI, matched by year of index for surgery and type of surgery. Conditional logistic regressions were run to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Demographic factors and comorbid conditions associated with an increased adjusted risk of PJI (in decreasing order of significance) were diabetes (OR?=?5.47, 95% CI: 1.77-16.97; p?=?0.003), age (65-75 vs. 45-65 years) (OR?=?3.36, 95% CI: 1.30-8.69; p?=?0.013), BMI (?28 vs. 18.5-28 kg/m2) (OR?=?2.77, 95% CI: 1.20-6.40; p?=?0.017), place of residence (rural) (OR?=?2.63, 95% CI: 1.13-6.10; p?=?0.025) and alcohol abuse (OR?=?2.95, 95% CI: 1.06-8.23; p?=?0.039).Patients with diabetes, older age, BMI of ?28 kg/m2 and alcohol abuse or living in rural areas, had increased PJI risk. Additional systematic large-scale studies are needed to verify these results.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24748009","annotations":[{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.733877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.724376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.678041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.215403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"China","weight":0.214197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0970929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0504415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"TKA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TKA"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"252","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/252"},{"name":"308","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/308"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"}]}
