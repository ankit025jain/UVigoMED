{"id":70342,"title":"Immunological assessment of cryotherapy in breast cancer patients.","abstract":"In murine studies, cryotherapy has induced antitumor immune responses associated with the rejection of tumors. However, the effects of freezing-induced immunomodulation in breast cancer (BC) patients remain unclear.Ten BC patients were prospectively divided into two groups: 1) cryotherapy followed by surgical excision and 2) surgical excision-alone. The cytokine profiles of plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analyzed using flow cytometry following in vitro stimulation with the 30-mer MUC1 peptide.No differences in the percentages of interferon-? (IFN-?)-producing cluster of differentiation (CD)4(+) or CD8(+) T cells and the plasma levels of IFN-?, interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) and TNF-? were observed between these 2 groups, and PBMCs were not significantly altered.Alternations to the type 1 and 2 helper cytokine profiles were not detected in vitro in BC patients treated with cryotherapy-alone.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25202068","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin
