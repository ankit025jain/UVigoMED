{"id":12828,"title":"Alpha amylase enzyme inhibitory and anti-inflammatory effect of Lawsonia inermis.","abstract":"Previously it was reported elsewhere that Lawsonia inermis have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect in experimental animals. The in vitro porcine alpha amylase inhibitory effect was investigated of this plant methanolic extracts and consequently hypoglycemic effect by quantitatively determining the maltose from the maltose standard curve while the anti-inflammatory effect by acetic acid induced writhing test in mice. Acarbose (10 microg mL(-1)) and Diclofenac sodium (20 mg kg(-1)) were used as reference hypoglycemic and anti-inflammatory drugs, respectively, for this study. The methanolic leaves extract of the plant significantly inhibited (60.97% compared to untreated) enzymatic activity of the amylase at 10 microg mL(-1) dose (p < 0.05) also reduced the chemically induced nociceptive pain stimuli significantly at all doses (p < 0.01). Carbohydrates, glycosides, flavonoids, saponins and tannins were found to have in phytochemical screening of the extract which are thought to bring these effects. For the conclusive purpose, it is suggesting from the result that the pharmacological properties of this Lawsonia inermis can elicit hypoglycemic effect by inhibiting alpha-amylase enzyme and can reduce neurogenic pain stimulus. It gives the notion that how this group of patient would be therapeutically benefitted by decreasing both these effects by the same agent which is easy available.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506051","annotations":[{"name":"Phytochemical","weight":0.912664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochemical"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Amylase","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.869218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.784194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Saponin","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponin"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Diclofenac","weight":0.732839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac"},{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.718269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.715993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.711625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Glycoside","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Tannin","weight":0.643316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.515544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Maltose","weight":0.505505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltose"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.427706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.392666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.336785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.179746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.132721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"}]}
