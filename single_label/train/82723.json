{"id":82723,"title":"Microbial microleakage assessment of a new hydrophilic fissure sealant: a laboratory study.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to compare microbial leakage of a new hydrophilic sealant with that of a conventional hydrophobic resin-based sealant.One hundred extracted, caries-free, human maxillary premolars were randomly divided into five groups. Those in Groups 1, 2, and 3 had dry, wet, and artificial saliva-contaminated occlusal surfaces, respectively, and were sealed with a hydrophilic sealant, while those in Groups 4 and 5 had dry and wet occlusal surfaces, respectively, and were sealed with a hydrophobic sealant. A newly designed microbial penetration method utilizing Streptococcus mutans as an indicator was tested for leakage assessment. Data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 software, and the significance level was set at ?=0.05.The log rank test indicated a statistically significant difference in leakage rates among the five groups. Mantel-Cox log-rank test findings showed that Group 3 had the highest leakage rate, with Groups 2 and 4 having the lowest. There was no statistically significant difference in leakage rate between Groups 2 and 4.With respect to the limitations of an in vitro study, our findings suggest that hydrophilic sealants are an acceptable alternative to hydrophobic sealants.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553266","annotations":[{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.5241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.50408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.497478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Streptococcus mutans","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_mutans"},{"name":"Hydrophobe","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe"},{"name":"Hydrophile","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophile"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Conditions races","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_races"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Sweetness of wine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetness_of_wine"},{"name":"Taxonomic rank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Road","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Fissure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissure"},{"name":"No. 1 Group RAF","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._1_Group_RAF"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Sealant","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealant"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"}]}
