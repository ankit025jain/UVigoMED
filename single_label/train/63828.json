{"id":63828,"title":"Asynchronous presentation of follicle center lymphoma and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of the ocular adnexa.","abstract":"Although ocular lymphoproliferative diseases may be rarely encountered by dermatopathologists, the frequency may increase particularly as more and more subspecialties rely on dermatopathology services. Emerging data suggest that there are some similarities between ocular and cutaneous lymphoproliferative diseases with respect to their clinical behavior, prognosis, and cytogenetics. In this case report, a patient with ocular follicle center lymphoma who subsequently developed ocular reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is presented with an accompanying review of the literature on the subjects. The encounter of both follicular center lymphoma and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia in the same patient provides a rare opportunity to compare and contrast the clinical, histological, and immunohistochemical findings of the respective lymphoproliferative diseases situated at opposite ends of the spectrum.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24394299","annotations":[{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.822164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.719817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.533638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.5241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Lymphoproliferative disorders","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoproliferative_disorders"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.29957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.103802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dermatopathology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatopathology"},{"name":"Accessory visual structures","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessory_visual_structures"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Asynchrony","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony"}]}
