{"id":77332,"title":"[Risk assessment of health disorders and quality of life in employees of modern polyvinyl chloride production].","abstract":"The authors analyse changes in exposure load and associated occupational risk, health state of workers engaged into contemporary polyvinyl chloride production. Consideration covered objective parameters--results of thorough medical examinations -and subjective ones--results of quantitative risk evaluation of general pathologic syndromes and life quality caused by health state. The latter were compared with general working population unexposed to the hazards. Findings are statistically significant increase of functional disorders risk connected with cardiovascular and nervous diseases. Correlation was found between cardiovascular diseases prevalence and exposure chemical load. Statistically significant differences were seen in all life quality components between the workers groups compared.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051670","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.664112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.640748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.58717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.518116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.510032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.500577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.238717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Polyvinyl chloride","weight":0.207478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"List of neurological disorders","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neurological_disorders"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
