{"id":48027,"title":"[Regulation of safe levels of polychlorinated biphenyls in soil: Russian and international experience].","abstract":"The article presents data on the levels of soil pollution by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in different regions of Russia and foreign countries. For the time present proposed regulatory value for the regulation of PCBs in soils of different land uses have been established to be set mainly on the results of the calculations of risk. However used initial values and features of the methodology for calculating determine significant variability of proposed levels of PCBs in soils. Analysis of the discussed problem of regulation of PCBs in soils in different countries permitted to make the conclusion that for the sound management of PCBs in the environment, it is necessary, first of all, the solution of questions of selection of a single standardized PCBs sample and the most appropriate method for risk assessment for the characterization of the state of contaminated soils.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Disorders of Environmental Origin","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624822","annotations":[{"name":"Soil","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Land use","weight":0.415743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.380053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.323599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.299388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.253712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Soil contamination","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_contamination"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Polychlorinated biphenyl","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Organochloride","weight":0.0150493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organochloride"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"}]}
