{"id":74786,"title":"Alzheimer presenilin-1 mutations dramatically reduce trimming of long amyloid ?-peptides (A?) by ?-secretase to increase 42-to-40-residue A?.","abstract":"The presenilin-containing ?-secretase complex produces the amyloid ?-peptide (A?) through intramembrane proteolysis, and >100 presenilin mutations are associated with familial early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). The question of whether these mutations result in AD through a gain or a loss of function remains highly controversial. Mutations in presenilins increase ratios of 42- to 40-residue A? critical to pathogenesis, but other A?s of 38-49 residues are also formed by ?-secretase. Evidence in cells suggests the protease first cleaves substrate within the transmembrane domain at the ? site to form 48- or 49-residue A?. Subsequent cleavage almost every three residues from the C terminus is thought to occur along two pathways toward shorter secreted forms of A?: A?49 ? A?46 ? A?43 ? A?40 and A?48 ? A?45 ? A?42 ? A?38. Here we show that the addition of synthetic long A? peptides (A?45-49) directly into purified preparations of ?-secretase leads to the formation of A?40 and A?42 whether the protease complex is detergent-solubilized or reconstituted into lipid vesicles, and the ratios of products A?42 to A?40 follow a pattern consistent with the dual-pathway hypothesis. Kinetic analysis of five different AD-causing mutations in presenilin-1 revealed that all result in drastic reduction of normal carboxypeptidase function. Altered trimming of long A? peptides to A?40 and A?42 by mutant proteases occurs at multiple levels, independent of the effects on initial endoproteolysis at the ? site, all conspiring to increase the critical A?42/A?40 ratio implicated in AD pathogenesis. Taken together, these results suggest that specific reduction of carboxypeptidase function of ?-secretase leads to the gain of toxic A?42/A?40.
