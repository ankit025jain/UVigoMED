{"id":26660,"title":"[Heart rate: clinical variable and risk marker].","abstract":"Heart rate is an easily accessible clinical variable with wide-ranging prognostic impact. Elevated resting heart rate predicts an elevated cardiovascular risk. Epidemiological studies demonstrate a relevant association between heart rate and survival in individuals without diagnosed cardiovascular disease and with cardiovascular disease like hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. Whereas a goal directed pharmacological heart rate reduction is not supported by clinical evidence for primary prevention it plays a prognostic role for patients with CAD? and chronic heart failure. Moreover heart rate can be characterized as an independent risk factor for patients with heart failure and potentially for those with CAD. As a result the common guidelines recommend heart rate reduction as a target of therapy.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25093954","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.539713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.314089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.296247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"}]}
