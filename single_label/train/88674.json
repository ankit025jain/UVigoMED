{"id":88674,"title":"Complete traumatic backout of the blade of proximal femoral nail antirotation: a case report.","abstract":"This article presents a rare case of traumatic complete expulsion of the helical blade after successful treatment of an intertrochanteric fracture with proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA). A 94-year-old woman sustained an intertrochanteric fracture of the left femur. Fracture fixation was performed by using PFNA-II. At six months FU, the patient presented with pain at the proximal lateral left thigh after she had fallen. A protrusion was noted. Radiographs showed a complete expulsion of the helical blade with a healed intertrochanteric fracture. The PFNA-II was removed and a cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty was performed. At 5 months after surgery, the patient was able to walk with a walker without pain. Traumatic complete expulsion of the blade should be considered as a possible complication of PFNA/PFNA-II.
