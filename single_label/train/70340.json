{"id":70340,"title":"The multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI258, alone or in combination with RAD001, is effective for treatment of human leukemia with BCR-ABL translocation in vitro.","abstract":"BCR-ABL-positive (BCR-ABL(+)) leukemia is very difficult to treat although much improvement has been achieved due to the clinical application of imatinib and the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This study aimed to evaluate for the first time the treatment value of the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI258 in BCR-ABL(+) leukemia.Proliferation of different BCR-ABL(+) leukemic cells was measured with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay; cell apoptosis with Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry. Gene expression at the protein level was determined by western blotting.This drug showed treatment efficacy in na√Øve and imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL(+) leukemia cells, particularly in cells harboring T315I-mutated BCR-ABL, for which no effective inhibitor is available to date. By combination with the mTOR inhibitor RAD001, a synergistic effect on cell proliferation was observed in these cell lines.TKI258 may become a potent therapeutic agent, either alone or in combination with RAD001, for treatment of BCR-ABL(+) leukemia.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25202073","annotations":[{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.894133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.855262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.833929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.831493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.597475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.356107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.346332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.218501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"Iodide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodide"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"}]}
