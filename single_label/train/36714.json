{"id":36714,"title":"Transarterial coil-augmented Onyx embolization for brain arteriovenous malformation. Technique and experience in 22 consecutive patients.","abstract":"Onyx has been widely adopted for the treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, its control demands operators accumulate a considerable learning curve. We describe our initial experience using a novel injection method for the embolization of AVMs. We retrospectively reviewed the data of all 22 patients with brain AVMs (12 men, 10 women; age range, 12-68 years; mean age, 43.2 years) treated by the transarterial coil-augmented Onyx injection technique. The size of the AVMs ranged from 25 mm to 70 mm (average 35.6 mm). The technical feasibility of the procedure, procedure-related complications, angiographic results, and clinical outcome were evaluated. In every case, endovascular treatment (EVT) was completed. A total of 31 sessions were performed, with a mean injection volume of 6.1 mL (range, 1.5-16.0 mL). An average of 96.7% (range 85%-100%) estimated size reduction was achieved, and 18 AVMs could be completely excluded by EVT alone. The results remained stable on follow-up angiograms. A procedural complication occurred in one patient, with permanent mild neurologic deficit. Our preliminary series demonstrated that the coil-augmented Onyx injection technique is a valuable adjunct achieving excellent nidal penetration and improving the safety of the procedure.
