{"id":35304,"title":"Mononeuritis multiplex: association with infectious condition and familial background in a tropical environment: a case report.","abstract":"Mononeuritis multiplex is characterized by an asymmetric pattern with affection of the peripheral nervous system; this form of polyneuropathy is often seen in non-systemic vasculitis. We present a case of multiplex neuropathy in a patient with histologicaly verified Hailey-Hailey disease. With the exception of this comorbidity--in its characteristic form presenting additionally with a superinfected subdermal node--we did not find any other possible etiologic factor possibly causative of multiplex neuritis. The diagnosis was confirmed by electrophysiological testing. To our knowledge, this is the first case report indicating a possible relationship between Hailey-Hailey disease and multiplex neuritis. There exists only one related study in the literature, which was conducted in Columbia--our patient's home country. This study delineates a clinically similar dermal disease (pemphigus foliaceus) in patients from rural Colombia (El Bagre). The authors detected anti-neuronal antibodies which were interpreted to be responsible for the pathognomonic burning sensations.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24664309","annotations":[{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.871618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.866911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Pathognomonic","weight":0.734955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathognomonic"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.631923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mononeuritis multiplex","weight":0.388007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononeuritis_multiplex"},{"name":"Polyneuropathy","weight":0.305357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyneuropathy"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.142977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"El Bagre","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Bagre"},{"name":"Pemphigus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemphigus"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Combustion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Affection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"}]}
