{"id":89701,"title":"Using the exudate decision algorithm to evaluate wound dressings.","abstract":"Nurses have shown a weakness both in recognising different types of exudate and in choosing an appropriate dressing (Smith and Gibson, 2011). In order to support nurses in identifying the correct dressing choice, an exudate wound decision algorithm has been developed. The algorithm suggests the type of dressing required for bleeding and infected wounds is a calcium alginate dressing with a silver component. This study has examined the efficacy of calcium alginate dressings with silver in bleeding and infected wounds, selected through the use of the exudate wound decision algorithm. Over four consecutive dressing changes the results show a consistent improvement in all parameters of wound measurement. This demonstrates that the choice of a calcium alginate with silver dressing in the exudate wound decision algorithm will, in appropriate circumstances, provide nurses with an effective dressing choice.
