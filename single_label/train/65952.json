{"id":65952,"title":"[Gangrene of the penis due to strangulation by a rubber band: a case report].","abstract":"We report a case of strangulation of the penis by a rubber band. A 79-year-old man placed a rubber band tightly around the corona of his glans penis in order to prevent urinary incontinence. After five days, he was taken to our hospital in an ambulance for high temperature and general malaise. We found the rubber band and removed it immediately. Gangrene of the penis continued and he did not recover from sepsis, so we performed partial penectomy. After the operation, he completely recovered. Penile strangulation using a soft constricting object such as a rubber band might result in severe complications and we should be careful.
