{"id":60720,"title":"The relationship between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism and hematological malignancy.","abstract":"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the key enzyme for folate metabolism. Previous studies suggest a relationship between its single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of C677T and A1298C with a variety of tumor susceptibility including hematological malignancy. SNP frequency distribution in different ethnic populations might lead to differences in disease susceptibility. There has been little research in Chinese people on the MTHFR SNP with the susceptibility of the hematological malignancy. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between MTHFR SNPs and hematological malignancy in Jiangsu province in China.Gene microarray was used to detect MTHFR C677T and A1298C single nucleotide polymorphism loci on 157 healthy controls and 127 patients from Jiangsu province with hematological malignancies (30 with multiple myeloma, 28 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 22 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 40 with acute myeloid leukemia, and seven with chronic myeloid leukemia).The allele frequency of 677T was 41.3% in patients and 33.1% in controls, showed significant difference (chi2 = 4.08, p = 0.043); 677TT genotype with a high susceptibility to hematological malignancy (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.01 - 4.45, p = 0.041). In subgroup analyses, the genotypes 677TT and 1298CC were associated with significantly increased multiple myeloma risk (TT vs. CC: OR 8.92, 95% CI 1.06 - 75.24, p = 0.006; CC vs. AA: OR = 4.80, 95% CI 1.56 - 14.73, p = 0.044). No associations were found between polymorphisms and susceptibilities to acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.MTHFRC677T polymorphisms influence the risk of hematological malignancy among the population in Jiangsu province. Both MTHFR 677TT and MTHFR 1298CC genotypes increase susceptibility to myeloid leukemia.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
