{"id":18684,"title":"A single genotype of Acinetobacter baumannii expresses multiple antibiotic susceptibility phenotypes.","abstract":"It is common practice to define a bacterium with unequal antibiotic susceptibility phenotypes as a different genotype. Here, we describe the utility of this practice for Acinetobacter baumannii. We determined antibiotic susceptibility for 19 clinical isolates of A baumannii. Repetitive sequence polymerase chain reaction method was used to determine genotypes. Although all isolates were of the same genotype, 79% were predicted to be different based on susceptibility patterns. The antibiotic susceptibility phenotype does not accurately predict the genotype of A baumannii.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773796","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.809718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.428024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.18188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.114781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Acinetobacter baumannii","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter_baumannii"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Protein structure prediction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure_prediction"},{"name":"Common practice period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_practice_period"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"}]}
