{"id":88469,"title":"Spontaneous obliteration of right ventricular pseudoaneurysm after blunt chest trauma: diagnosis and follow-up with multidetector CT.","abstract":"Right ventricular (RV) pseudoaneurysm caused by trauma is very rare. We report a case of RV pseudoaneurysm which resolved without surgical treatment in a patient who survived a falling accident. Echocardiography failed to identify the pseudoaneurysm. Electrocardiography-gated CT showed a 17-mm-sized saccular pseudoaneurysm arising from the RV outflow tract with a narrow neck. Follow-up CT after two months showed spontaneous obliteration of the lesion.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843237","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.786427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.711457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.675823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.535875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.435994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Chest trauma","weight":0.0239124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_trauma"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0193016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Outflow (meteorology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outflow_(meteorology)"},{"name":"Recreational vehicle","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle"}]}
