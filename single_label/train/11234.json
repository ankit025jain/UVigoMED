{"id":11234,"title":"Application of tension-free hernioplasty with hernia meshes of different materials and the postoperative effects on the reproductive function of male rats.","abstract":"This study aimed to compare the effects of polypropylene (PP), lightweight PP (UP) and expanded polytetrafluorethylene (e-PTFE) hernia mesh on the reproductive function of adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats following open tension-free hernioplasty. Forty adult SD rats were obtained and divided into five groups: A sham-operated (FO) group, an e-PTFE mesh group, a PP mesh group, the UP mesh group and a normal control (NC) group (without any surgical manipulation). Ninety days following open tension-free hernioplasty, hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunhistochemistry were used to observe the pathological changes of the testicular tissue and to compare the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1? (HIF?1?) in the rat testis, respectively. ELISA was used to analyze the serum concentration of antisperm antibodies (AsAbs) and routine semen testing was conducted to measure the percentage of grade a+b sperm from the epididymis. More than 50% of mesh adherence to the spermatic cord was observed in the PP and UP groups, and mild or no adhesion was observed in the NC, FO and e-PTFE groups. In the UP and PP groups, marked congestion of necrotic tissue was observed in the seminiferous tubule cavity, a significant reduction in the percentage of grade a+b sperm and a significant increase in the expression levels of AsAbs and HIF-?. It was concluded that the e-PTFE mesh exhibited a marginal effect on the reproductive function of rats compared with that of the PP and UP mesh and is more suitable for tension-free hernioplasty. The clinical significance of these results requires further elucidation with a multi-centered prospective study.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603965","annotations":[{"name":"Epididymis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epididymis"},{"name":"Spermatic cord","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatic_cord"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Seminiferous tubule","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminiferous_tubule"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Semen analysis","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_analysis"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.753561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.732712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.661552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.455411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Polypropylene","weight":0.298912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene"},{"name":"H&E stain","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H&E_stain"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.0459885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Polytetrafluoroethylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene"},{"name":"Haematoxylin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematoxylin"},{"name":"Eosin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosin"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Mesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh"},{"name":"Tubule","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubule"},{"name":"Spermatic plexus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatic_plexus"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
