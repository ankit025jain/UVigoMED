{"id":88162,"title":"Gcsf-Chr19 promotes neutrophil migration to damaged tissue through blood vessels in zebrafish.","abstract":"G-CSF is an essential cytokine that regulates proliferation and differentiation of granulocytes from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. In mammals G-CSF has been identified as a key factor that promotes the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow into the blood circulation. In silico analysis indicates that zebrafish has two gcsf genes, gcsf-chr12 in chromosome 12 and gcsf-chr19 in chromosome 19. Gcsf-Chr12 participates in emergency myelopoiesis, but, in contrast to its mammalian orthologue, is not involved in neutrophil migration toward damaged tissue. In turn, the function of Gcsf-Chr19 has not been examined yet. In this study, we analyzed the role of Gcsf-Chr19 in regulating neutrophil migration toward the wound. Our results indicated that during the first h after caudal fin transection, neutrophils migrate from the hematopoietic tissue toward the injury, using the extracellular matrix as a substrate. Later, between 3 and 4 h postdamage, the recruitment mainly occurs through the bloodstream, and only a few neutrophils still use the extracellular matrix to migrate. During this process, the transcriptional levels of gcsf-chr19 are considerably increased, reaching a peak 1 h postdamage. The knockdown of Gcsf-chr19 indicated that the percentage of neutrophils that reach the wound decreased after the first h postinjury, suggesting that the knockdown specifically affects neutrophils that travel to the wound through blood vessels. Together, our data provide novel information about the regulation of neutrophil migration in zebrafish, positioning Gcsf-Chr19 as a key signal during the course of an inflammatory process triggered by severe damage.
