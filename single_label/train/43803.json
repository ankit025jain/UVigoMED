{"id":43803,"title":"PLCE1 suppresses p53 expression in esophageal cancer cells.","abstract":"The apoptotic mechanism dysfunction plays a critical role in cancer cell growth and escaping from cancer therapies; the underlying mechanisms are to be further elucidated. This study aims to investigate the role of phospholipase C epsilon 1 (PLCE1) in modulating the apoptosis mechanism in esophageal cancer (Eca) cells. The results showed that Eca cell lines, OE33 and CP-C cells expressed high levels of PLCE1. Knockdown of PLCE1 markedly increased 9.26 folds of the expression of p53 and 13.8 folds of the frequency of apoptotic CP-C cells via modulating the p53 promoter methylation.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766303","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.798233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.755011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.734955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.630405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.559801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.296392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Phospholipase C","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_C"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Personal Load Carrying Equipment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Load_Carrying_Equipment"},{"name":"PLCE1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLCE1"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Communist Party of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China"},{"name":"Epsilon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Old English","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English"}]}
