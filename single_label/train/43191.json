{"id":43191,"title":"Cytotoxicity of ultrafine monodispersed nanoceria on human gastric cancer cells.","abstract":"The safety and toxicity of CeO2 nanoparticles (nanoceria) are of growing concern due to their potential applications in biological and medical fields based on the radical scavenging and UV-filtering properties. In this paper, the ultrafine monodisperse (2-5 nm) water-insoluble (CeO2-P) and water-soluble nanoceria modified with various functional groups of dextran (CeO2-dextran), polyacrylic acid (CeO2-PAA) and ethylenediamine (CeO2-EDA) on surface were synthesized via alkaline-based precipitation and inverse microemulsion methods. The cell uptaking, oxidative stress and cytotoxicity of these nanoceria on human gastric cancer cell line (BGC-803) were systematically investigated. It is found that the cell uptaking of nanoceria is largely relied on the function groups on its surfaces and followed the order: CeO2-P > CeO2-EDA > CeO2-dextran > CeO2-PAA. Moreover, the oxidative stress of BGC-803 cells is obviously affected by the antioxidant capacity of nanoceria determined by Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio, which eventually causes the cell viability variable once the nanoceria entered into BGC-803 cells. In addition, the cell viability is also closely correlated with the concentration and surface characteristics of nanoceria. The cytotoxicity of nanoceria on BGC-803 cells is largely dependent on its surface functional groups. Our work may provide guidance on the cytotoxicity of ultrafine monodisperse nanoceria for their uses in biological and medical fields.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804543","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.70997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.680167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.663387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.645936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.642864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.541871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Monodisperse","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monodisperse"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.356577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.309191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Precipitation (meteorology)","weight":0.302615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Ethylenediamine","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylenediamine"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Dextran","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextran"},{"name":"Microemulsion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microemulsion"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Cerium","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerium"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Scavenger (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Oxygen radical absorbance capacity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_radical_absorbance_capacity"},{"name":"Ultrafine particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafine_particle"}]}
