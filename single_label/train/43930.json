{"id":43930,"title":"Evaluation and treatment of colonic symptoms.","abstract":"Important considerations for constipation include: 1. Initial evaluation should evaluate for fecal incontinence, fecal impaction, medication side effects, concerning symptoms, underlying medical or metabolic issues and irritable bowel syndrome. 2. History and examination should be used to determine if a defecatory disorder is most likely. a. If defecatory disorder is likely, testing with balloon expulsion or anal manometry can be considered and, if confirmed, treatment with biofeedback (if testing not available, it is reasonable to trial fiber and laxatives because many patients have a mixed disorder). b. If it is unlikely, proceed with trial of fiber and/or osmotic laxatives. 3. If continued symptoms, consider trial of newer agent (lubiprostone or linaclotide). 4. If ineffective, consider testing for colon transit time and referral to gastroenterology.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758959","annotations":[{"name":"Fecal incontinence","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_incontinence"},{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Biofeedback","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofeedback"},{"name":"Fecal impaction","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_impaction"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Laxative","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxative"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.711665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.684672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Osmosis","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis"},{"name":"Lubiprostone","weight":0.207246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubiprostone"},{"name":"Manometry","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manometry"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.183573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Impaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaction"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
