{"id":46027,"title":"Microsatellite stable colorectal cancers stratified by the BRAF V600E mutation show distinct patterns of chromosomal instability.","abstract":"The BRAF (V600E) mutation in colorectal cancers that are microsatellite stable (MSS) confers a poor patient prognosis, whereas BRAF mutant microsatellite-unstable (MSI) colorectal cancers have an excellent prognosis. BRAF wild type cancers are typically MSS and display chromosomal instability (CIN). CIN has not been extensively studied on a genome-wide basis in relation to BRAF mutational status in colorectal cancer. BRAF mutant/MSS (BRAFmut/MSS) cancers (n = 33) and BRAF mutant/MSI (BRAFmut/MSI) cancers (n = 30) were compared for presence of copy number aberrations (CNAs) indicative of CIN, with BRAF wild type/MSS (BRAFwt/MSS) cancers (n = 18) using Illumina CytoSNP-12 arrays. BRAFmut/MSS and BRAFwt/MSS cancers showed comparable numbers of CNAs/cancer at 32.8 and 29.8 respectively. However, there were differences in patterns of CNA length between MSS cohorts, with BRAFmut/MSS cancers having significantly greater proportions of focal CNAs compared to BRAFwt/MSS cancers (p<0.0001); whereas whole chromosomal arm CNAs were more common in BRAFwt/MSS cancers (p<0.0001). This related to a reduced average CNA length in BRAFmut/MSS compared to BRAFwt/MSS cancers (20.7 Mb vs 33.4 Mb;p<0.0001); and a smaller average percent of CIN affected genomes in BRAFmut/MSS compared to BRAFwt/MSS cancers (23.9% vs 34.9% respectively). BRAFmut/MSI cancers were confirmed to have low CNA rates (5.4/cancer) and minimal CIN-affected genomes (average of 4.5%) compared to MSS cohorts (p<0.0001). BRAFmut/MSS cancers had more frequent deletion CNAs compared to BRAFwt/MSS cancers on 6p and 17q at loci not typically correlated with colorectal cancer, and greater amplification CNAs on 8q and 18q compared to BRAFwt/MSS cancers. These results indicate that comparable rates of CIN occur between MSS subgroups, however significant differences in their patterns of instability exist, with BRAFmut/MSS cancers showing a 'focal pattern' and BRAFwt/MSS cancers having a 'whole arm pattern' of CIN. This and the genomic loci more frequently affected in BRAFmut/MSS cancers provides further evidence of the biological distinctions of this important cancer subgroup.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651849","annotations":[{"name":"Microsatellite (genetics)","weight":0.856791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(genetics)"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"},{"name":"Illumina (company)","weight":0.795452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina_(company)"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.790876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.763352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.614233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.59269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.578702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Chromosome 6 (human)","weight":0.536874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_6_(human)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.504628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Megabase","weight":0.0744015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabase"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_intraepithelial_neoplasia"},{"name":"Fibre Channel over Ethernet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre_Channel_over_Ethernet"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"}]}
