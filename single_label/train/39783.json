{"id":39783,"title":"Laparoscopic repair for failed antireflux procedures.","abstract":"Minimally invasive procedures have become common, and more reoperations for failed antireflux procedures are performed laparoscopically. We wanted to study the outcomes of laparoscopic reoperations for reflux.Medical records of all patients who underwent reoperation without esophageal resection after previous antireflux procedures between January 2000 and October 2012 were reviewed.Seventy-five patients were included in this report: 56 (77%) women and 19 (23%) men. Median age was 58 years. The previous operation was laparoscopic antireflux procedures in 65 (87%) patients. The median interval between the last antireflux procedure and laparoscopic reoperation was 42 months. The median body mass index (BMI) was 28.7. All patients were symptomatic. Intraoperative findings included recurrent hiatal hernia in 47 (63%) patients, incompetent fundoplication in 14 (19%) patients, tight fundoplication in 8 (11%) patients, and tight crura in 2 (3%) patients. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was performed in 57 (76%) patients, partial posterior fundoplication was performed in 12 (16%) patients, partial anterior fundoplication was performed in 3 (4%) patients, removal of crural stitches was performed in 2 patients, and a combination of partial posterior fundoplication and removal of crural stiches was performed in 1 patient. Complications occurred in 13 (15%) patients. Improvement in symptoms was observed in 70 (93%) patients in early postoperative follow-up and in 59 (78%) patients in long-term follow-up. Functional results were classified as excellent in 59 (78%) patients, good in 6 (7%) patients, fair in 7 (8%) patients, and poor in 3 (4%) patients.Laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux operations is a complex procedure, but it is safe and effective in selected patients. Reoperation after a failed antireflux repair results in excellent or good functional status in a majority of patients, but these results may deteriorate over time.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25129552","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.927519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.814336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.435712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.432915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.355405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.313385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.222407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hiatus hernia","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_hernia"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.152729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Nissen fundoplication","weight":0.136252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissen_fundoplication"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.0934788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"}]}
