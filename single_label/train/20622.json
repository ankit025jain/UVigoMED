{"id":20622,"title":"How might a diagnostic microRNA signature be used to speed up the diagnosis of sepsis?","abstract":"Sepsis is a heterogeneous illness characterised by inflammation secondary to suspected or proven infection. A clinical and research challenge in this area is the ability to diagnose true sepsis, defined as inflammation secondary to infection. Infection is often indirectly confirmed using surrogates, whilst awaiting microbiological confirmation. microRNAs are novel molecules with a potential to be point of care rapid diagnostic test for true sepsis.
