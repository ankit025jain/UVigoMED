{"id":81602,"title":"Simplified basic periodontal examination (BPE) in children and adolescents: a guide for general dental practitioners.","abstract":"Dental plaque-induced periodontal diseases are common in children and adults. Guidelines were previously not available for the periodontal screening of under 18s. However, new guidelines have been introduced by the British Society of Periodontology and the British Society of Paediatric Dentistry which set out recommendations for the periodontal screening and management of under 18s in primary dental care. This article provides a practical guide for general dental practitioners on how to use the BPE in children and adolescents, and highlights the importance of early detection and management of periodontal diseases in this age group. A failure to use the modified BPE in a young patient who is later diagnosed with periodontitis may leave a dentist vulnerable to a medico-legal complaint or claim.New BPE guidelines for children and adolescents have been introduced by the BSPD and BSP; it is important that all dentists are aware of these guidelines and how to implement them in general practice.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930254","annotations":[{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.454937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Detective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective"},{"name":"Simplified Chinese characters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Bachelor of Physical Education","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Physical_Education"},{"name":"England national under-18 football team","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_under-18_football_team"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Complaint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Medical law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_law"}]}
