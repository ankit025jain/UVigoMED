{"id":71963,"title":"A case of dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumor in the pelvis with TP53 mutation.","abstract":"Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs), initially observed in the pleura, were later found to develop in almost any extrapleural site. Dedifferentiation within SFTs was characterized only recently. We report a case of dedifferentiated SFT arising within the pelvis of a 70-year-old Japanese woman. Macroscopically, the resected tumor measured 17?×?17?×?13 cm. Histologically, the tumor displayed distinct heterologous osteosarcomatous and chondrosarcomatous components on a background of conventional SFT. Immunohistochemistry uncovered a loss of CD34 expression in the dedifferentiated area, whereas the nuclear expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT6) and NGFI-A-binding protein 2 (NAB2) was maintained in both components. The p53 mutation 158 CGC > CAC (A158H) was found only in the dedifferentiated component. Furthermore, a fusion gene of NAB2(exon6)-STAT6(exon18) was detected in both the conventional and dedifferentiated components. The patient died of the disease 4 months after surgery. This case identifies a possible role of p53 dysfunction in the dedifferentiation process of SFT as reported in other sarcomas.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015562","annotations":[{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.920209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Fusion gene","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_gene"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.831559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.661076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.652873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"STAT6","weight":0.545754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT6"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0411934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Transducer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Heterologous","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}]}
