{"id":14318,"title":"[Influence of the long-term administration of torasemide on morphometric characteristics of cardiac muscle under conditions of developed experimental postinfarction cardiosclerosis].","abstract":"The possible antifibrotic effect of torasemide used for the treatment of model chronic heart failure (CHF) has been studied in rats aged 12 months with developed postinfarction cardiosclerosis (PICS). The antifibrotic effect was evaluated of the course of torasemide administration in a daily dose of 0.13 mg/kg. A comparative analysis showed that torasemide did not affect the state of connective tissues in cardiac muscles of both intact rats and those with PICS. It was concluded that manifestations of the antifibrotic effect of torasemide can be related to the nosological form of CHF.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432564","annotations":[{"name":"Nosology","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.748002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.710495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.659065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.498941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.29088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Torasemide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torasemide"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Platform for Internet Content Selection","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_for_Internet_Content_Selection"}]}
