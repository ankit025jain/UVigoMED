{"id":16370,"title":"[Selected mechanisms of pathogenicity of Campylobacter jejuni].","abstract":"Campylobacter jejuni is one of the most common causes of bacterial diarrhea worldwide. Various virulence factors of C. jejuni contribute to survival and participate in the induction of infection in the human body. The virulence mechanisms such as motility, toxin production or invasive properties allow the bacteria to survive in the human body. The article presents the current knowledge on selected virulence mechanisms of C. jejuni.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25007513","annotations":[{"name":"Campylobacter","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Virulence factor","weight":0.626571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence_factor"},{"name":"Campylobacter jejuni","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter_jejuni"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Pathogenicity","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenicity"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
