{"id":27951,"title":"Knowledge discovery of drug data on the example of adverse reaction prediction.","abstract":"Antibiotics are the widely prescribed drugs for children and most likely to be related with adverse reactions. Record on adverse reactions and allergies from antibiotics considerably affect the prescription choices. We consider this a biomedical decision-making problem and explore hidden knowledge in survey results on data extracted from a big data pool of health records of children, from the Health Center of Osijek, Eastern Croatia.We applied and evaluated a k-means algorithm to the dataset to generate some clusters which have similar features. Our results highlight that some type of antibiotics form different clusters, which insight is most helpful for the clinician to support better decision-making.Medical professionals can investigate the clusters which our study revealed, thus gaining useful knowledge and insight into this data for their clinical studies.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25079450","annotations":[{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.720697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.657844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.646638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.342095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.323625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.263573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Croatia","weight":0.241923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data mining","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Osijek","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osijek"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Occult","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Discovery (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"}]}
