{"id":69936,"title":"Polymeric nanoparticle-mediated silencing of CD44 receptor in CD34+ acute myeloid leukemia cells.","abstract":"The adhesion receptor CD44 plays an important role in the survival and retention of leukemic stem/progenitor cells (LSPC) within the bone marrow (BM) niche, as well as in the high relapse rates of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Down-regulating CD44 could be clinically relevant not only for suppression of the deregulated function of LSPC but also in LSPC response to chemotherapeutic agents. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery is a promising approach for AML treatment, and we recently reported effective siRNA delivery into difficult-to-transfect AML cell lines using lipid-substituted polyethylenimine/siRNA complexes (polymeric nanoparticles). In this study, we investigated polymeric nanoparticle-mediated silencing of CD44 in CD34+ LSPC cell models (leukemic KG-1 and KG-1a cell lines) as well as primary AML cells. Polymeric nanoparticle-mediated silencing decreased surface CD44 levels in KG-1, KG-1a and primary AML cells by up to 27%, 30% and 20% at day 3, respectively. Moreover, CD44 silencing resulted in induction of apoptosis in KG-1 cells, reduced adhesion of KG-1 and KG-1a cells to hyaluronic acid-coated cell culture plates and BM-MSC, and decreased adhesion of primary AML cells to BM-MSC. Our results suggest that polymeric nanoparticle-mediated silencing of CD44 might be a useful technique for inhibiting LSPC interactions with their microenvironment, thereby prohibiting leukemia progression or sensitizing LSPC to chemotherapy.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25262448","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.893239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"CD44","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD44"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.813201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.71151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.642385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.621221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.615926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.524799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.471614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.392335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ecological niche","weight":0.154458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Petri dish","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_dish"}]}
