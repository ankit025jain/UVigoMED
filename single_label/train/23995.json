{"id":23995,"title":"Recurrent Mycobacterium haemophilum in a renal transplant recipient.","abstract":"Mycobacterium haemophilum is a rare isolate of non-tuberculous Mycobacterium which has been reported to affect immunocompromised patients. We report a case of a 32-year-old renal transplant patient with M.? haemophilum infection initially involving his left sinus which was treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy for thirteen months. Two weeks after cessation of antibiotics the infection rapidly recurred in his skin and soft tissues of his hands and feet. This case highlights the difficult diagnostic and therapeutic implications of atypical infections in transplant patients. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of relapsed M. ?haemophilum infection in a renal transplant recipient.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460607","annotations":[{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.804684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.797654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.763548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.445761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
