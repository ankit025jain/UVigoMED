{"id":90437,"title":"[National data set \"emergency department\": development, structure and approval by the Deutsche Interdisziplinäre Vereinigung für Intensivmedizin und Notfallmedizin].","abstract":"The Deutsche Interdisziplinäre Vereinigung für Intensivmedizin und Notfallmedizin (DIVI) is divided into sections one of which is the \"Sektion Notaufnahmeprotokoll\" (emergency department protocol section) founded in 2007. The main task was to create a national data set for the documentation of patients in emergency departments (ED).In order to create such a data set a careful look was taken at the current state of documentation in many different hospitals throughout Germany. In addition, existing registries and international requirements were also taken into consideration. The content of the dataset \"ED documentation\" was developed in interdisciplinary and interprofessional expert rounds.The dataset \"ED documentation\" forms the first basis for documentation in German EDs. The modular data set contains 676 fields and covers all relevant information of the whole clinical process in the ED. Legal issues as well as several aspects for internal and external quality management are also included. For this reason the data of several German quality registries (e.g. TraumaRegister DGU® of the German Society of Trauma Surgery) are part of the data set. Furthermore, the data set forms the basis for several financial and billing aspects. A set of six forms was created in accordance with the developed modular data set. In 2010 the data set was approved by the executive committee of the DIVI. Several German medical associations (e.g. German Association for Emergency Medicine/Deutsche Gesellschaft Interdisziplinäre Notfall- und Akutmedizin, DGINA) recommend its use. Currently 80 hospitals are using the data set.Beside the ability to exchange information the presented data set is the basis for internal and external quality assessment in the ED even if most of the available scoring and benchmarking tools are not validated for the German medical system. Implementing an ED register in Germany which is planned in the future, could close this gap.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Wounds and
