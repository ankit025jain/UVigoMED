{"id":56400,"title":"Chronic herpes simplex virus type 2 encephalitis associated with posterior uveitis.","abstract":"We report on a patient with chronic herpes simplex virus-2 encephalitis who was characteristic for concomitantly having chronic or recurrent posterior uveitis. A 66-year-old immunocompetent man suffering from a 6-month refractory posterior uveitis developed a 1-month history of impaired short-term memory and orientation. Brain MRI demonstrated hyperintense lesions in the right parietal lobe in diffusion and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed mild pleocytosis and increased protein concentration. Quantitative PCR for HSV-2 DNA was positive in CSF. Treated with acyclovir, his cognitive functions gradually improved and the posterior uveitis was cured. Clinicians must be aware that HSV-2 should be considered in the aetiological investigation of chronic encephalitis in an immunocompetent patient. HSV-2 is well known for its ability to cause unilateral chronic or recurrent posterior uveitis. Therefore, posterior uveitis should be considered as an associated feature of HSV-2 encephalitis.
