{"id":20285,"title":"Diagnostic value of direct fluorescence antibody staining for detecting Pneumocystis jirovecii in expectorated sputum from patients with HIV infection.","abstract":"Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining of induced sputum is frequently used to diagnose Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, although induction can provoke nausea and bronchospasm. Since the diagnostic value of expectorated sputum examined with DFA stain has not been well evaluated, we reviewed the medical records of HIV-infected patients who were clinically diagnosed as having PCP between 1999 and 2011. Over this 13-year period, we found 76 patients whose records included the results of DFA staining of expectorated sputum and noted that 42 (55.3%) were positive. Polymerase chain reaction to detect Pneumocystis in the sputum of 65 of the patients resulted in the finding of 43 (66.2%) who were positive. Our findings suggest that DFA staining of expectorated sputum could be a useful initial diagnostic method in HIV-infected patients with PCP.
