{"id":76920,"title":"Nutritional profiles of urban and rural men of Punjab with regard to dietary fat intake.","abstract":"This study was undertaken to determine the quantity and type of fat consumed by urban and rural men in relation to BMI. Researchers surveyed 200 Punjabi men from rural and urban areas of Ludhiana District; total fat intake (74 g/day) by urban men was significantly more than that of men in rural areas. The energy percentage from total fat was positively and significantly (p ? .05) associated with BMI, accounting for 3.1%, 4.2%, and 2.9% of variation in the rural, urban, and total sample, respectively. Fatty-acid ratios were closer to recommendations for urban men than for men from rural areas.
