{"id":54653,"title":"Assessment of serum lipids in patients with age related macular degeneration from Pakistan.","abstract":"To determine serum lipids in patients with age related macular degeneration from Pakistani population.The study was a cross sectional, randomized and case-control. Selected subjects ages were > or = 50 years and were normotensive, non-diabetic with no family history of any such disease and no complication of posterior ocular chamber other than age related macular degeneration (AMD). Controls were age matched healthy individuals with no symptoms of AMD. Diagnosis of AMD was done through conventional diagnostic techniques by professional ophthalmologists. Serum samples were analyzed for total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and HDL using commercially available kits. Data were compared with Student's t-test. Pearson correlation was calculated for relationship between different parameters. P < 0.05 was considered significant.Compared to controls, AMD patients had significantly greater total cholesterol concentration (p < 0.041), and power HDL/LDL ratio (p < 0.038), while serum triglycerides, HDL and LDL were non-significantly different from control subjects. Total cholesterol in AMD patients was significantly correlated with TG, LDL and HDL (p < 0.0001).The study indicates that high cholesterol might be a predictor of AMD and can be a diagnostic parameter.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252486","annotations":[{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.875712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.712318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.709619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.679258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.528692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.492546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.459674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.407562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Family history (medicine)","weight":0.249642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.221984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.166855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.129709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
