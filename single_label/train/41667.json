{"id":41667,"title":"Combination therapy of gamma-aminobutyric acid derivative promotes proton pump inhibitor based healing of reflux esophagitis in animal model.","abstract":"The present study was undertaken to elucidate the effect of omeprazole and baclofen on experimental esophagitis in albino rats.Groups of rats, fasted overnight received normal saline (3 ml/kg, ip; sham control) or toxic control (3 ml/kg, ip) or omeprazole (30 mg/kg, ip) or baclofen (20 mg/kg, ip) or their combinations, were subjected to the pylorus and forestomach ligation. Animals were sacrificed after 6 h and evaluated for the gastric pH, volume of gastric juices, total acidity, esophagitis index and free acidity. Esophageal tissues were further subjected to estimations of TBARS, GSH, catalase and SOD.Treatment with omeprazole and baclofen significantly inhibited the gastric secretion, total acidity and esophagitis index. The treatment also helped to restore the altered level's oxidative stress parameters to normal.The beneficial effect of omeprazole and baclofen against GERD could be conglomerately attributed to the antisectretory action of omeprazole and reduction in the tracheal lower esophageal sphincter release rate by baclofen.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Digestive System
