{"id":44919,"title":"Omental torsion in a captive polar bear (Ursus maritimus).","abstract":"This is the first case report of an omental torsion in a polar bear (Ursus maritimus). A captive, 23-yr-old, 250-kg, intact female polar bear presented to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Medical Center with a 2-day history of lethargy, depression, and vomiting. Abdominal ultrasound identified large amounts of hyperechoic free peritoneal fluid. Ultrasound-guided abdominocentesis was performed and yielded thick serosanguinous fluid compatible with a hemoabdomen. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a large amount of malodorous, serosanguineous fluid and multiple necrotic blood clots associated with a torsion of the greater omentum and rupture of a branch of the omental artery. A partial omentectomy was performed to remove the necrotic tissue and the abdomen was copiously lavaged. The polar bear recovered successfully and is reported to be clinically well 6 mo later. This condition should be considered as a differential in bears with clinical signs of intestinal obstruction and hemoabdomen.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712179","annotations":[{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.76252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Polar bear","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Greater omentum","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.419468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.3987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.379552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.325174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.266196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Minnesota","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"},{"name":"Bear","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear"},{"name":"University of Minnesota","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Testicular torsion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_torsion"},{"name":"Chemical polarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_polarity"},{"name":"Odor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odor"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
