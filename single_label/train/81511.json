{"id":81511,"title":"Restorative therapy of erosive lesions.","abstract":"When substance loss caused by erosive tooth wear reaches a certain degree, oral rehabilitation becomes necessary. Until some 20 years ago, the severely eroded dentition could only be rehabilitated by the provision of extensive crown and bridge work or removable overdentures. As a result of the improvements in resin composite restorative materials, and in adhesive techniques, it has become possible to rehabilitate eroded dentitions in a less invasive manner. However, even today advanced erosive destruction requires the placement of more extensive restorations such as overlays and crowns. It has to be kept in mind that the etiology of the erosive lesions needs to be determined in order to halt the disease, otherwise the erosive process will continue to destroy tooth substance. This overview presents aspects concerning the restorative materials as well as the treatment options available to rehabilitate patients with erosive tooth wear, from minimally invasive direct composite reconstructions to adhesively retained all-ceramic restorations. Restorative treatment is dependent on individual circumstances and the perceived needs and concerns of the patient. Long-term success is only possible when the cause is eliminated. In all situations, the restorative preparations have to follow the principles of minimally invasive treatment.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993273","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.704907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.463022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.371348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.328847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.161995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.144614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.143256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Dental restorative materials","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restorative_materials"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Train station","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Overlay (programming)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_(programming)"}]}
