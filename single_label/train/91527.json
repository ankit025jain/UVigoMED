{"id":91527,"title":"The role of esophageal stent placement in the management of postesophagectomy anastomotic leak.","abstract":"Anastomotic leak after esophagectomy is one of the most challenging complications resulting in a high morbidity and mortality and prolonged hospitalization. The study intended to assess the outcome of endoluminal self-expanding stent in the treatment of this problem.Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Arhus University Hospital, Skejby, Arhus, Denmark. A retrospective study.From January 2007 to December 2010, 209 patients underwent esophagectomy for malignant disease of the esophagus or the cardia. Twenty patients developed anastomotic leak. Treatment consisted of conservative measures, surgery, and stent placement. Details of treatment, clinical outcome, complications, and mortality were evaluated.None.One hundred and forty-seven patients (70.3%) had carcinoma of the cardia, whereas 62 patients (29.7%) had esophageal carcinoma. Twenty patients (9.5%) developed anastomotic leak; small (<1 cm) in two patients (10%); managed conservatively and bigger than 1 cm in 15 patients (75%); treated with an esophageal stent (Hanaro stent, DIAGMED Healthcare, Thirsk, YO7 3TD, United Kingdom). In three patients (15%), perforation of the staple line of the intrathoracic gastric conduit was found and managed by reoperation. Functional sealing of anastomoses after stent placement could be achieved in 10 patients (67%). Stent-related morbidity developed in five patients (33%): Migration of the stent, n=3 and tracheoesophageal fistula, n=2. Stents were smoothly removed 3 weeks after discharge. The mean hospital stay was 25 days. There was only one stent-related death (6.6%).Endoluminal stent implantation is an effective and safe option in the management of postesophagectomy leaks.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496156","annotations":[{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Esophagectomy","weight":0.809613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagectomy"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.740542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tracheoesophageal fistula","weight":0.73581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheoesophageal_fistula"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.675211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.657598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.636827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.593459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Cardiothoracic surgery","weight":0.573774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiothoracic_surgery"},{"name":"Thoracic cavity","weight":0.562302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.547756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.504881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.425309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.399256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cardia","weight":0.353517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.122553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0658585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Staple food","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Manager (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
