{"id":16416,"title":"Invasive pneumococcal disease after implementation of 13-valent conjugate vaccine.","abstract":"To examine whether there is a different clinical profile and severity of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children caused by nonvaccine types in the era of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13).Observational study of childhood IPD in Massachusetts based on state public health surveillance data comparing pre-PCV13 (2007-2009) and post-PCV13 (2010-2012) eras.There were 168 pre-PCV13 cases of IPD and 85 post-PCV13 cases of IPD in Massachusetts children ?5 years of age. PCV13 serotypes declined by 18% in the first 2 years after PCV13 use (P = .011). In the post-PCV13 phase, a higher proportion of children were hospitalized (57.6% vs. 50.6%), and a higher proportion of children had comorbidity (23.5% vs. 19.6%). Neither difference was statistically significant, nor were comparisons of IPD caused by vaccine and nonvaccine types. Children with comorbidities had higher rates of IPD caused by a nonvaccine type (27.6% vs. 17.2%; P = .085), were more likely to be hospitalized (80.4% vs. 50%; P < .0001), and were more likely to have a longer hospital stay (median of 3 days vs. 0.5 days; P = .0001).Initial data suggest that nonvaccine serotypes are more common in children with underlying conditions, who have greater morbidity from disease. In the post-PCV13 era, a larger proportion of patients are hospitalized, but mortality rates are unchanged. Routine vaccination with PCV13 may not be enough to reduce the risk in patients with comorbidity.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25002663","annotations":[{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.950355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.840486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.735843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.680616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.226227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.223431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Massachusetts","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.203192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.154971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Clinical surveillance","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_surveillance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Bus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"},{"name":"Conjugate prior","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
