{"id":68806,"title":"Long non-coding RNA UCA1 increases chemoresistance of bladder cancer cells by regulating Wnt signaling.","abstract":"Chemotherapy is a reasonable alternative to cystectomy in patients with invasive and advanced bladder cancer. However, bladder cancer cells often develop drug resistance to these therapies, and ~ 50% of patients with advanced bladder cancer do not respond to chemotherapy. Recent studies have shown that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is involved in the development of chemoresistance. Here we investigated the role of the urothelial cancer-associated 1 (UCA1) lncRNA in cisplatin resistance during chemotherapy for bladder cancer. We showed that cisplatin-based chemotherapy results in up-regulation of UCA1 expression in patients with bladder cancer. Similarly, UCA1 levels are increased in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells. Over-expression of UCA1 significantly increases the cell viability during cisplatin treatment, whereas UCA1 knockdown reduces the cell viability during cisplatin treatment. UCA1 inhibition also partially overcomes drug resistance in cisplatin-resistant T24 cells. Furthermore, we showed that UCA1 positively regulates expression of wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 6 (Wnt6) in human bladder cancer cell lines. UCA1 and Wnt6 expression is also positively correlated in vivo. Up-regulation of UCA1 activates Wnt signaling in a Wnt6-dependent manner. We finally demonstrate that UCA1 increases the cisplatin resistance of bladder cancer cells by enhancing the expression of Wnt6, and thus represents a potential target to overcome chemoresistance in bladder cancer.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495014","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.894038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.433706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Wnt signaling pathway","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.257057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Non-coding RNA","weight":0.165553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.1125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.109465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Mouse mammary tumor virus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_mammary_tumor_virus"},{"name":"Long non-coding RNA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"}]}
