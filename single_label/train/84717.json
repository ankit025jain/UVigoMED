{"id":84717,"title":"[Chrysotile-asbestos induces cytogenetic effects in the rat's mesothelium in vitro and in vivo].","abstract":"Under cultivation of rat peritoneal mesothelial cells in vitro in them there are appeared signs of the genomic instability, evidencing their transformation: increasing of the number of both binucleated cells with micronuclei and polynuclear cells and the increase of sizes and polymorphism. Asbestos greatly accelerates this process. Asbestos-induced carcinogenesis in vivo is accompanied in pleural mesothelium in the rats there also revealed with similar signs of genomic instability and cellular transformation.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051751","annotations":[{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.875478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.84711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.750087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.614257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.606643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Micronucleus","weight":0.554049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronucleus"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.500236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Mesothelium","weight":0.381468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelium"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.1695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Asbestos","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Horticulture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"}]}
