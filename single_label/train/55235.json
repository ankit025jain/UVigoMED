{"id":55235,"title":"Delayed patchy choroidal filling in the Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials (CATT).","abstract":"To determine the relationship between delayed patchy choroidal filling and morphologic and functional outcomes among eyes treated with ranibizumab or bevacizumab.Cohort study.Comparison of Age-related Macular Degeneration Treatment Trials participants were assigned randomly to ranibizumab or bevacizumab on a monthly or as-needed schedule. Presence of delayed patchy choroidal filling and morphologic and functional outcomes were evaluated among eyes with gradable fluorescein angiography at baseline (n = 973) and at 1 year (n = 860) eyes.Delayed filling was present in 75 (7.7%) of 973 eyes at baseline. Eyes with incident delayed filling at 1 year (23 [2.9%] of 798) showed a mean decrease of 1.7 letters in visual acuity, whereas eyes without incident delayed filling had a mean improvement of 8.1 letters (difference [?], -9.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] , -15.8 to -3.9; P < .01). Eyes with incident delayed filling had a larger increase in mean total lesion area of choroidal neovascularization (3.00 mm(2)) than eyes without incident delayed filling (0.56 mm(2); ? , 2.4; 95% CI, 0.4 to 4.4; P = .02). The proportion with incident delayed filling at 1 year was similar among eyes treated with ranibizumab (10 [2.4%] of 413) or bevacizumab (13 [3.3%] of 385; P = .53) and among eyes treated monthly (12 [3.1%] of 388) or as needed (11 [2.7%] of 410; P = .83).Delayed patchy choroidal filling was uncommon at baseline. Although only a small percentage of eyes demonstrated delayed filling during the first year of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment, these eyes had worse visual acuity and a larger increase in total lesion area of choroidal neovascularization.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24949820","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.653074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.583062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.57298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.565619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.545849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.524281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.472889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.285643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.260134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Choroidal neovascularization","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroidal_neovascularization"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.120317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.113728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"410","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/410"},{"name":"798","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/798"},{"name":"860","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/860"},{"name":"388","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/388"},{"name":"973","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/973"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Suplex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cohort (military unit)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Salmson 9","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmson_9"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
