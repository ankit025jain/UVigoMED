{"id":86929,"title":"High prevalence of previous dengue virus infection among first-generation Surinamese immigrants in the Netherlands.","abstract":"A substantial portion of Dutch travellers is comprised of immigrants returning to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFRs), including VFRs returning to dengue-endemic areas such as Suriname. Limited attention has been focused on dengue among immigrants, therefore it is unknown whether immigration has effect on the epidemiology of (severe) dengue among VFRs.To get more insight in the seroprevalence of dengue among Surinamese immigrants, we conducted a seroprevalence study on a convenience sample of first-generation Surinamese immigrants living in the Netherlands.Blood samples were tested for IgG antibodies to DENV antigen serotypes (1, 2, 3 and 4). Gender, age, years lived in Suriname before immigration, history of yellow fever vaccination, and time between yellow fever vaccination and blood sample collection were examined as possible predictors for previous infection.Of the studied 400 Surinamese travellers with a mean age of 52 years (range 18-89), 37% were male. Serology suggestive of past DENV infection was found in 325 individuals (81.3%; 95% CI: 77-85%). The time lived in Suriname before immigration was the only significant predictor for previous DENV infection.Most first-generation Surinamese immigrants have evidence of past DENV infection, probably comparable to Surinamese inhabitants. Whether this influences the number of cases of (severe) dengue when travelling requires more study.","date":"2014-09-18","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25209195","annotations":[{"name":"Yellow fever","weight":0.919068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.71301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.673437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.632976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.569819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Suriname","weight":0.544734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suriname"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.331976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.164836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Dengue virus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_virus"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"1889","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1889"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Yellow","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
