{"id":61096,"title":"[Changes of CD34(+) and CD71(+)CD45(-) cell levels in bone marrow of MDS and AA patients].","abstract":"This study was aimed to investigate the changes of CD34(+) and CD71(+)CD45(-) cell levels in MDS and AA patients. A total of 25 cases MDS and 43 cases of AA (18 cases SAA and 25 cases of NSAA) from January 2010 to October 2013 in the Department of Hematology, affiliated hospital of Hebei United University were enrolled in this study. The complete blood count, bone marrow smears, bone marrow biopsy, karyotype analysis and bone marrow blood cell immune genotyping (mainly the proportion of CD34(+) cells, CD71(+)CD45(-) cells in nucleated cells) were carried out for all patients; the changes of CD34(+) and CD71(+)CD45(-) cell levels in patients with MDS and AA (SAA NSAA) were compared; the differences of white blood cell count, platelet count and hemoglobin concentration in patients with count of CD71(+)CD45(-) ? 15% or <15% were analyzed. The results showed that the count of CD34(+) in MDS group was higher than that in AA (NSAA and SAA) group (P < 0.05). The count of CD71(+)CD45(-) cells in MDS group was higher than that in SAA (P < 0.05), there was no significant difference between NSAA group and MDS group. In MDS group with CD71(+)CD45(-) ? 15%, the platelet count was significantly higher than that in NSAA group (P < 0.05); and there was no statistical difference for leukocyte, platelet count and hemoglobin level between MDS and NSAA group with CD71(+)CD45(-) <15% (P > 0.05). It is concluded that the count of CD34(+) cells in MDS patients is significantly higher than that in AA and SAA patients. The count of CD71(+)CD45(-) cells in MDS group is significantly higher than that of SAA group. The platelet count in MDS patients with CD71(+)CD45(-) cells ? 15% is significantly higher than that of the NSAA group.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763009","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"PTPRC","weight":0.873341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPRC"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Bone marrow examination","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_examination"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.794576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.674674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.670865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.659673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.381224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.323648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.0370354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hebei","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebei"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Count Dracula","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Dracula"}]}
