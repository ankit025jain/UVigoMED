{"id":9248,"title":"Evidence for the use of isoflurane as a replacement for chloral hydrate anesthesia in experimental stroke: an ethical issue.","abstract":"Since an ethical issue has been raised regarding the use of the well-known anesthetic agent chloral hydrate, owing to its mutagenic and carcinogenic effects in animals, attention of neuroscientists has turned to finding out an alternative agent able to meet not only potency, safety, and analgesic efficacy, but also reduced neuroprotective effect for stroke research. The aim of this study was to compare the potential of chloral hydrate and isoflurane for both modulating the action of the experimental neuroprotectant MK801 and exerting analgesia. After middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats, no difference was observed in 24 h survival rate, success of ischemia, or infarct volume reduction between both anesthetics. However, isoflurane exerted a more pronounced analgesic effect than chloral hydrate as evidenced by formalin test 3 hours after anesthesia onset, thus encouraging the use of isoflurane in experimental stroke models.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719888","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.763194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.755043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Formaldehyde","weight":0.725578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.698982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.672044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.336368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Mutagen","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagen"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Chloral hydrate","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloral_hydrate"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Isoflurane","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoflurane"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Neuroscience","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Middle cerebral artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cerebral_artery"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Hydrate","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrate"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Action film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Cerebral arteries","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteries"},{"name":"Voxel-based morphometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel-based_morphometry"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Chloral","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloral"}]}
