{"id":72987,"title":"Metastatic melanoma in the chest and abdomen: the great radiologic imitator.","abstract":"Metastatic melanoma causes an unpredictable variety of manifestations in the chest and abdomen that may be indistinguishable from other diseases by imaging alone. Melanoma metastases commonly involve the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and small bowel, but virtually any organ can be affected. Newer modalities, such as contrast-enhanced ultrasound and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging, may provide more sensitive detection of metastatic melanoma for diagnosis, staging, and surveillance. An understanding of the predominantly hematogenous nature of metastatic spread by melanoma as well as a high index of suspicion in any patient with a history of melanoma may allow for more precise and confident diagnosis.
