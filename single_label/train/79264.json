{"id":79264,"title":"[Expression and significance of phosphated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and p53 protein in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma].","abstract":"To investigate the expression and clinical significance of phosphated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and p53 protein in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), and the relationship between the two genes.Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues, which came from 60 cases of LSCC and 32 samples of normal mucosa over 2.0 cm away from tumor margin in 32 patients with total or subtotal laryngectomy were detected for the expression of p-STAT3 and p53 protein by in SP immunohistochemistry. Micro-image analysis system was used to determine the optical density,and the result was analyzed statistically.There is over expression of p-STAT3 and p53 protein in LSCC. The expression of p-STAT3 and p53 protein in LSCC was associated with clinical stage and lymph nodal metastases (P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the expression of p-STAT3 and P53 protein. The correlation coefficient (r) was 0.6558 (P < 0.01).The expression of p-STAT3 and p53 protein may play an important role in the tumorigenesis,metastases and poor prognosis of LSCC. There was a positive correlation between the over expression of p-STAT3 and p53 protein in LSCC.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459924","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.840325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.828539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.649135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Transducer","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.346431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.151322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Absorbance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance"},{"name":"Laryngectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngectomy"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"}]}
