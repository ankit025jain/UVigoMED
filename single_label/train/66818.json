{"id":66818,"title":"A phase I study of temsirolimus and bryostatin-1 in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma.","abstract":"Temsirolimus, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1, is approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Bryostatin-1 inhibits protein kinase C, a downstream effector of mTOR complex 2. We observed antitumor effects with the combination of temsirolimus and bryostatin-1 in RCC cell lines. METHODS. Four cohorts of patients received weekly bryostatin-1 (20 ?g/m²) with temsirolimus (10, 15, 25, or 37.5 mg) in 28-day cycles.Thirty patients received a total of 138 cycles across four dose levels. Twenty-five patients had RCC (17 clear cell, 7 papillary, and 1 unclassified). Two sarcoma patients with prior cytotoxic therapy experienced dose-limiting toxicity at 15 mg of temsirolimus (grade 3 neutropenia and grade 3 hypophosphatemia). Subsequently, patients with prior cytotoxic therapy were excluded. Two additional dose-limiting toxicities were noted with 37.5 mg of temsirolimus (grade 3 neutropenia and grade 3 creatinine elevation). Consequently, the maximum tolerated dose was defined as temsirolimus at 25 mg and bryostatin-1 at 20 ?g/m² every 28 days. Of the 25 RCC patients, 3 patients had partial responses that lasted for 14 months, 28 months, and ? 80 months, respectively. Partial responses were seen in both clear cell and papillary histology.This combination of 37.5 mg of temsirolimus with 20 ?g/m² of bryostatin-1 was reasonably safe and well tolerated. Durable responses were observed in 3 of 25 patients with RCC.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674872","annotations":[{"name":"Soft-tissue sarcoma","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft-tissue_sarcoma"},{"name":"Protein kinase C","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C"},{"name":"Temsirolimus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temsirolimus"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Bryostatin","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryostatin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.759502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.676941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.60838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.5491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.527163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.516645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.398049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.392511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.343164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.192779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Hypophosphatemia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypophosphatemia"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
