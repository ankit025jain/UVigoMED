{"id":89431,"title":"Principles of comanagement and the geriatric fracture center.","abstract":"This article describes the principles of comanagement in an optimized geriatric fracture center. This is a collaborative model of care that uses patient-centered, protocol-driven care to standardize the care for most patient fragility fractures. This model also uses shared decision making and frequent communication to improve clinically relevant outcomes. The orthopedic and medical teams are equally responsible from admission to discharge and are responsible for daily evaluation and clinical management of the patient.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721359","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.495515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.137589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Pathologic fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture"},{"name":"Shared decision making","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_decision_making"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"}]}
