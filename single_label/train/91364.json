{"id":91364,"title":"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum in an 11-year-old boy after a shallow breath-hold dive.","abstract":"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is caused by pulmonary barotrauma due to transiently increased intra-alveolar and intra-bronchial pressure. The most frequent triggers of spontaneous pneumomediastinum in children are asthma and manoeuvres creating forced expiration. It has been rarely associated with breath-hold diving. Chest pain and dyspnoea are the main symptoms, and the diagnosis can be confirmed by chest X-ray. The treatment of choice is oxygen, analgesics and monitoring the patient. The recurrence rate is low. The main differential diagnoses of spontaneous pneumomediastinum are oesophageal perforation and pericarditis. We report a case of an 11-year-old boy with no substantial medical history, who tried to breath-hold in shallow water for as long as possible. After diving, he felt dyspnoea and chest pain. Chest X-ray revealed pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. The patient was admitted to the PICU for observation and was discharged after two days' follow up. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum in children may be more common than thus far acknowledged. It requires a high index of suspicion and should be considered in all children with acute chest pain.
