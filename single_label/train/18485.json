{"id":18485,"title":"[Compliance with latent tuberculosis treatment: a public health challenge].","abstract":"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major infectious cause of morbidity and mortality, mainly in developing countries. Since the incidence of TB has decreased in the developed countries, the role of diagnosis and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI), has assumed increasing importance as a public health measure to control TB. It is estimated that 5-10% of persons with LTBI go on to develop TB; therefore, the crucial role of LTBI treatment in eliminating TB is well recognized. However, levels of adherence to treatment of LTBI are consistently low, and non-compliance constitutes the major barrier for achieving the full benefits of LTBI treatment, emphasizing the pressing need to implement compliance-enhancing interventions. We present a review of studies in which various interventions aimed at enhancing LTBI treatment adherence were applied.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791558","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.848098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.793624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.771817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.709756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.423861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Latent tuberculosis","weight":0.141968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Diplomatic recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_recognition"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
