{"id":62400,"title":"Constrictive pericarditis caused by immunoglobulin G4-related disease.","abstract":"An 81-year-old man with congestive heart failure was admitted to our hospital. Computed tomography of the chest revealed pericardial thickening without calcification. Ultrasonic echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diastolic dysfunction. Cardiac catheterization showed bilateral elevation of ventricular end-diastolic pressure with a square root sign. The preoperative serum immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) level was abnormally high. Pericardiectomy and pericardiotomy were considered to be indicated and were performed. Histopathologic examination revealed tissue infiltration by IgG4-positive plasma cells, and constrictive pericarditis caused by IgG4-related disease was diagnosed. Postoperatively, the patient received additional corticosteroid therapy. The latest cardiac magnetic resonance image showed further improvement in diastolic function.
