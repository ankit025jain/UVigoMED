{"id":83671,"title":"[The identification and quantitative measurement of mirtazapine isolated from the biological material by high performance liquid chromatography].","abstract":"The present study was designed to estimate the effectiveness of isolation of mirtazapine from the liver, blood, and urine. The conditions were developed for the identification and quantitative measurement of the isolated mirtazapine with the use of high performance liquid chromatography and detection from the UV-spectrum and mass-spectrometry. The retention time of mirtazapine isolated from the liver was 2.88 +/- 0.08 min. The straight-line equation within the range of mirtazapine concentrations from 1 to 20 mc/ml was characterized by the dependence: Y = 3.25 x 10(4)X - 6.27 x 10(3) (r = 0.9997). The study showed that it is possible to isolate 46.44 +/- 1.89% of mirtazapine present in the liver and 50.4 +/- 1.05% from blood using extraction by acetonitrile acidified with an 1 M hydrochloric acid solution. Chloroform extraction from urine at pH 7.0-8.0 releases 90.22 +/- 1.88% of mirtazapine.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275184","annotations":[{"name":"Acetonitrile","weight":0.944133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetonitrile"},{"name":"Hydrochloric acid","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"High-performance liquid chromatography","weight":0.789521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_liquid_chromatography"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.772622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.701299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Chloroform","weight":0.548381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.374911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"Biomass","weight":0.315536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.147995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Mirtazapine","weight":0.114525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtazapine"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Walden inversion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden_inversion"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Yttrium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
