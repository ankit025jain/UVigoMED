{"id":28799,"title":"[Health hazards of energy drinks--the situation in Israel and the world].","abstract":"Since 1987, with the introduction of the first commercial energy drink in Europe, the level of sale of these drinks increased rapidly throughout the western world. These drinks are based on caffeine that is found in them ndependently, and in other ingredients. Other ingredients in these drinks potentiate the effects of caffeine. Caffeine acts in the organism through inhibition and activation of various receptors, and thus affects almost all the body systems. There is an increasing body of evidence about the medical hazards of uncontrolled use of these drinks, with neurologic, psychiatric, cardiovascular and metabolic complications. There is a direct link between use of energy drinks and abuse of alcohol and drugs. Due to the above, health authorities in Israel and around the world have started addressing the regulatory, medical and informative aspects of the issue. In spite all of the above, there is lack of awareness of the public and medical teams about the hazards of cousuming these drinks.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791560","annotations":[{"name":"Caffeine","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.766704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.59783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.523819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.51283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.422533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.284081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.203387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.196893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Energy drink","weight":0.133022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_drink"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.101002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Biological system","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_system"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Ingredient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingredient"},{"name":"1987","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
