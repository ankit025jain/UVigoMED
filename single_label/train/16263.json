{"id":16263,"title":"High resolution melting analysis for the differentiation of Mycobacterium species.","abstract":"A quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) followed by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis was developed for the differentiation of Mycobacterium species. Rapid differentiation of Mycobacterium species is necessary for the effective diagnosis and management of tuberculosis. In this study, the 16S rRNA gene was tested as the target since this has been identified as a suitable target for the identification of mycobacteria species. During the temperature gradient and primer optimization process, the melting peak (Tm) analysis was determined at a concentration of 50 ng DNA template and 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 µM primer. The qPCR assay for the detection of other mycobacterial species was done at the Tm and primer concentration of 62 °C and 0.4 µM, respectively. The HRM analysis generated cluster patterns that were specific and sensitive to distinguished small sequence differences of the Mycobacterium species. This study suggests that the 16S rRNA-based real-time PCR followed by HRM analysis produced unique cluster patterns for species of Mycobacterium and could differentiate the closely related mycobacteria species.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038139","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.723927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.703919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.444226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.422917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Nucleic acid thermodynamics","weight":0.294405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_thermodynamics"},{"name":"16S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.176396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.166355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.159271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.147858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.0472222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Ribosomal DNA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_DNA"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Temperature gradient","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_gradient"},{"name":"Melting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.014492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
