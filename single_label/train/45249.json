{"id":45249,"title":"Analysis of adverse events of bevacizumab-containing systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer in Japan.","abstract":"Bevacizumab (BV) is widely used in chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Although specific adverse events have been observed, their risk factors have not been clarified.178 mCRC patients who underwent chemotherapy were retrospectively examined and correlations between possible risk factors and adverse events were analyzed.87 out of 178 patients were treated with BV-containing chemotherapy. Possible risk factors for BV-related adverse events were: remaining primary tumor, current bleeding, history of arterial thromboembolism (ATE), hypertension, and proteinuria, and these were observed in 22%, 2%, 7%, 16%, and 8% of patients, respectively. Patients with hypertension prior to chemotherapy developed significantly worse hypertension (p=0.018). Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 3 out of 18 patients with residual primary tumor (16.7%) and 6 out of 63 patients with no primary tumor (8.7%) (p=0.385).Pre-existing hypertension appears to be a risk factor for BV-related deterioration of hypertension.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692744","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.797407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.777234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.758148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.746613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.625776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.29465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.209539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.203387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Automatic test equipment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_test_equipment"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Besloten Vennootschap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besloten_Vennootschap"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"}]}
