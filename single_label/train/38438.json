{"id":38438,"title":"Valve-sparing aortic root replacement: early and midterm outcomes in 83 patients.","abstract":"Valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) is an alternative to traditional composite valve graft (CVG) root replacement. We examined early and midterm outcomes after VSARR.A combined retrospective/prospective study was performed in 83 patients who underwent VSARR (16%) among 515 patients who underwent aortic root replacement during a nearly 12-year period. Thirty-six patients (43%) had a connective tissue disorder, 3 patients (4%) had acute aortic dissection, and 40 (48%) patients had at least moderate aortic regurgitation (AR). Twenty-eight patients (34%) had left ventricular hypertrophy or dilatation. The reimplantation VSARR technique was used in 82 patients (99%), and the Florida sleeve technique was used in 1 patient. Thirty-two patients (39%) underwent concomitant aortic arch replacement. For early survivors, the median duration of follow-up was 3.5 years (range, 5 days-12.2 years).One patient had severe AR after VSARR that necessitated intraoperative conversion to a mechanical CVG. The 1 operative death and 1 stroke occurred in a patient with acute dissection. Actuarial survival was 96.4%±2.0% at 2 years and 86.9%±5.6% at 8 years. Six patients (7%) had late valve-related complications: 1 died of endocarditis, 4 underwent reoperation for severe AR and received replacement valves, and 1 had severe AR and is being monitored. Freedom from repair failure (reoperation, endocarditis, or severe AR) was 94.8%±2.6% at 2 years and 87.3%±5.7% at 8 years.Valve-sparing aortic root replacement can have excellent early and respectable midterm outcomes, even when combined with arch repair. Further follow-up remains necessary to evaluate the long-term durability of VSARR.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24424011","annotations":[{"name":"Left ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.803133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Aortic dissection","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_dissection"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Aortic insufficiency","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_insufficiency"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.772903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.741207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.722957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Aortic arch","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_arch"},{"name":"Connective tissue disease","weight":0.655603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue_disease"},{"name":"Ascending aorta","weight":0.552913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_aorta"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.499981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.461506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.208738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.120317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Arkansas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Actuarial science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Sleeve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeve"},{"name":"Computer and Video Games","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_and_Video_Games"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
