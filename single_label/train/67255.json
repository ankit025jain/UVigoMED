{"id":67255,"title":"p66shc and gender-specific dimorphism in acute renal injury.","abstract":"Acute renal injury (AKI) is more prevalent in males than in females perhaps due to adverse effects of testosterone. The oxidant sensor p66shc is regulated by testosterone, hence may be responsible for the aforementioned gender disparity.Wild-type or p66shc-knockdown renal proximal tubule cells were treated with 400 ?M H2O2 in the presence or absence of 100 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT); the production of reactive oxygen species and cell injury were determined. The impact of DHT on p66shc expression and promoter activity as well as gender-dependent expression of p66shc in the mouse kidney was also determined.DHT increased H2O2-dependent oxidative stress and injury via p66shc and expression of p66shc via promoter activation. Renal expression of p66shc was higher in male compared to female kidneys.Higher sensitivity of the male kidney to AKI may be due to the testosterone-dependent increase in p66shc expression.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632974","annotations":[{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Dihydrotestosterone","weight":0.813076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.727627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.711491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.689941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.668418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.629535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Hydrogen peroxide","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.581475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.569226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.428827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.405524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.38687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Proximal convoluted tubule","weight":0.315777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_convoluted_tubule"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Oxidizing agent","weight":0.230631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidizing_agent"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.188635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0606567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Properties of water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"},{"name":"Sex differences in humans","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans"}]}
