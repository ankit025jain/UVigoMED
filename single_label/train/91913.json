{"id":91913,"title":"The epidemiology of life-threatening work-related injury--a demonstration paper.","abstract":"Workers' compensation (WC) data traditionally provides information to stakeholders on work-related disabling injuries. It is important to complement this with information on serious threat to life (TTL) injury, which is the focus of this paper.In this cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological study, based on New Zealand's WC data linked to hospital discharge data, TTL was measured using the ICD10-based Injury Severity Score (ICISS); ICISS???0.941 was used to define serious TTL injury.During 2002-2004, there was an average of 368 serious TTL work-related injury cases annually. The distribution of these injuries was very different from those traditionally found using WC data to describe disabling injury. For example, for serious TTL injury the main injury types included traumatic brain injury, whereas for disabling injury it was sprains and dislocations.The method presented provides the opportunity for government agencies to produce a national description of the epidemiology of serious TTL work-related injuries.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464698","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.82011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.809413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.673874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.495345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"ICD-10","weight":0.20779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.181115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Government agency","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency"},{"name":"Transistor-transistor logic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor-transistor_logic"},{"name":"Injury Severity Score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_Severity_Score"},{"name":"Workers' compensation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_compensation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"941","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/941"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Sprain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprain"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"WC (rapper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WC_(rapper)"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Distribution (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(business)"},{"name":"Protest","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest"},{"name":"Project stakeholder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_stakeholder"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"}]}
