{"id":89853,"title":"Attrition or rupture of digital extensor tendons due to carpal boss: report of 2 cases.","abstract":"We present 2 cases that demonstrate the potential for tendon involvement in the presence of aÂ carpal boss. In the first, a patient presented with tendon rupture without antecedent pain. In the second, pain and tendon irritation prompted magnetic resonance imaging that revealed tendon fraying, which was confirmed at surgery. These cases illustrate the potential for tendinous sequelae of a carpal boss. Advanced imaging may be considered when tendon irritation is clinically suspected. Attention to the possibility of tendon rupture in the setting of an otherwise asymptomatic carpal boss is advised.
