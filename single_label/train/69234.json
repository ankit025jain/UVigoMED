{"id":69234,"title":"IL-22 ameliorates renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by targeting proximal tubule epithelium.","abstract":"IL-22 is an epithelial cell survival cytokine that is currently under development for the treatment of acute liver damage. Here, we used a mouse model of renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury to investigate whether IL-22 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of AKI. The action of IL-22 is mediated by binding to IL-22R1 and leads to STAT3 activation. Under physiologic conditions, renal expression of IL-22R1 was detected only in the brush border of the renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs). Renal I/R elevated serum IL-22 levels slightly but did not induce STAT3 phosphorylation in RPTECs. IL-22-deficient mice had slightly increased I/R-induced injury compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, treatment with IL-22 or overexpression of IL-22 by either gene targeting (IL-22 transgenic mice) or administration of adenovirus expressing IL-22 increased STAT3 phosphorylation in RPTECs, ameliorated I/R-induced renal inflammation and tubular cell injury, and preserved renal functions. Overexpression of IL-22 increased the phosphorylation of STAT3 and Akt, upregulated antiapoptotic genes (e.g., Bcl-2), and downregulated proapoptotic genes (e.g., Bad) in the kidneys of mice subjected to I/R. Notably, phosphorylation of Akt increased and expression of Bad decreased in proximal tubular cells under these conditions. Furthermore, compared with wild-type mice, IL-22 transgenic mice had increased survival rates, whereas IL-22-deficient mice had reduced survival rates after I/R injury. In summary, renal expression of IL-22R1 is restricted to RPTECs, and treatment with IL-22 protects against renal I/R injury by activating STAT3 and AKT, suggesting that IL-22 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of AKI.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459233","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Adenoviridae","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.861965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.828222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Genetically modified organism","weight":0.812922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.739911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Proximal convoluted tubule","weight":0.632556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_convoluted_tubule"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.630015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Gene targeting","weight":0.573109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_targeting"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.522041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.468227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.310622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.308556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.264312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Brush border","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brush_border"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Infrared spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Heterozygote advantage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygote_advantage"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
