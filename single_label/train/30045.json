{"id":30045,"title":"Does dual diagnosis affect violence and moderate/superficial self-harm in heroin addiction at treatment entry?","abstract":"The presence of aggressive and self-harm behaviors is common in heroin-addicted patients, but these frequent co-occurrences have been poorly investigated. Given the fact that self-harm may be seen as both a clear addictive behavior, with its opiate theory, and as part of psychiatric illness, such as psychosis and bipolar spectrum disorders, in this study, we intend to investigate which of the 2 models is more consistent.We compared dual diagnosis with the clinical features of 30 moderate/superficial self-harmed and 162 violent heroin-addicted patients who reported aggressive behavior in the month preceding their request to be treated. As control group, we selected 808 lifetime nonviolent heroin-addicted patients.The presence of a bipolar spectrum diagnosis proved to be the highest risk factor (B = 4.33; exp(B) = 76.52; 95% confidence interval for exp(B) = 35.69-164.04; P < 0.001) for the presence of aggressive behavior (?²= 433.05; df = 5; P < 0.001). The highest risk factor for the presence of moderate/superficial self-harm (?² = 24.83; df = 2; P < 0.001) was a dual diagnosis for chronic psychosis (? = 1.46; exp(B) = 4.34); 95% confidence interval for exp(B) = 1.11-16.98; P < 0.001). The relationships between aggressive and/or self-harm behaviors and the natural history of addiction in heroin-addicted patients seemed to be less consistent.Our data show a frequent co-occurrence of aggression and bipolar spectrum disorder in heroin-addicted patients, which is manifested as aggression directed toward others (violence). On the contrary, self-injurious behavior seems to be strongly correlated with psychotic disorders. Thus, aggressive behavior seems to be correlated, in heroin-addicted patients before entering treatment, with dual diagnosis rather than with a natural history of heroin addiction.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24569303","annotations":[{"name":"Opiate","weight":0.85423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiate"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.840486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Psychosis","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.743483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.703577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Dual diagnosis","weight":0.597982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.523117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.307637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.25896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Bipolar spectrum","weight":0.224236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_spectrum"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.189922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Opioid dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_dependence"},{"name":"Spectrum (psychiatry)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(psychiatry)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Nonviolence","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
