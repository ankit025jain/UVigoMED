{"id":90901,"title":"Secondary trauma and ethical obligations for military psychologists: preserving compassion and competence in the crucible of combat.","abstract":"Current ethical guidelines require psychologists to self-assess competence and take steps to limit or discontinue clinical work when they can no longer render competent care. Yet even in the best of circumstances, human beings--psychologists included--are not very good at evaluating their own performance. Moreover, when psychologists are deployed to combat zones and work constantly with severely traumatized and injured service members, evidence suggests that they become vulnerable to compassion fatigue and secondary trauma syndromes. In this article, we consider the unique threats to competence faced by military clinical psychologists. We conclude with several specific recommendations for deployed military clinical psychologists themselves and for the community leaders tasked with training and supervising them.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564444","annotations":[{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Psychologist","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Compassion","weight":0.368362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.298633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.266487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"United States Armed Forces","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces"},{"name":"Combat","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Compassion fatigue","weight":0.192303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion_fatigue"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Crucible","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible"},{"name":"Competence (human resources)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competence_(human_resources)"},{"name":"Rendering (computer graphics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Vulnerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability"},{"name":"Business ethics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_ethics"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Greatest hits album","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_hits_album"}]}
