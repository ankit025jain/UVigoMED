{"id":33639,"title":"The effects of whole-vault cranioplasty versus strip craniectomy on long-term neuropsychological outcomes in sagittal craniosynostosis.","abstract":"The optimal type of surgical management for isolated sagittal synostosis remains a source of significant debate. There is a paucity of data regarding possible differences in long-term neuropsychological outcomes following treatment with whole-vault cranioplasty or endoscopic strip craniectomy. This study provides the first comparative analysis examining the effects of the two techniques related to long-term intellectual functioning.A total of 70 patients were enrolled in this multicenter study, 29 of whom had previously undergone endoscopic strip craniectomy and 41 of whom had previously undergone whole-vault cranioplasty. All patients completed a battery of neurodevelopmental tests (Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, and Wechsler Fundamentals) to evaluate various domains of neuropsychological function.In a group comparison of those treated before 6 months of age, whole-vault patients obtained higher scores relative to endoscopic strip craniectomy patients on visuomotor integration, full-scale intelligence quotient, verbal intelligence quotient, word reading, and reading comprehension (p < 0.05 for all). When compared against strip craniectomy performed before 3 months of age, the whole-vault group still showed significantly higher scores in verbal intelligence quotient, reading comprehension, and word reading (p < 0.05 for all).The type of surgical intervention for isolated sagittal synostosis impacts long-term neuropsychological outcomes. Patients undergoing early whole-vault cranioplasty attained higher intelligence quotient and achievement scores relative to those undergoing strip craniectomy. Surgical management with whole-vault cranioplasty performed before 6 months of age provides the most favorable long-term intellectual outcomes in patients with isolated sagittal synostosis.Therapeutic, II.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804639","annotations":[{"name":"Intelligence quotient","weight":0.68252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.449947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.351523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Neuropsychology","weight":0.334918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.329958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Craniosynostosis","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniosynostosis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Cranioplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranioplasty"},{"name":"Decompressive craniectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompressive_craniectomy"},{"name":"Synostosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synostosis"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"},{"name":"Intellectual","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual"},{"name":"Word","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Division (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Verbal reasoning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_reasoning"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Abbreviation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Comparative linguistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_linguistics"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Reading comprehension","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_comprehension"}]}
