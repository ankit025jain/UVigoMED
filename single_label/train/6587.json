{"id":6587,"title":"Systemic response to ultraviolet radiation involves induction of leukocytic IL-1? and inflammation in zebrafish.","abstract":"Ultraviolet radiation is a pervasive stimulus with wide-ranging effects on all living forms. The effects of UV vary from physiological to pathological, depending on levels of exposure, but the immune response at the organismal level is not well understood. We use the zebrafish embryo and larva to study immune responses to UV stress in vivo. UV exposure causes inflammation characterized by systemic induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Leukocytes are an important component of this systemic response and upregulate IL-1? expression proportional to the dose of UV exposure. Increased levels of this proinflammatory cytokine counteract the lethal effect of high doses of UV.
