{"id":38293,"title":"[Treatment of neonatal asphyxia with a special focus on therapeutic hypothermia].","abstract":"In recent years the treatment of newborns for neonatal asphyxia has experienced a lot of new developments. A major milestone were the positive results of various trials for prophylactic treatment of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy by moderate cooling of the child or of his head. With this paper we attempt to provide a consented guideline to aid in the treatment decision for affected newborns and thus achieve a more homogeneous treatment strategy throughout Germany.
