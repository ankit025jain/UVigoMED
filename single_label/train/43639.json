{"id":43639,"title":"Survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with 90Y-microsphere radioembolization. Prediction by 18F-FDG PET.","abstract":"This retrospective study aims to evaluate the predictive value of FDG PET/CT in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing radioembolization with yttrium-90 labeled microspheres (RE).The study cohort comprised 33 patients who were treated with RE at our institution and underwent FDG PET/CT at baseline and four weeks after radioembolization. According to the baseline FDG metabolic status of the HCC lesions, patients were divided into two groups: FDG-negative (n = 12) and FDG-positive (n = 21) HCC. FDG-positive patients were further divided into early metabolic responders and non-responders according to the relative change in SUVmax of the treated lesions. Survival analyses were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test, p?<?0.05). Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the influence of prognostic factors on overall survival (OS).FDG-negative patients had a significantly longer OS (13 months, 95%CI 7-19) than FDG-positive patients (9 months, 95%CI 7-11; p = 0.010). Among FDG-positive patients, metabolic responders survived significantly longer than metabolic non-responders (10 months, 95%CI 8-12 vs. 5 months, 95%CI 4-6; p = 0.003). From the other baseline factors (including performance status, hepatic tumour burden, presence of extra-hepatic disease, administered activity) only the BCLC stage had a significant impact on OS (p = 0.028).Pre- and post-therapeutic FDG PET independently predicts overall survival in patients with HCC undergoing radioembolization. Interestingly, early metabolic response seems to be assessable as early as four weeks post-treatment.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777354","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.88562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.664985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.526523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.519125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.497929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.34725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.321849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Yttrium","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"812","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/812"},{"name":"711","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/711"},{"name":"719","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/719"},{"name":"Performance art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_art"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Microsphere","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsphere"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
