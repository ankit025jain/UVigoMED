{"id":19201,"title":"Synthesis and anti-staphylococcal activity of TiO2 nanoparticles and nanowires in ex vivo porcine skin model.","abstract":"Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major causes of skin and soft tissue infections. In this study we compared the antimicrobial activity of two different TiO2 nanoformulations against Staphylococcus aureus. We synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles of approximately 80 nm diameter and TiO2 nanowires of approximately 100 nm diameter. Both nanoformulations possess anti-microbial activity; were non-hemolytic and cytocompatible. However, the anti-staphylococcal activity of TiO2 nanowires was better than the nanoparticles. In broth culture, growth of S. aureus was only partially inhibited by 2% and 4 wt% TiO2 nanoparticles and completely inhibited by TiO2 nanowires till 24 h. TiO2 nanowires treated S. aureus cells exhibits diminished membrane potential than nanoparticle treated cells. The anti-microbial properties of both TiO2 nanoformulations were validated using ex vivo porcine skin model which supplements the in vitro assays. Anti-bacterial activity of the TiO2 nanowires were also validated against multi drug resistant pathogenic strains of S. aureus, showing the clinical potency of the TiO2 nanowires compared to its nanoparticles.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24734539","annotations":[{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.715552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.652619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.55888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.448635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.445374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.352947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.263406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.203387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Titanium dioxide","weight":0.0401361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium_dioxide"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Nanowire","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanowire"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Allopatric speciation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric_speciation"}]}
