{"id":25897,"title":"[Clock genes and circadian rhythm of blood pressure].","abstract":"Cardiovascular function such as blood pressure and heart rate exhibits circadian oscillation. The circadian rhythmicity had been supposed to be regulated by an internal biological. The identification and characterization of mammalian clock genes revealed that the biological clock is composed of feedback loops of transcription factors. Previous studies reported that night shift workers had high risk of ischemic heart disease, suggesting a close association between cardiovascular diseases and circadian rhythm. In addition, recent studies obtained from the genetically engineered mice with disrupted circadian rhythm have revealed that the circadian clock is closely related to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases including hypertension. Understanding the biological relevance of the internal clock in cardiovascular diseases will provide a novel chronotherapeutic approaches to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167735","annotations":[{"name":"Circadian rhythm","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.57921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.437023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.435103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.364692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.36054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Circadian oscillator","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_oscillator"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Clock","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"},{"name":"Shift work","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_work"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
