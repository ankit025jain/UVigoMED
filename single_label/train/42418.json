{"id":42418,"title":"Technical and clinical description of a case of extensive anogenital Paget's disease associated with anal cancer treated by tomotherapy.","abstract":"In this paper we describe a case of extramammary Paget's disease associated with anal cancer, which was successfully treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy using tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost and daily image guidance. The main pitfall in this report is the relatively short follow-up (1 year), which means that the evaluated data is promising but not conclusive. Considering the rarity and wide extension of our patient's Paget's disease in the anogenital region, and the lack of literature reports about curative radiotherapy in this particular setting, this case report may be considered the first related to extensive extramammary Paget's disease treated by tomotherapy.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852874","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.744256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.642344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.555855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.277966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.275612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Anal cancer","weight":0.215812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_cancer"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Tomotherapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomotherapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
