{"id":47508,"title":"[Scope and limitations of minimally invasive resections of the oesophagus and stomach].","abstract":"Although minimally invasive surgery is being increasingly performed for the treatment of upper gastrointestinal cancers, the discussion on potential advantages and oncological accuracy is still controversial.In the framework of a literature survey, current trials on minimally invasive oesophageal resection and laparoscopic abdominal surgery have been analysed.Minimally invasive oesophagectomy and laparoscopic gastric resections for cancer are safe. Minimally invasive resections result in an improved short-term outcome postoperatively in view of less pain, less blood loss and shorter duration of hospital stay. While mortality is equal, morbidity following minimally invasive surgery is reduced. Especially pulmonary complications decrease on the application of minimally invasive oesophagectomy. Minimally invasive operations last longer than open procedures. The oncological results seem to be equal between open and minimally invasive operations. A few studies have shown that laparoscopic gastric resections may result in a reduced number of lymph nodes harvested. The long-term survival between open and laparoscopic resections did not differ in any study.Minimally invasive resections for oesophageal and gastric cancer are safe and show several advantages in short-term outcome. Oncological long-term results seem to be comparable. The potential risk of a reduced number of harvested lymph nodes during laparoscopic gastrectomy has to be addressed by an adequate surgical technique.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585196","annotations":[{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.776875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.754493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.716229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.538817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Abdominal surgery","weight":0.498074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_surgery"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Forestry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
