{"id":78494,"title":"Surgical planning of Isshiki type I thyroplasty using an open-source Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine viewer OsiriX.","abstract":"Preoperative surgical planning of Isshiki type I thyroplasty with the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) viewer OsiriX can be used for strategic and predictable type I thyroplasty.The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of the preoperative planning of type I thyroplasty using the DICOM viewer OsiriX.Five patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis and severe breathy dysphonia were included in this study. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) DICOM data were obtained and breath holding was performed during image acquisition. Using three-dimensional multiplanar reconstruction, we outlined the optimal location for a window. Type I thyroplasty was performed using Isshiki's original method, and only the placement of the window was decided according to the preoperative simulation point. To verify the advantages of this method, we compared our data with the previous data for total operation time and voice quality at 3 months after the operation without the DICOM viewer planning.All patients are free from dysphonia and their glottic closures have resolved satisfactorily. Postoperative CT revealed that appropriate implant positioning resulted in successful surgical intervention. The comparison of total operation time showed that with the new method, operation duration was shortened by 12 min.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646143","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.878028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.667285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.60711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.35839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Vocal cord paresis","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_cord_paresis"},{"name":"DICOM","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM"},{"name":"Dysphonia","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphonia"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Glottis","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.20101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Open source","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0408123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Phonation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonation"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Surgical planning","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_planning"},{"name":"OsiriX","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OsiriX"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Breathy voice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathy_voice"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Closure (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Isshiki, Aichi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isshiki,_Aichi"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Digital imaging","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_imaging"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Window","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"}]}
