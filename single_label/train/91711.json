{"id":91711,"title":"'A child restraint for every child on every trip'.","abstract":"Child passenger injury from road traffic crashes is a leading contributor to New Zealand's paediatric trauma-related mortality and morbidity. New Zealand has significantly higher rates of child passenger injury than internationally comparable countries. Correctly used child restraints can prevent death and severe injury of child passengers. Despite huge efforts by individuals and Non-Government Organisations to promote up-to-date height-based legislation and to distribute child restraints, the New Zealand Government has a tepid commitment to promoting child passenger safety. Further change is needed, in both our child restraint legislation and practice. This paper highlights the recommendations from a Paediatric Society of New Zealand Position Statement for the correct use of child restraints. This information should be used by all health professionals to advocate for and implement this important injury prevention initiative.
