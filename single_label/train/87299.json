{"id":87299,"title":"[Radiomitigators: prospects for use in medical radiation protection].","abstract":"Prospects of creation and use of radiomitigators--the treatment-and-prophylactic means intended for rendering medical care by the victim of influence of ionizing radiation in the earliest terms after irradiation (hours, days) are presented. It is shown that the most effective radiomitigators are found among natural biopolymers of a microbic origin (a vaccine from bacteria of enterotyphus group, preparations of lipopolysaccharide or protein-polysaccharide components of these microbes). Very perspective such preparations as desoxinate, translame and flagellin are represented. The expressed radiomitigate properties such antioxidants as a-tocopherole, xantosine, caffeine, selenium methionine, inosine, guanosine and antioxidant complexes are possess. Among steroids the greatest interest represents 5-androstenediol. Radiomitigate properties have some cytokines, for example interleukine-1beta (betaleukine), trombopoetin, stem cell factor, and also their combination with colony stimulated factors. Tasks of increase of efficiency of medical radiation protection at early stages of a radiation injures are formulated.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286573","annotations":[{"name":"Selenium","weight":0.907507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium"},{"name":"Ionizing radiation","weight":0.875996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"},{"name":"Caffeine","weight":0.861098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.800688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Inosine","weight":0.794766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inosine"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.709644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.60073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Biopolymer","weight":0.446041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopolymer"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.404307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Methionine","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine"},{"name":"Radiation protection","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Flagellin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellin"},{"name":"Stem cell factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_factor"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Guanosine","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine"}]}
