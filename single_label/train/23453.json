{"id":23453,"title":"Laparoscopic appendectomy: State of the art. Tailored approach to the application of laparoscopic appendectomy?","abstract":"Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in developed countries. The treatment of acute appendicitis is either open or laparoscopic appendectomy. The latter has gained wide acceptance in the past years, although the debate on the true merits of laparoscopic appendectomy is still on going. Some authors prefer this approach as the gold standard for all patients, but in our opinion a tailored approach is warranted for specific patient groups. In addition, a standardised guideline on the technical aspects is still lacking. In the current article, open versus laparoscopic appendectomy and several technical aspects, such as stump closure, appendix extraction and single incision are discussed laparoscopic appendectomy are being addressed. In the future perspectives we will briefly discuss the third 'newly' introduced antibiotic treatment.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485267","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.751693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.722248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Appendicitis","weight":0.338889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.301363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Appendectomy","weight":0.202778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendectomy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.129985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vermiform appendix","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermiform_appendix"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.039755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"State of the art","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art"},{"name":"Surgical emergency","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_emergency"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"}]}
