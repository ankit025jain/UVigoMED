{"id":61345,"title":"High prevalence of immunoglobulin light chain gene aberrations as revealed by FISH in multiple myeloma and MGUS.","abstract":"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant B-cell neoplasm characterized by an uncontrolled proliferation of aberrant plasma cells in the bone marrow. Chromosome aberrations in MM are complex and represent a hallmark of the disease, involving many chromosomes that are altered both numerically and structurally. Nearly half of the cases are nonhyperdiploid and show IGH translocations with the following partner genes: CCND1, FGFR3 and MMSET, MAF, MAFB, and CCND3. The remaining 50% are grouped into a hyperdiploid group that is characterized by multiple trisomies involving chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19, and 21. In this study, we analyzed the immunoglobulin light chain kappa (IGK, 2p12) and lambda (IGL, 22q11) loci in 150 cases, mostly with MM but in a few cases monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), without IGH translocations. We identified aberrations in 27% (= 40 patients) including rearrangements (12%), gains (12%), and deletions (4.6%). In 6 of 18 patients with IGK or/and IGL rearrangements, we detected a MYC rearrangement which suggests that MYC is the translocation partner in the majority of these cases.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24729354","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.789555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin light chain","weight":0.785321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.767719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.73874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Myc","weight":0.66619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myc"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.647855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance","weight":0.530807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy_of_undetermined_significance"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.370822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"Cyclin D1","weight":0.256011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D1"},{"name":"IGH@","weight":0.179718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGH@"},{"name":"Gamma globulin","weight":0.152786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_globulin"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor_receptor_3"},{"name":"Cyclin D3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D3"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Lambda phage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_phage"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
