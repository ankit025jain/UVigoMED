{"id":82587,"title":"Perception of graduating medical students on child and maternal oral health in a selected tertiary institution in the southern part of Nigeria.","abstract":"Oral health care imparts on the quality of life and general health outcomes, therefore essential for the knowledge of graduating medical studentsTo assess the knowledge of graduating medical students on child and maternal oral healthA cross sectional survey was undertaken among the graduating medical students of the University of Port Harcourt using an anonymous structured questionnaire with open and closed ended questions. Participants' knowledge about aetiology of dental caries, gingivitis and preventive oral health care and behaviours associated with early childhood caries (ECC) were assessed. Information gathered was collated and analyzed using a statistical software-SPSS Version 17.There were 166 participants with a mean age of 25.4 (+/- 3.0) years, range 20-45 years. Over 80% knew the roles of diet and bacteria in aetiology of dental caries. Regarding ECC, 59% agreed that breast milk and infant formula may be harmful to the teeth and 41.4% were aware that a mother can transmit cariogenic bacteria to the child. The importance of dental check up in pregnancy and the association between oral diseases in pregnant women and infant health was known by 63.3% and 51.8% respectively. Also, the importance of age at first visit and frequency of routine dental visits in a child was known to 40.4% and 54.8% respectively. Only 12.7% of participants knew that a carious primary tooth should be restored. Over 90% agreed that they needed to increase their knowledge on child oral health.The knowledge base of graduating medical students on the subject of maternal and child oral health was inadequate. A curriculum review that accommodates clinical exposure to child and maternal oral health during undergraduate and postgraduate medical residency training in Paediatrics is advised to increase their knowledge.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic
