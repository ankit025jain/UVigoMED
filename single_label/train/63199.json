{"id":63199,"title":"[Apoptosis and neutrophils on the regulation of proliferation and differentiation ex vifo of myeloid cells with Ph-chromosome].","abstract":"Human myeloid cells with Ph chromosome (Ph+ cells) from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the course of proliferation and differentiation ex vivo are regulated under alternation of cell proliferation and neutrophil maturation stages by consecutive blocking and inducing apoptosis with of neutrophils participation as well bcr/abl, bax and bcl2 genes expression. Apoptosis regulation of three main Ph+ cells types from CML patients depends on alternation sequences of proliferation (1) and maturation (2) cell stages and realized by two ways. The first one is performed by consecutive blocking and inducing apoptosis under 2/1/2 stage alternation. The way is not described early. Neutrophils accumulation correlates with apoprosis blocking. Apoptosis level enhances under neutrophils exhausted. Apoptosis blockage allows cells to proliferate and, thus, to form new portion of neutrophils with consecutive regular their death as well a consequent alternation of apoptosis blocking and inducing. This way regulates proliferation efficiency indexes P/D that reflect Ph+ cells proliferating potential and performs cycle completion for proliferation and differentiation. The second way of apoptosis regulation starts from proliferation stage and performs for 1/2/1 alternations under diminished content of neutrophils and a little increase under next maturation. It leads to resistant depressed apoptosis levels that, at maximal points, are 3-8 times lower than those under alternation 2/1/2. Resistant apoptosis blocking is observed in the Ph+ cells with prolong proliferation or maturation stages, when blasts and myelosytes are accumulated under enhanced bcr/abl and bcl2 > box gene expression and remain under next maturation. Stable apoptosis blocking is accompanied by increasing amounts of blasts and myelocytes and enhancing bcr/abl and bcl 2 > bax expression. This is observed under CML progression. Ph+ cells cultivation may be useful for more distinct diagnostics of CML phases of individual CML patients and optimization of the treatment.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466754","annotations":[{"name":"Philadelphia chromosome","weight":0.89695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_chromosome"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.817416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.649237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.615908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Myelocyte","weight":0.510477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelocyte"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.508618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.485739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.39426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.380451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.288149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Horticulture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Alternation of generations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternation_of_generations"}]}
