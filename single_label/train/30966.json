{"id":30966,"title":"ASHP Statement on the pharmacist's role in substance abuse prevention, education, and assistance.","abstract":"The American Society of Health- System Pharmacists (ASHP) believes that pharmacists have the unique knowledge, skills, and responsibilities for assuming an important role in substance abuse prevention, education, and assistance. Pharmacists, as health care providers, should be actively involved in reducing the negative effects that substance abuse has on society, health systems, and the pharmacy profession. Further, ASHP supports efforts to rehabilitate pharmacists and other health-system employees whose mental or physical impairments are caused by substance abuse.","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24429020","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.816307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.61766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.489597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Health system","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.398527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.366738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.311393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.256917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.212661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Substance abuse prevention","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse_prevention"}]}
