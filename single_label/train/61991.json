{"id":61991,"title":"[Anemia in the critically ill child and adult: a narrative review].","abstract":"Anemia is frequent in the pediatric and adult intensive care unit. Anemia decreases oxygen transport which can be harmful in the critically ill patient; it is independently associated with a poor prognosis. The major prophylactic measure against anemia is the limitation of blood draws: several approaches can be used to limit phlebotomy overdraw without harming the patient. Red blood cell transfusion is the quickest way to increase the hemoglobin level, but it is not without risk. It is therefore important to promote the use of evidence-based transfusion strategies. Iron could be useful in case of iron deficiency, but this condition is difficult to diagnose in the critically ill patient. Erythropoietin is no longer relevant in the intensive care unit in the era of restrictive transfusion practice, at least for its hematological effects. Several questions remain to be addressed in order to improve anemia management in the intensive care unit.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640305","annotations":[{"name":"Erythropoietin","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.859022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.720725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Respiration (physiology)","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.686872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Iron deficiency (medicine)","weight":0.649135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.539484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.528221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.473217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.421785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.40717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Phlebotomy","weight":0.189624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlebotomy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Narrative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
