{"id":78694,"title":"Management of subglottic hemangioma with propranolol.","abstract":"Subglottic hemangioma is a rare but life- threatening condition which requires intervention. It generally starts proliferating in the first and second months of lifespan and whether there is a respiration problem or not, it causes biphasic stridor. Its diagnosis generally requires direct laryngoscopy or direct screening through bronchoscopy. This case report presents a 45-day-old girl who had subglottic hemangioma presenting with wheezing and stridor. Our case took propranolol with a dose of 2 mg/kg/day and within 48 h after the start of the treatment, obstructive symptoms started to alleviate considerably.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602457","annotations":[{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Propranolol","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propranolol"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.584469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Respiration (physiology)","weight":0.339985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)"},{"name":"Wheeze","weight":0.339581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeze"},{"name":"Stridor","weight":0.266208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stridor"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glottis","weight":0.122221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Starting pitcher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
