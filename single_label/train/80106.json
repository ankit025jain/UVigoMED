{"id":80106,"title":"[Effects of molluscicides at different environments on Oncomelania hupensis snail control in Danyang City].","abstract":"To evaluate the effects of continuous application of niclosamide ethanolamine salt on Oncomelania hupensis snail control in a marshland, river and channel.The Beiwei marshland in Houxiang Town, the Xiaoliang River in Lingkou Town and Laomiao channel in Yunyang Town in Danyang City were selected as study sites, and 4% niclosamide ethanolamine salt and 26% niclosamide powder were used to kill the snails. Based on the historical records and field investigations, the effects of continuous application of niclosamide ethanolamine salt on snail control were evaluated.Compared with the first time of snail repetition, the snail areas decreased by 82.80%, 63.14% and 70.00% in the Beiwei marshland, Xiaoliang River and Laomiao channel, respectively, in 2013. There was a positive correlation between the area and density of snails (r = 0.931, 0.975 and 0.916, respectively; all P values < 0.05). The average densities of living snails decreased significantly by 92.34%, 87.91% and 97.66%, respectively. There was a negative correlation between the corrected mortality of snails and the average density of living snails in the following year, and a negative correlation between the reduction rate of living snail density and the average density of living snails in the following year.Molluscicides plays an important role in compressing the snail area, reducing the snail density, and controlling the schistosomiasis transmission.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800569","annotations":[{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.783055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"History","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.396163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.238043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.142583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"River","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.124413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Marsh","weight":0.121805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Ethanolamine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanolamine"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Niclosamide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niclosamide"},{"name":"Danyang, Jiangsu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danyang,_Jiangsu"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"931","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/931"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"975","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/975"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Gear ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_ratio"},{"name":"Channel (geography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(geography)"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Gunpowder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder"},{"name":"Mass production","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Yunyang County","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunyang_County"}]}
