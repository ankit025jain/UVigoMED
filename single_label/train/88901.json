{"id":88901,"title":"Ionising radiation exposure in paediatric trauma.","abstract":"Trauma remains the highest cause of paediatric morbidity and mortality. These trauma patients incur radiation exposure during intraoperative management. Medical personnel have the responsibility to ensure observation of the 'as low as reasonably achievable' principle, a practice mandate that minimises ionising radiation exposure. The aim of this study was to quantify the difference in the amount of ionising radiation used by operating surgeons of different grades in paediatric trauma surgery.Intraoperative imaging in paediatric trauma surgery between 2008 and 2010 at a UK trauma centre was analysed retrospectively, recording injury demographics, surgeon grade, radiation exposure (dose area product [DAP]) and screening time. A mobile image intensifier was used in all cases and the lowest dose rate was selected for all screening.A total of 782 trauma cases were analysed: 304 procedures (39%) were carried out by consultants, 127 (16%) by senior registrars and 351 (45%) by junior registrars. The mean screening time for consultants was 0.23 minutes (standard deviation [SD]: 0.21 minutes) while for senior registrars it was 0.24 minutes (SD: 0.27 minutes) and for junior registrars 0.47 minutes (SD: 1.5 minutes). The mean DAP for consultants was 58.49Gycm(2) (SD: 53.66Gycm(2)). For senior registrars it was 87.2Gycm(2) (SD: 126.64Gycm(2)) and for junior registrars it was 90.46Gycm(2) (SD: 180.02Gycm(2)). This equates to a 51% increase in screening time and a 35% increase in DAP by a junior registrar compared with a consultant.Significantly lower screening times and radiation exposure was found in procedures performed by consultants compared with registrars (p<0.001). Given the harmful and unknown long-term effects of ionising radiation exposure in children, we recommend increasing consultant presence in paediatric trauma theatres.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780781","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma
