{"id":16782,"title":"Of worms and men: HLH-30 and TFEB regulate tolerance to infection.","abstract":"In this issue of Immunity, Visvikis et al. (2014) use the model host Caenorhabditis elegans to discover a role in innate immunity for the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, HLH-30. The finding inspires study of the mammalian ortholog TFEB, in which a similar role in immune response is ascertained.
