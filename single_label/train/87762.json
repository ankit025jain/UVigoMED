{"id":87762,"title":"Physical examination of the patellofemoral joint.","abstract":"Examination of the patellofemoral joint can prove to be challenging. Although certain acute injuries such as patella fracture or tendon rupture can be diagnosed quickly, more chronic injuries such as patellar subluxation and patellofemoral pain syndrome are more difficult to diagnose because of the subtlety of the examination findings. The source of the problem can also vary, and must be identified to direct treatment. Adding to the complexity is that other structures around the knee may present with anterior knee pain and can be mistaken for patellofemoral disorder, which is why the patellofemoral examination should be performed in the context of a complete knee examination. For all of these reasons, performing a thorough and systematic examination of the patellofemoral joint can lead to optimal outcomes for patients.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993407","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.604105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.533261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.466177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Subluxation","weight":0.455396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subluxation"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.451152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.112892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Knee examination","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_examination"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Patella fracture","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella_fracture"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Patellofemoral pain syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellofemoral_pain_syndrome"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Knee pain","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_pain"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"BMC B-Series engine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMC_B-Series_engine"}]}
