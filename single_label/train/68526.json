{"id":68526,"title":"Albumin adsorption onto surfaces of urine collection and analysis containers.","abstract":"Adsorption of albumin onto urine collection and analysis containers may cause falsely low concentrations.We added (125)I-labeled human serum albumin to urine and to phosphate buffered solutions, incubated them with 22 plastic container materials and measured adsorption by liquid scintillation counting.Adsorption of urine albumin (UA) at 5-6 mg/l was <0.9%; and at 90 mg/l was <0.4%. Adsorption was generally less at pH8 than pH5 but only 3 cases had p<0.05. Adsorption from 11 unaltered urine samples with albumin 5-333 mg/l was <0.8%. Albumin adsorption for the material with greatest binding was extrapolated to the surface areas of 100 ml and 2l collection containers, and to instrument sample cups and showed <1% change in concentration at 5 mg/l and <0.5% change at 20 mg/l or higher concentrations. Adsorption of albumin from phosphate buffered solutions (2-28%) was larger than that from urine.Albumin adsorption differed among urine samples and plastic materials, but the total influence of adsorption was <1% for all materials and urine samples tested. Adsorption of albumin from phosphate buffered solutions was larger than that from urine and could be a limitation for preparations used as calibrators.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513540","annotations":[{"name":"PH","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.738571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.69084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.682669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Adsorption","weight":0.664199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.41426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.319585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Human serum albumin","weight":0.310456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_serum_albumin"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.251073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Buffer solution","weight":0.0678259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution"},{"name":"Liquid scintillation counting","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_scintillation_counting"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"228","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/228"},{"name":"Counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting"},{"name":"Extrapolation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation"},{"name":"Packaging and labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"}]}
