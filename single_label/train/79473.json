{"id":79473,"title":"[Clinical analysis of in-patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome].","abstract":"This study is to investigate the clinical materials of in-patients with the large vestibular aqueduct syndrome (LVAS), and explore the feature, diagnosis and treatment measures of the disease.A retrospective review was conducted including the medical history, audiological examinations, vestibular function examinations, imaging examinations and treatment methods of 44 in patients (87 ears) suffering LVAS admitted to our hospital in the past 4 years(from 2008 to 2012).ln the 44 in patients, there were 24 male cases and 20 female cases, and the male-female ratio was 1.2 :1. The average of the onset age was 3.39 years. Five cases (11. 36%) had related familial history. The profound hearing loss was found in 67 ears (77.01%), and the severe hearing loss was found in 20 ears (22.99%). After systemic treatment,the hearing of 38 ears improved effectively,but that of 49 ears did not improve obviously. The analysis found that patients suffering sudden hearing loss got better curative effect than those with progressive hearing loss. Patients received combined drug therapy improving arterial circulation as well as venous reflux got better therapeutic effect. There was a significant difference on effect between the patients with course of treatment more than 7 days and those less than 7 days. There was no significant correlation between therapeutic effect and other factors.In part of LVAS patients,the hearing level can be effectively improved through a standard internal medicine treatment. We can improve the personalized and standardized treatment strategy for this disease through analysis of diagnosis and treatment of in-patients with complete clinical data.","date":"2014-01-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417164","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Internal medicine","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.793177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.768176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.692953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.677627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.533153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.442089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Aqueduct","weight":0.357569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueduct"},{"name":"Audiology","weight":0.320616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.222685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"History","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Personalized medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine"}]}
