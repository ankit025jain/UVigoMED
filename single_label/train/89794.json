{"id":89794,"title":"Primary versus revision arthroscopic reconstruction with remplissage for shoulder instability with moderate bone loss.","abstract":"This study aims to evaluate our outcomes of arthroscopic remplissage in this setting.A retrospective review was performed to identify patients who underwent arthroscopic remplissage of an engaging Hill-Sachs lesion along with anterior capsulolabral reconstruction for anterior glenohumeral instability with moderate glenohumeral bone loss at our institution. Thirty-five patients, with a minimum of 2 years' follow-up, were identified. We assessed the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, incidence of recurrent instability, and postoperative Rowe instability score.Follow-up was available for 30 patients (31 shoulders). The mean age was 24.6 years, with a mean follow-up period of 41 months. Prior instability surgery had failed in 11 patients, and they underwent capsulolabral reconstruction and remplissage (\"revision surgery\"). The failure rate in revision cases (36%) was significantly higher than the failure rate in primary surgery cases (0%) (P = .01). Failure resulted from trauma in all 4 patients, and none required further surgery. The mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score for all patients improved from 50 preoperatively to 91 postoperatively (P < .001), with no significant postoperative difference between primary and revision patients (P = .13). The patients with clinical failure showed nonsignificant improvement from 41 preoperatively to 72 postoperatively (P = .08). The mean postoperative Rowe score for the entire cohort was 90. The Rowe score was significantly lower in the 4 cases of failure than in the 27 non-failure cases (51 v 96, P < .001).In our experience, aggressive capsulolabral reconstruction with remplissage in traumatic instability patients with moderate bone loss and engaging humeral Hill-Sachs lesions yields acceptable outcomes for primary instability surgery. However, a significantly higher failure rate occurred when arthroscopic reconstruction with remplissage was performed in the revision setting.Level IV, therapeutic case series.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680304","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.662366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.530951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.473927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.397521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.3225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.29946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.262707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Glenohumeral joint","weight":0.166125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral_joint"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.102441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Dislocated shoulder","weight":0.0317028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocated_shoulder"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Failure (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_(band)"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Shoulders","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulders"},{"name":"Yield (wine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(wine)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Rowe, Massachusetts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowe,_Massachusetts"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Radial recurrent artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_recurrent_artery"}]}
