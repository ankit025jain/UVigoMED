{"id":92468,"title":"Dynamic KINE-MRI in patellofemoral instability in adolescents.","abstract":"The impact of kinematic MRI (KINE-MRI) in the patellofemoral instability and anterior knee pain of the adolescents is rarely reported. Our special interest was to evaluate the patellofemoral joint biomechanics with KINE-MRI in adolescents with affected and unaffected knees in a case-control study.KINE-MRI was performed in 29 adolescents (affected knee group, n = 29 and unaffected knee group, n = 26) aged 11-16 years with unilateral patellofemoral instability. For the control group, we enrolled ten healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers (healthy knee group, n = 19). The study parameters, bisect offset, lateral patellar displacement, patellar tilt angle, sulcus angle and Insall-Salvati ratio at 0, 10, 20 and 30° of flexion-extension, were measured for the affected knee patients (n = 29), unaffected knee patients (n = 26) and the healthy knee subjects (n = 19).The affected knee and the healthy knee subjects had a significant difference in the bisect offset ratio, lateral patellar displacement test and patellar tilt angle test. In these parameters, the difference between the affected knee patients and the healthy knee subjects progressively increased towards the full extension of the knee. In the affected knee and unaffected knee patients, bisect offset ratio at 0° ranged between 0.50 and 1.20 in both groups, whereas the bisect offset ratio in the healthy knee subjects ranged between 0.33 and 0.75 (p < 0.001). At the 0°, the lateral patellar displacement test ranged between 0 and 10 mm in the affected knee patients and between 0 and 35 mm in the unaffected knee patients, whereas the lateral displacement test ranged between 0 and 5 mm in the healthy knee subjects (p = 0.003). Patellar tilt angle test ranged between -30 and 20° in the affected knee patients and between -30 and 24° in the unaffected knee patients, and in the healthy knee subjects, the patellar tilt angle test ranged between 10 and 24° (p < 0.001).The KINE-MRI was able to detect significant differences in patellofemoral joint kinematics between the patients and the healthy subjects. A new finding with clinical relevance in our work is that the unaffected knee is very similar to the dislocated knee in adolescents and this should be taken in account in rehabilitation of patients.II.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24045916","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.760996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.703812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.683009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Kinematics","weight":0.477536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.178984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.167804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Knee pain","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_pain"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.0699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"35 mm film","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_film"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"1116","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1116"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Special Interest Group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Interest_Group"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Sulcus (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulcus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Lithography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
