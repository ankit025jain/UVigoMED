{"id":39137,"title":"Evaluation of paraoxonase and arylesterase activities in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.","abstract":"The aims of the present study were to evaluate oxidative status, by investigating the serum Paraoxonase/Arylesterase (PON/ARE) activities along with conjugated dienes in patients with IBS and controls and to confirm the link between oxidative stress and IBS. Thirty IBS patient and 30 healthy subjects were recruited. Total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides (TG), PON and ARE activities and conjugated dienes levels were measured. Mean serum PON1 activity was lower in IBS group compared to that of the control group whereas there was no significant difference in ARE activity between IBS and control groups (p < 0.000, p < 0.716, respectively). Serum conjugated diene levels of the IBS group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.01). The drop in PON activity accompanied with an increase in conjugated diene levels indicate the presence of oxidative stress, a disturbance in prooxidant - antioxidant balance and increased inflammation in IBS patients.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25255593","annotations":[{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.909966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.805308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.795781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.717586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Pro-oxidant","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-oxidant"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0738637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diene"},{"name":"Paraoxonase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraoxonase"},{"name":"PON1","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PON1"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"716","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/716"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Passive optical network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"}]}
