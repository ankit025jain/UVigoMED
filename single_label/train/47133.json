{"id":47133,"title":"Indeterminate RIBA results were associated with the absence of hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV-RNA) in blood donors.","abstract":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is diagnosed by the presence of antibodies and is supplemented by confirmatory testing methods, such as recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) and HCV-RNA detection. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of RIBA testing to diagnose HCV infection in blood donors positive for anti-HCV antibodies.A total of 102 subjects positive for anti-HCV determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at the Hematology and Hemotherapy Foundation of Bahia (HEMOBA) were later assessed with new samples using the Abbott Architect anti-HCV test (Abbott Diagnostics, Wiesbaden, Germany), the RIBA III test (Chiron RIBA HCV 3.0 SIA, Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA, USA), the polymerase chain reaction (PCR; COBASÂ® AMPLICOR HCV Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN, USA) and line probe assay (LiPA - Siemens, Tarrytown, NY, USA) genotyping for HCV diagnosis.Of these new samples, 38.2% (39/102) were positive, 57.8% (59/102) were negative and 3.9% (4/102) were indeterminate for anti-HCV; HCV-RNA was detected in 22.5% (23/102) of the samples. RIBA results were positive in 58.1% (25/43), negative in 9.3% (4/43) and indeterminate in 32.6% (14/43) of the samples. The prevailing genotypes were 1 (78.3%, 18/23), 3 (17.4%, 4/23) and 2 (4.3%, 1/23). All 14 samples with indeterminate RIBA results had undetectable viral loads (detection limit ?50 IU/mL). Of these samples, 71.4% (10/14) were reevaluated six months later. Eighty percent (8/10) of these samples remained indeterminate by RIBA, and 20% (2/10) were negative.In this study, individuals with indeterminate RIBA results had no detectable HCV-RNA.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603731","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.766265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.757491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.499217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.467719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.457549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.407173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.352377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Emeryville, California","weight":0.298425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeryville,_California"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chiron Corporation","weight":0.0496211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiron_Corporation"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hoffmann-La Roche","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoffmann-La_Roche"},{"name":"Indiana","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana"},{"name":"Wiesbaden","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiesbaden"},{"name":"Siemens","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens"},{"name":"Roche Diagnostics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_Diagnostics"},{"name":"Indianapolis","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis"},{"name":"Abbott Laboratories","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Laboratories"},{"name":"Architect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"}]}
