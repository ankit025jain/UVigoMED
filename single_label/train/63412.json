{"id":63412,"title":"Managing Hodgkin lymphoma relapsing after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation: a not-so-good cancer after all!","abstract":"Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) relapsing after an autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) poses a therapeutic challenge. In this setting, salvage chemotherapy (for example, gemcitabine-based, ifosfamide-containing and others) or immunotherapy (for example, brentuximab vedotin) is essential as a bridging-cytoreduction strategy to an allogeneic HCT. Myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in relapsed HL is associated with high rates of non-relapse mortality. In carefully selected patients with chemosensitive disease, allografting following lower-intensity conditioning regimens can provide durable disease control rates of about 25-35%. Promising early results with haploidentical and umbilical cord transplantation are noteworthy and are expanding this procedure to patients for whom HLA-matched related or unrelated donors are not available. Unfortunately, a significant number of HL patients relapsing after an autologous HCT are not candidates for allografting because of the presence of resistant disease, donor unavailability or comorbidities. Brentuximab vedotin is approved for HL relapsing after a prior autograft. Rituximab and bendamustine are also active in this setting, albeit with short durations of remission. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (for example, panobinostat, mocetinostat), mTOR inhibitors (for example, everolimus) and immunomodulatory agents (lenalidomide) have shown activity in phase II trials, but currently are not approved for this indication. Second autologous HCT are rarely performed but this approach should not be considered standard practice at this time. The need for effective agents for post autograft failures of HL largely remains unmet. Continuous efforts to ensure early referral of such patients for allogeneic HCT or investigational therapies are the key to improving outcomes of this not-so-good lymphoma.
