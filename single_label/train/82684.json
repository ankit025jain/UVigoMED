{"id":82684,"title":"Characteristics of hospitalizations attributed to herpetic gingivostomatitis: analysis of nationwide inpatient sample.","abstract":"Herpetic gingivostomatitis (HGS) is a prevalent oral condition of viral origin. Some patients with HGS visit emergency departments for treatment. This study is aimed at determining the nationwide estimates of hospitalizations due to HGS in the United States.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was used for the years 2004 to 2010. Hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of HGS were identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9-CM code 054.2.During the study period, a total of 12 536 hospitalizations were attributed to HGS, and the number of hospitalizations per year (mean, 1791) remained fairly constant during the years examined. The median age was 3.2 years. The mean age (15.6 years for the overall period) ranged from a low of 15.2 in 2010 to a high of 16.8 in 2007. The total charges that resulted from these hospitalizations were $229.4 million.This study further confirms that substantial resources are spent in treating oral conditions in hospital settings.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560407","annotations":[{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.788287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.66509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.648886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.455375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.366363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.311657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_for_Healthcare_Research_and_Quality"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.120866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Herpes labialis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_labialis"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"1791","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1791"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"536","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/536"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"HGS (gene)","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HGS_(gene)"}]}
