{"id":35384,"title":"Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease in an Algerian population.","abstract":"There is growing evidence that increased blood concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study was conducted to evaluate the association of serum tHcy and other biochemical risk factors with AD.This is a case-control study including 41 individuals diagnosed with AD and 46 nondemented controls. Serum levels of all studied biochemical parameters were performed.Univariate logistic regression showed a significant increase of tHcy (p = 0.008), urea (p = 0.036) and a significant decrease of vitamin B12 (p = 0.012) in AD group vs. controls. Using multivariate logistic regression, tHcy (p = 0.007, OR = 1.376) appeared as an independent risk factor predictor of AD. There was a significant positive correlation between tHcy and creatinine (p <0.0001). A negative correlation was found between tHcy and vitamin B12 (p <0.0001).Our findings support that hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for AD in an Algerian population and is also associated with vitamin B12 deficiency.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656904","annotations":[{"name":"Urea","weight":0.865113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vitamin B12","weight":0.667324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.64952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Homocysteine","weight":0.634441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.57147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.479775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Hyperhomocysteinemia","weight":0.23109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhomocysteinemia"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Demographics of Algeria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Algeria"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Vitamin B12 deficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12_deficiency"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
