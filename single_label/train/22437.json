{"id":22437,"title":"[Prospects for the renovation of the medical system for tuberculosis and human resource development in the near future].","abstract":"The status of tuberculosis (TB) in Japan was changed to decline and decreased dramatically after The World War II with the great nationwide efforts. Along with the decrease of TB people's attentions to tuberculosis has been reducing significantly, including the medical personnel. In the 1990s, TB returned to increase again, then Emergency Declaration against TB by Minister of Health and Welfare in 1999 drew the public attentions to TB again. Unfortunately, however, there have been many hospitals that cannot deal with TB properly. On the other hand, non-tuberculous mycobacteriosis (NTM) is increasing recently, which bothers many physicians or pulmonologists. \"Japanese Respiratory Society\" (JRS) was founded as \"Japan Society of Chest Diseases\" derived from \"Japanese Society for Tuberculosis\" (JSTB) in 1961, when almost all the members were the members of both the Societies. Now, after 50 years of JRS foundation, only one in four members of JRS may join to JSTB. However, the needs for training opportunities about TB and NTM do exist indeed, which is suggested by the fact that \"Tuberculosis course\", the joint program with JSTB, held in every annual JRS meeting has been filled with a lot of standing audience. In order to support these needs for training about TB, JSTB began the Certification System for TB and NTM in 2011. More than 1,000 certified physicians were born so far. In addition, the decreased number of JSTB members has returned to increase significantly. The most important challenge is to make a future countermeasure against TB and NTM, and also to promote the development of human resources based on the current situation and forecast of TB. This symposium was planned along the theme of this congress, \"TB control for the next generation\" in response to the wishes of the Congress President Dr. Yamagishi. On behalf of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Dr. Yoshizawa talked about the future measures and challenges, and the human resource development for the future, based on the current situation of the medical system for tuberculosis. Dr. Fujita, the chairman of the committee of the certification system, talked about the JSTB Certification System, and the prospect of the human resource development. Dr. Nagai talked about the training opportunities for TB and NTM such as the \"Educational seminar\" in the annual meeting of JSTB or the \"Tuberculosis course\" in the annual meeting of JRS. Nurse and the Public health nurse are also the important members of the medical team for TB. Ms. Nagata talked about the human resources development of nurse responsible for tuberculosis care. Finally, Dr. Kudo, who originally proposed the JSTB Certification System as the chairman of the future planning committee, addressed the history and the foresights of the near future medical care system for TB as a special remark. We wish all the members may share the prospects of future medical care for TB and NTM, which may help for improving the future medical system.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections
