{"id":27774,"title":"[Analyze causes of adverse reactions induced by traditional Chinese medicine injections from its quality standards].","abstract":"Reviewing the literatures about adverse reactions induced by traditional Chinese medicine injections (TCMI) reported on CNKI from 1983 to 2013. Analyzing the causes of adverse reactions induced by TCMI from its quality standards. Provide ideas for improving security of TCMI and completing its quality standards. This review indicates that TCMI-induced adverse reactions have little relationship with the number of compositions, but have tight connection with chemical ingredients and solvents. Adverse reactions can be decreased by perfecting the quality standards of TCMI.","date":"2014-09-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25204194","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.883045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.498854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"China","weight":0.274917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"},{"name":"Solvent","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"},{"name":"Ingredient","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingredient"},{"name":"Security","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security"},{"name":"The Children's Museum of Indianapolis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Children's_Museum_of_Indianapolis"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"1983","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"}]}
