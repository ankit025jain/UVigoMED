{"id":12740,"title":"In vivo investigation of calcium phosphate coatings on Ti6-Al-4V alloy substrates using lactic acid - sodium lactate buffered synthetic body fluid.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the mode of failure and biomechanical characteristics of Ti-6Al-4V anchors biomimetically coated with calcium phosphate (CaP) for soft tissue fixation to bone in an animal model.The current study included 14 adult New Zealand white rabbits equally divided into two groups. Calcium phosphate-coated Ti-6Al-4V anchors were used in the test group and non-coated Ti-6Al-4V anchors in the control group. A new approach was applied to synthesize the CaP coatings via the biomimetic growth in the Lac-SBF containing Ca(2+) and PO4(3-) ions, Na-lactate and lactic acid (HL). Titanium anchors were implanted into the right tibia, followed by biomechanical tensile strength tests. Histological studies were carried out after removal of anchors (bone-implant surface).The CaP-coated Ti-6Al-4V anchors had significantly higher tensile strength (p=0.003) and displacement values (p=0.004) than the non-coated anchors. Control group scores were higher than those of the test group (14 and 9, respectively) in tensile strength tests.The new CaP coating can be used in orthopedic surgery as catalyzer to improve bone ingrowth. We believe that our research will form a model for further research on biomimetic coatings on Ti-6Al-4V substrates.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509222","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.912788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Calcium phosphate","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.752008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.736569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.729417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Body fluid","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fluid"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.700903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Alloy","weight":0.682667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.661005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.639889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.56893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.561534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bionics","weight":0.560345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionics"},{"name":"Buffer solution","weight":0.556565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution"},{"name":"Ultimate tensile strength","weight":0.537894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.477849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.441745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.437363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.243798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Carbon group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_group"},{"name":"Sodium lactate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_lactate"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Hull (watercraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_(watercraft)"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Holdfast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holdfast"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"}]}
