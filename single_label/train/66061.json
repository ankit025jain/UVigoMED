{"id":66061,"title":"Is regenerative medicine a new hope for kidney replacement?","abstract":"The availability of kidney and other organs from matching donors is not enough for many patients on demand for organ transplant. Unfortunately, this situation is not better despite the many of new interesting projects of promoting family, cross or domino transplants. These inexorable global statistics forced medical researchers to find a new potential therapeutic option that would guarantee safety and efficacy for the treatment of ESRD comparable to kidney transplantation. The aim of our review is to summarize the scientific literature that relating to the modern as well as innovative experimental methods and possibilities of kidney regeneration and, in addition, to find whether the regenerative medicine field will be a new hope for curing the patient with renal disease complications. The most important achievements in the field of regenerative medicine of kidney, which were mentioned and described here, are currently cumulated in 4 areas of interest: stem cell-based therapies, neo-kidneys with specially designed scaffolds or cell-seeded matrices, bioartificial kidneys and innovative nanotechnologically bioengineered solutions. Nowadays, we can add some remarks that the regenerative medicine is still insufficient to completely replace current therapy methods used in patients with chronic kidney disease especially with the end-stage renal disease where in many cases kidney transplantation is the only one chance. But we think that development of regenerative medicine especially in the last 20Â years brings us more and more closer to solve many of today's problems at the frontier of nephrology and transplantology.
