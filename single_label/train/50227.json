{"id":50227,"title":"Sialic acid methylation refines capillary electrophoresis laser-induced fluorescence analyses of immunoglobulin G N-glycans of ovarian cancer patients.","abstract":"Alterations in IgG N-glycosylation coincide with the development of a number of diseases including cancer and could potentially be used as diagnostic markers. CE-LIF of 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid labeled N-glycans is a well-established rapid method to characterize IgG N-glycans that needs only low amounts of starting material. However,sialylated N-glycans have short migration times due to their negative charge. As a result,some of them are not well resolved and co-migrate with neutral glycans. In this work, we neutralized the negative charge of sialic acids by methylation and optimized the protocol using the commercially available disialylated biantennary oligosaccharide (A2G2S2). IgGN-glycans isolated from healthy human serum were then analyzed using this method. We could demonstrate that co-migration of A2, FA2G2S1, and FA2B[3]G1S1 was prevented,which allowed an accurate quantification of these N-glycans. Finally, we investigated the IgG N-glycan profiles of patients suffering from ovarian cancer using the conventional and methylation methods.With both methods, we observed an increase of agalactosylated structures that was accompanied by a decrease in digalactosylated structures. Finally, using the methylation protocol, we could further demonstrate an increase of A2, which was technically impossible with the conventional method.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812685","annotations":[{"name":"Oligosaccharide","weight":0.935706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligosaccharide"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Sialic acid","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sialic_acid"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.740716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.73601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.719037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Glycan","weight":0.57774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycan"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.557834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.49963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.397052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.341976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.20101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"3G","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G"},{"name":"4G","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G"},{"name":"2S1 Gvozdika","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2S1_Gvozdika"},{"name":"Capillary electrophoresis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Niacin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niacin"},{"name":"The Football Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association"},{"name":"Program optimization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization"},{"name":"G1 phase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1_phase"},{"name":"Second baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman"},{"name":"Sial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sial"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"2G","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2G"}]}
