{"id":18939,"title":"[The therapeutic efficacy of cycloferon and the pharmacological activity of interferon inducers].","abstract":"The review describes endogenous interferon inductors that belong to antiviral drugs and contain different chemical compounds. Among the groups identified by the authors, there are promising and most effective medicines inducing different types of interferon in the body, as well as their mechanism of action. The paper shows the synthesis of endogenous interferon and the level of its accumulation in the organs and tissues. The clinical effects of methylglucamine acridonacetate (cycloferon) are depicted in patients with major viral (influenza, acute respiratory viral and arboviral infections, and viral hepatitis) and bacterial (brucellosis, tuberculosis) infections, or endometrial hyperplastic processes. Cycloferon is shown to be used as an etiotropic and antipathogenic drug.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754075","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.802814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.751192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.721216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.541692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.521039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.517554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.423481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.350656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Brucellosis","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brucellosis"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Arbovirus","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbovirus"}]}
