{"id":20970,"title":"Treatment of onychomycosis using the 1 064 nm Nd:YAG laser: a clinical pilot study.","abstract":"Nd:YAG lasers could be a safe and effective treatment modality for onychomycosis, without the side effects of drugs. Long and short-pulsed Nd:YAG lasers were used in this clinical study in a side-comparison manner without removal of onychomycotic nail material before treatment.Big toenails of 10 patients were treated twice in a side-comparison manner with the short-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Fungal cultures were taken and a histological examination was performed before treatment and after 9 months. Two independent investigators rated clearance using the \"Onychomycosis Severity Index (OSI)\" and standardized photographs at 3-month intervals.OSI-Scores decreased for 3.8 (15 %; p = 0.006), 4.8 (19 %; p = 0.0002) and 2.9 points (12 %; p = 0.04) within 3, 6 and 9 months. The positive culture rate at 9 months was significantly reduced to 35 % (p = 0.0003). Classification of severity of onychomycosis showed no change. The difference between the treatment regimens was not significant.These results suggest that treatment of onychomycosis with the Nd:YAG laser without removing mycotic nail material can lead to a temporary clinical improvement, a reduction of positive fungal cultures and an improvement of the Onychomycosis Severity Index. The treatment regimen should be optimized to be used as an effective antimycotic monotherapy.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628827","annotations":[{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.736532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.67674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.635388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.616438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.484677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.336368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.285564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Onychomycosis","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onychomycosis"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.223014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Yttrium aluminium garnet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium_aluminium_garnet"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Neodymium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neodymium"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
