{"id":38206,"title":"Major histocompatibility complex and inflammatory cell subtype expression in inflammatory myopathies and muscular dystrophies.","abstract":"In inflammatory myopathies muscle biopsy is a crucial diagnostic test. Misinterpretation between inflammatory myopathies and muscular dystrophies with inflammation is known.Thirty-one patients clinically and pathologically diagnosed to have polymyositis and dermatomyositis and 16 patients of muscular dystrophy with inflammation were studied for MHC-I, MHC-II, CD4 and CD8 expression in skeletal muscle tissue.MHC-I upregulation was noted in all samples of PM and DM. Interstitial and perivascular inflammation in PM were predominantly CD8+ cells, in dermatomyositis, interstitial and perimysial perivascular inflammatory cells were CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were seen around endomysial vessels. Interestingly MHC-I upregulation was seen in all 16 cases of muscular dystrophy with presence of inflammation.The pattern of MHC-I and II expression appeared to be similar in both inflammatory myopathies as well as in muscular dystrophies with inflammation and hence differentiating them on MHC - I expression was difficult.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24441329","annotations":[{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Dermatomyositis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatomyositis"},{"name":"Polymyositis","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymyositis"},{"name":"Muscular dystrophy","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.806801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Myopathy","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopathy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.728404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Muscle biopsy","weight":0.725586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_biopsy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.714297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.405052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.189465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Inflammatory myopathy","weight":0.148784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_myopathy"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Histocompatibility","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histocompatibility"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"}]}
