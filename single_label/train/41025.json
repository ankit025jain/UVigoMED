{"id":41025,"title":"[Biological treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases in children in the years 2004-2013 in Poland].","abstract":"In the last years an increase in Crohn's disease morbidity in children is observed together with constant morbidity of ulcerative colitis. The course of these diseases is severe, younger children are affected and the diseases are resistant to conventional treatment. Biological drugs are a chance for a longer remission and healing of the intestinal mucosa. OBJECTIVE OF THE WORK: Assessment of the use of biological drugs in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in Poland was the objective of the work.Gastroenterological centers treating inflammatory bowel disease during the years 2004-2013 were invited to a questionnaire retrospective study.The questionnaires of biological treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in children were received from 12 centers. In the years 2004-2013 the number of children aged 4 months to 18 years with Crohn's disease treated with biological drugs was 424. In the years 2004-2008--69 children were treated with infliximab and in the years 2009-2013--299 children, which was a four-fold increase. 56 children were treated with adalimumab in the years 2008-2013. In the years 2005-2013--72 children with ulcerative colitis were treated with infliximab and 11 with adalimumab. The age of the children ranged from 2 years to 18 years. The higher number of children treated was in the years 2009-2013: 59 with infliximab and 10 with adalimumab.In the last decade a significant increase on the number of children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis treated with biological drugs was observed. It is connected not only to greater morbidity but above all to the introduction of a treatment program by the National Health Insurance Fund for children with Crohn's disease. There is an expectation that the introduction of biological treatment in inflammatory bowel disease will prolong clinical and endoscopic remission and diminish the number of surgeries.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964507","annotations":[{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Infliximab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infliximab"},{"name":"Adalimumab","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalimumab"},{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.685154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.662605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.659278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.604058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.603266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.488177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.361225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.359427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.333498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Universal health care","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care"}]}
