{"id":14934,"title":"Design, synthesis and evaluation of 9-hydroxy-7H-furo[3,2-g]chromen-7-one derivatives as new potential vasodilatory agents.","abstract":"Two new 9-hydroxy-7H-furo[3,2-g]chromen-7-one derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro vasodilatory activity. The structures of two compounds were elucidated by infrared, Â¹H NMR, and mass spectral data. The in vitro pharmacological evaluation indicated that both of them possessed well vasodilatory activity compared with imperatorin. The molecule docking also showed two target compounds docked well with L-calcium channel (PDB code: 3G43). The result suggested that they would be potential vasodilatory agents for hypertension.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397331","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Hydroxyl","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Nuclear magnetic resonance","weight":0.575943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.561425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.421586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Protein Data Bank","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.256279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.160085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.117206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"3G","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Demonic possession","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonic_possession"},{"name":"Docking (molecular)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Gewehr 43","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gewehr_43"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"}]}
