{"id":77607,"title":"[Preservation of ability to work and securing vocational participation : non-pharmaceutical support options for rheumatologists].","abstract":"For patients of working age with chronic rheumatic diseases preservation of the ability to work and therefore for equal participation in professional life is of particular importance. Significant supporting actions by rheumatologists include non-pharmaceutical and non-medical interventions in addition to drug therapy. Measures aiming at sustained working capacity such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, medical rehabilitation and stepwise return to work have to be utilized. This support can include referral to a counseling service and assistance with the application for medical or vocational rehabilitation programs. In order to ensure sustainable success of the initiated measures it is essential that follow-up care and function-related interventions are supervised by a rheumatologist.
