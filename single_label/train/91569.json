{"id":91569,"title":"Patterns of burns and scalds in children.","abstract":"To describe the characteristics of childhood burns and scalds, mechanisms and agents to inform prevention.Prospective multicentred cross-sectional study of children (<16 years) with unintentional burns/scalds from five Emergency Departments (ED), a burns assessment unit and three regional children's Burns Units.site, severity, distribution of the burn/scald, age, motor development of the child, agent and mechanism of the injury. Comparative analysis for children <5 and 5-16 years.Of 1215 children, 58% (709) had scalds, 32% (390) contact burns and 116 burns from other causes, 17.6% (214/1215) were admitted to hospital and the remaining treated in ED or burns assessment centre. 72% (878) were <5 years, peak prevalence in 1-year-olds. Commonest scald agent (<5 years) was a cup/mug of hot beverage 55% (305/554), and commonest mechanism was a pull-down injury 48% (66/554). In 5-16-year-olds, scalds were from hot water 50% (78/155) and spill injuries 76% (118/155). Scalds affected the front of the body in 96% (680/709): predominantly to the face, arms and upper trunk in <5-year-olds, older children had scalds to the lower trunk, legs and hands. Contact burns (<5 years) were from touching 81% (224/277) hot items in the home, predominant agents: hair straighteners or irons 42% (117/277), oven hobs 27% (76/277), 5-16-year-olds sustained more outdoor injuries 46% (52/113). 67% (262/390) of all contact burns affected the hands.Scalds to infants and toddlers who pull hot beverages over themselves or sustain burns from touching irons, hair straighteners or oven hobs are a high priority for targeted prevention.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492796","annotations":[{"name":"Infant","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.442833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.425721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.286132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.212277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.206729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Toddler","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Engine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine"},{"name":"Coat of arms","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1215","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1215"},{"name":"878","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/878"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Telecine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecine"},{"name":"Oven","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oven"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Hob (folklore)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hob_(folklore)"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Distribution (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(business)"},{"name":"Law of agency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency"},{"name":"Hair iron","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_iron"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"}]}
