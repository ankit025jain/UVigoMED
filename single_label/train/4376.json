{"id":4376,"title":"Identification of soluble and membrane antigenic markers of acquired toxoplasmosis by immunoblot.","abstract":"The overall performance of quantitative assays in the detection of anti-Toxoplasma IgG is satisfactory, but discrepancies between assays are not uncommon especially when IgG concentrations are close to the limit of detection of the tests. The purpose of our study was to identify soluble and membrane antigens extracted from Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites by immunoblot to select the most relevant antigenic bands to be used for qualitative serodiagnosis of acquired toxoplasmosis. We selected five relevant bands (98, 36, 33, 32 and 21 kDa) with soluble antigens and four relevant bands (42, 35, 32 and 30 kDa) with membrane antigens which gave high sensitivity and/or specificity in immunodiagnosis. The association on the same blot of at least three of the five relevant bands in the soluble antigen immunoblot showed the highest sensitivity/specificity (97.4%/99.0%, respectively). Our results indicate that immunoblot using soluble tachyzoite extract with simultaneous detection of at least three of the five bands (98, 36, 33, 32 and 21 kDa) represents a valuable test for serodiagnosis of acquired toxoplasmosis and should be further evaluated as a confirmatory test for sera which give discrepant results in quantitative assays.","date":"2014-11-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25384440","annotations":[{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.795287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Toxoplasma gondii","weight":0.716628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Apicomplexa lifecycle stages","weight":0.556426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Toxoplasmosis","weight":0.454069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.147191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Pentachromacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentachromacy"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
