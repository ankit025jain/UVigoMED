{"id":86525,"title":"Subtype-specific KRAS mutations in advanced lung adenocarcinoma: a retrospective study of patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.","abstract":"Platinum-based chemotherapy is the most common treatment in advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma. Because the clinical significance of KRAS mutational status in this setting has not yet been clearly determined, a mutation subtype-specific analysis was performed in the so far largest cohort of Caucasian patients with KRAS mutant advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.505 Caucasian stage III-IV lung adenocarcinoma patients with known amino acid substitution-specific KRAS mutational status and treated with platinum-based chemotherapy were included. The correlations of subtype-specific KRAS mutations with smoking status, progression-free and overall survival (PFS and OS, respectively) and therapeutic response were analysed.Among 338 KRAS wild-type, 147 codon 12 mutant and 20 codon 13 mutant patients, there were no mutation-related significant differences in PFS or OS (P values were 0.534 and 0.917, respectively). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status and clinical stage were significant independent prognostic factors. KRAS mutation showed a significant correlation with smoking status (P=0.018). Importantly, however, G12V KRAS mutant patients were significantly more frequent among never-smokers than all other codon 12 KRAS mutant (G12x) subtypes (P=0.016). Furthermore, this subgroup tended to have a higher response rate (66% versus 47%; P=0.077). A modestly longer median PFS was also found in the G12V mutant cohort (233days; versus 175days in the G12x group; P=0.145).While KRAS mutation status per se is neither prognostic nor predictive in stage III-IV lung adenocarcinoma, subtype-specific analysis may indeed identify clinically relevant subgroups of patients that may ultimately influence treatment decisions.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768329","annotations":[{"name":"Amino
