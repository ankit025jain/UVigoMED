{"id":28419,"title":"Cannabis use and first manic episode.","abstract":"Cannabis is the most commonly abused drug among patients with bipolar disorder. Available data has shown that the risk of psychotic disorders increases with the frequency and intensity of cannabis abuse. The present purpose was to review relevant studies to investigate whether cannabis use can be linked to the onset of mania in bipolar disorder.Articles published between 1972 and December 2013 were searched on Medline and PsychInfo using the following keywords: first manic episode, or onset mania, or bipolar disorder and cannabis. Relevant papers cited in the references of selected articles were further considered for inclusion into the review.Lifetime use of cannabis among bipolar patients appears to be around 70% and approximately 30% of patients with a bipolar disorder present a comorbidity of cannabis abuse or dependence. Cannabis use is associated with younger age at onset of first mania and with more frequent depressive or manic episodes, although the evidence is somewhat inconsistent. Likewise cannabis consumption is related to poorer outcome and an increased risk of rapid cycling or mixed episodes. In contrast, neuro-cognitive functioning seems to be positively affected in patients with psychiatric comorbidity. While cannabis use often precedes first manic episodes, the causal direction remains to be determined.Variations in definition of cannabis use/dependence. Lack of controlled studies limiting definite conclusions about a putative causal relationship between cannabis and onset of mania.Further investigations are needed to clarify the relationships between cannabis use and first manic episode.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24882185","annotations":[{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.861801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Manic episode","weight":0.797205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_episode"},{"name":"Mixed state (psychiatry)","weight":0.796422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_state_(psychiatry)"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Neurocognitive","weight":0.722756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurocognitive"},{"name":"Psychosis","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis"},{"name":"Mania","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.590093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.551285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.4491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.353812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.329115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.253709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.202479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Rapid cycling","weight":0.0793948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_cycling"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cycling","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Legality of cannabis","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis"},{"name":"Lifetime (TV network)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifetime_(TV_network)"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
