{"id":90183,"title":"Extensor tendon dislocation after end-to-side transfer in a rheumatoid patient.","abstract":"We report a case of extensor tendon dislocation at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the middle finger in which it appeared that an ulnar translation force created by an end-to-side transfer contributed to the dislocation. We recommend alterations in technique or alternative method of extensor tendon reconstruction to avoid this complication if unfavorable factors for end-to-side transfer exist.
