{"id":11700,"title":"Additive effect of combined application of magnesium and MK-801 on analgesic action of morphine.","abstract":"As previously reported, magnesium ions (Mg(2+)) administered in relatively low doses markedly potentiated opioid analgesia in neuropathic pain, in which the effectiveness of opioids is limited. Considering that Mg(2+) behaves like an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, the effect of this ion on the analgesic action of morphine was compared with that of MK-801. Acute pain was evoked by mechanical or thermal stimuli, whereas neuropathic hyperalgesia was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) administration. Magnesium sulphate (40 mg/kg i.p.) or MK-801 (0.05 mg/kg s.c.) administered alone did not modify the nociceptive threshold to acute stimuli or the streptozotocin hyperalgesia but significantly augmented the analgesic action of morphine (5 mg/kg i.p.). Furthermore, if these drugs (i.e. magnesium sulphate and MK-801) were applied concomitantly, a clear additive effect on the analgesic action of morphine occurred in both models of pain. Possible explanations of these observations are discussed.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24577345","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Hyperalgesia","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia"},{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Neuropathic pain","weight":0.844261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathic_pain"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.818871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Magnesium sulfate","weight":0.751311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_sulfate"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.745354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.650959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.646472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0867165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Thermal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal"},{"name":"Threshold potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_potential"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Behavioral addiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_addiction"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
