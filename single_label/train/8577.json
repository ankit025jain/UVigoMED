{"id":8577,"title":"The adapter protein c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP) protects from acute CVB3-mediated myocarditis through stabilization of type I interferon production and reduced cytotoxicity.","abstract":"c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP), also called Sorbs1 or ponsin, has been described as an essential adapter protein in the insulin-signalling pathway. Here, we describe for the first time a unique protective role for CAP in viral myocarditis. Mortality and heart failure development were increased in CAP(-/-) mice compared to CAP(+/+) littermates after Coxsackievirus (CVB3) infection. Mechanistically, CAP protected from tissue apoptosis because of reduced CD8(+) T and natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Despite reduced cytotoxic elimination of CVB3-infected cells in CAP(+/+) hearts, however, CAP enhanced interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent antiviral type I interferon production and decreased viral proliferation in vitro by binding to the cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptor melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). Taken together, these findings reveal a novel modulatory role for CAP in the heart as a key protein stabilizing antiviral type I interferon production, while protecting from excessive cytotoxic responses. Our study will help to define future strategies to develop treatments to limit detrimental responses during viral heart inflammation.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763933","annotations":[{"name":"Coxsackievirus","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxsackievirus"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Myocarditis","weight":0.818956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocarditis"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.791784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.751192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Signal transducing adaptor protein","weight":0.694678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transducing_adaptor_protein"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.679314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"IRF3","weight":0.441686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRF3"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.329805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"IFIH1","weight":0.241132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFIH1"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.199121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Interferon type I","weight":0.186848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_I"},{"name":"Neuromodulation","weight":0.0668479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Interferon regulatory factors","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_regulatory_factors"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
