{"id":87543,"title":"Reconstruction of neglected patellar tendon ruptures using the quadriceps graft.","abstract":"Several techniques using different grafts have been described for reconstruction of the patellar tendon after a neglected rupture. Retraction of the quadriceps tendon may compromise repair integrity due to progressive stretching of the graft. The authors present a surgical technique using the central one-third of the quadriceps tendon. This is supported by the fact that the resistance to traction of this segment of the quadriceps tendon equals that of a double-looped semitendinosus graft and that the harvesting of this specific graft promotes muscle inhibition, thus protecting the reconstruction during the recovery period.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102494","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.516083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Quadriceps femoris muscle","weight":0.314357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriceps_femoris_muscle"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.280357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Patellar ligament","weight":0.247918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellar_ligament"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.144454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Semitendinosus muscle","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitendinosus_muscle"},{"name":"Tendinosis","weight":0.108778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinosis"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Quadriceps tendon","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriceps_tendon"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Sprain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprain"},{"name":"Retraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retraction"},{"name":"Harvest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest"},{"name":"Stretching","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretching"},{"name":"Drag (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"}]}
