{"id":57100,"title":"Management of preeclampsia when diagnosed between 34-37 weeks gestation: deliver now or deliberate until 37 weeks?","abstract":"To evaluate maternal-newborn outcomes with immediate or expectantly managed preeclampsia first diagnosed at 34-37 weeks.Late preterm patients with preeclampsia without severe features were randomly assigned to immediate delivery (n=94) or expectant management (n = 75) until 37 weeks gestation or earlier if severe features developed. Data were analyzed by appropriate tests for continuous or categorical outcomes with differences considered significant if p < 0.05.The two groups were similar at presentation. 41% of those expectantly managed developed severe features of preeclampsia within 72 hours versus 3% in the immediately delivered group (p < 0.001). Immediate delivery did not significantly increase cesarean delivery or neonatal morbidity.Immediate delivery of the late preterm patient with preeclampsia significantly lessens her development of severe features without significantly increasing newborn risks. For the expectantly managed late preterm patient with preeclampsia, close surveillance for the first 72 hours following diagnosis and twice weekly thereafter appears prudent.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252423","annotations":[{"name":"Infant","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.370553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.294193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.229836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.166395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.0682051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.0310064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Immediate Records","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_Records"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Presentation (obstetrics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_(obstetrics)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Spot date","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_date"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
