{"id":82911,"title":"Treatment of craniofacial fibrous dysplasia: a case report.","abstract":"The concept of \"fibro-osseous lesions\" of bone has evolved over the last several years and now includes two mayor entities: the fibrous dysplasia (FD) and the cement-ossifying fibroma (COF). Fibrous dysplasia is considered to be a developmental, tumor-like (hamartomatous), fibro-osseous disease of unknown etiology. There is a maxillary predominance when craniofacial FD occurs in the jaws and the maxillary sinus is commonly involved. Differentiation of OF from FD is important because of differences in treatment and behaviour. This article report a case of 60-year-old female with a history of painless unilateral palatal swelling.
