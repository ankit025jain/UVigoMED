{"id":30941,"title":"[Modern elucidative strategies for scientific connotation of controlling toxic reactions while toxic herbs are used to the indication syndrome].","abstract":"One of effective measures for controlling toxic reactions is to use toxic herbs according to corresponding indication syndrome. It is important to develop toxicity theory of Chinese medicine in a sound and international way using modern language to elucidate its scientific connotation. We expect to explain scientific connotation of controlling toxic reaction while toxic herbs are used to the indication syndrome by using holistic research ideas and methods capable of reflecting governing exterior to infer interior, establish appropriate corresponding syndrome animal models by cutting into dose-effect/toxicity of toxic Chinese herbs, construct and analyze multi-layer molecular network using theories and technologies of metabonomics, network biology, and bioinformatics.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432691","annotations":[{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Holism","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.487609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.461374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.395489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.339153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"China","weight":0.257943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"International","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0768603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Chinese herbology","weight":0.0633088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_herbology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Modern language","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_language"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Connotation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connotation"},{"name":"Self-harm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm"}]}
