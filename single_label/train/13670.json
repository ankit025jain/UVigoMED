{"id":13670,"title":"[Recovery from parkinsonism with N-acetylcysteine-differentiated neurons].","abstract":"The upregulation of dopaminergic neuronal differentiation is necessary for stem cell therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, neuronal differentiation efficiency increased by more than 2 times in P19 embryonic stem cells (ESCs) induced by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and retinoic acid (RA) as compared to RA alone, with suppressed glial differentiation. The majority of NAC-treated stem cells grafted into brains of PD mice differentiated into dopaminergic neurons and persisted well for 6 weeks. Parkinsonism was also greatly improved after grafting NAC-treated cells in comparison to cells treated with only RA. Our results strongly suggest that NAC treatment may be an effective strategy for generating stem cells fated to become dopaminergic neurons for PD clinical therapy.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466751","annotations":[{"name":"Retinoic acid","weight":0.854513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoic_acid"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.848098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.809484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Stem cell treatments","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_treatments"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Embryonic stem cell","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Neuroglia","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroglia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.69026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Parkinsonism","weight":0.51283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonism"},{"name":"Cell therapy","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"},{"name":"Grafting","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting"}]}
