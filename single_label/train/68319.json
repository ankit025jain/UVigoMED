{"id":68319,"title":"Fully automated volumetric modulated arc therapy plan generation for prostate cancer patients.","abstract":"To develop and evaluate fully automated volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatment planning for prostate cancer patients, avoiding manual trial-and-error tweaking of plan parameters by dosimetrists.A system was developed for fully automated generation of VMAT plans with our commercial clinical treatment planning system (TPS), linked to the in-house developed Erasmus-iCycle multicriterial optimizer for preoptimization. For 30 randomly selected patients, automatically generated VMAT plans (VMATauto) were compared with VMAT plans generated manually by 1 expert dosimetrist in the absence of time pressure (VMATman). For all treatment plans, planning target volume (PTV) coverage and sparing of organs-at-risk were quantified.All generated plans were clinically acceptable and had similar PTV coverage (V95% > 99%). For VMATauto and VMATman plans, the organ-at-risk sparing was similar as well, although only the former plans were generated without any planning workload.Fully automated generation of high-quality VMAT plans for prostate cancer patients is feasible and has recently been implemented in our clinic.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529714","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.543019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.23109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.129335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.101002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"TPS (ice hockey)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPS_(ice_hockey)"},{"name":"Pakistan Television Corporation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Television_Corporation"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Compiler optimization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler_optimization"},{"name":"Glossary of chess","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Planning permission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_permission"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Tweaking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweaking"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Vesicular monoamine transporter","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicular_monoamine_transporter"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Electric arc","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc"},{"name":"Workload","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workload"}]}
