{"id":17952,"title":"SCCmec types and pvl gene in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains from children hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital in Mexico.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, SCCmec types, presence of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene, and susceptibility to antibiotics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains isolated from hospitalized children.From August 2009 to September 2011, 291 S. aureus strains were isolated from normally sterile body sites, of which 190 (65%) were MRSA. One hundred and two of the MRSA strains were genetically evaluated. SCCmec genotypes were identified by M-PCR and the PVL gene (pvl) by end-point PCR. Resistance to erythromycin, rifampicin, clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) was assessed by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines of 2012.Of the 102 strains evaluated, 97 (95%) were SCCmec type II, 5 (5%) were SCCmec type IVa, and all (100%) were pvl-negative. Resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, rifampicin, and SXT was 97%, 95%, 0%, and 0%, respectively.The prevalence of hospital-acquired MRSA was high. SCCmec type II was predominant and the pvl gene appeared not to play any role in the virulence of the MRSA strains from hospitalized children.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24832853","annotations":[{"name":"Erythromycin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythromycin"},{"name":"Rifampicin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.855723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.825421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.672261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.667881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.445686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.434199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.37397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Clindamycin","weight":0.357341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clindamycin"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.321605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.20368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole","weight":0.158473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole"},{"name":"Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_and_Laboratory_Standards_Institute"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"291","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/291"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Panton-Valentine leukocidin","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panton-Valentine_leukocidin"},{"name":"Leukocidin","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocidin"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
