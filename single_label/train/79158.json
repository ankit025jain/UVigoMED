{"id":79158,"title":"[Clinical analysis on 18 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma of nasal cavity and sinuses].","abstract":"To explore the clinical characteristics and treatment effect of adenoid cystic carcinoma in nasal cavity and sinuses.Sixteen of all 18 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma of nasal cavity and sinuses were performed operation and radiotherapy. Other 2 cases were performed radiotherapy.Eighteen cases of patients were followed up for 5 years. Eight patients with early stage had no death. Five in 10 cases of advanced patients died, one case was out of following-up. In 11 of high differentiation group, 1 case died. In 7 of lower differentiation group, 4 cases died, 1 case lost.Adenoid cystic carcinomas of nasal cavity and sinuses are distinct clinicopathological category and the clinical symptoms are noncharacteristic. Paying attention to the differential diagnosis and promoting related knowledge can help to avoid misdiagnosis. The prognosis is related to pathological category and clinical stage. High stage and high invasion of adenoid cystic carcinoma lead to poor prognosis.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479360","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma","weight":0.738136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoid_cystic_carcinoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.731492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Nasal cavity","weight":0.62447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.62417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.593477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.38991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Pharyngeal tonsil","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_tonsil"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0961829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Nostril","weight":0.0293966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostril"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"}]}
