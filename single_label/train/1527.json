{"id":1527,"title":"[Secondary data analysis of the prevalence of alcohol dependence (F10.2) in Germany].","abstract":"Compared to other European countries, alcohol consumption and abuse in Germany is on a high level. Even in smaller quantities, frequent alcohol consumption can generate organic damages and thus lead to secondary diseases that have a significant societal relevance regarding direct and indirect costs for the healthcare system. After several publications have already addressed the prevalence of acute alcohol intoxication and alcohol abuse in adolescents, the question arises how the prevalence of alcohol abuse develops on the basis of the accounting data of outpatient and inpatient care providers in the population of adults aged 18 and over and what tendency can be observed within a multi-year period. Within this study, the coding of alcohol abuse (F10.2 diagnosis) was analyzed separately for outpatient and inpatient sector in the insured population ? 18 years and presented over time.The development of the prevalence of alcohol abuse was analyzed on the basis of secondary random sample data from one nation-wide working statutory health insurance with a total population of more than 3 million insurants in the 5-year period from 2006 to 2010. For the presentation of the prevalences, insurant numbers were used. For the identification of the relevant insurants, only confirmed outpatient F10.2 diagnoses or inpatient F10.2 diagnoses were used. The age and sex distributions of the dataset were adjusted to the distribution in the statutory health insurance to ensure representativeness. The analyses of each single year only allude to insured persons aged ? 18 years. With the help of the statistics of the insured of statutory health insurance, for each calendar year, projections of the detected prevalence rates were determined to estimate the number of cases on the statutory health insurance level and their development over time.The results show a tendency of slightly increasing prevalence of alcohol dependence from 2006 to 2010. For insured persons with at least one inpatient or outpatient F10.2 diagnosis, the prevalence continuously rises from 1,04% in 2006 to 1.14% in 2010; the prevalence of insured persons who received an alcohol dependence diagnosis only in the outpatient sector, increased from 0,67% to 0,79% in that time scale. In all analyzes, there was a ratio of 30% affected women to 70% affected men. From 2006 to 2010, the proportion of insured persons with hospitalization caused by alcohol dependence decreased steadily from 14,51% to 12,24%.For the analyzed group of persons aged ? 18 years, the present analysis results show a tendency of slightly increasing prevalences of alcohol abuse, however at the same time combined with a decreasing proportion of hospitalized patients. Similar nationwide studies from 2010 on the basis of secondary data of a health insurance company and inclusion of outpatient and inpatient diagnoses also indicate prevalences of alcohol dependence of about 1.18%, but they base on the age range of 15- to 64-year-old insurants.","date":"2014-10-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced
