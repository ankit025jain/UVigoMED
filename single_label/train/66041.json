{"id":66041,"title":"Knowing what we do and doing what we should: quality assurance in hemodialysis.","abstract":"An international group of around 50 nephrologists and scientists, including representatives from large dialysis provider organisations, formulated recommendations on how to develop and implement quality assurance measures to improve individual hemodialysis patient care, population health and cost effectiveness. Discussed were methods thought to be of highest priority, those clinical indicators which might be most related to meaningful patient outcomes, tools to control treatment delivery and the role of facilitating computerized expert systems. Emphasis was given to the use of new technologies such as measurement of online dialysance and ways of assessing fluid status. The current evidence linking achievement of quality criteria with patient outcomes was reviewed. This paper summarizes useful processes and quality measures supporting quality assurance that have been agreed across the expert panel. It also notes areas where more understanding is required.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751758","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.577731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Scientist","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.283281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.262303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.208106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.196096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.189774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Expert system","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Cost-effectiveness analysis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-effectiveness_analysis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Population health","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_health"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Knowing (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowing_(film)"},{"name":"Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report_of_the_Secretary-General's_Panel_of_Experts_on_Accountability_in_Sri_Lanka"},{"name":"Committee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Business process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process"},{"name":"Emphasis/Who Wants to Live Forever","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphasis/Who_Wants_to_Live_Forever"}]}
