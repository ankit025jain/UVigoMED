{"id":62533,"title":"Predictive factors for the outcome of allogeneic transplantation in patients with MDS stratified according to the revised IPSS-R.","abstract":"Approximately one-third of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are cured by this treatment. Treatment failure may be due to transplant complications or relapse. To identify predictive factors for transplantation outcome, we studied 519 patients with MDS or oligoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (AML, <30% marrow blasts) who received an allogeneic HSCT and were reported to the Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo registry between 2000 and 2011. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. High-risk category, as defined by the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), and monosomal karyotype were independently associated with relapse and lower overall survival after transplantation. On the other hand, older recipient age and high hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index (HCT-CI) were independent predictors of nonrelapse mortality. Accounting for various combinations of patient's age, IPSS-R category, monosomal karyotype, and HCT-CI, the 5-year probability of survival after allogeneic HSCT ranged from 0% to 94%. This study indicates that IPSS-R risk category and monosomal karyotype are important factors predicting transplantation failure both in MDS and oligoblastic AML. In addition, it reinforces the concept that allogeneic HSCT offers optimal eradication of myelodysplastic hematopoiesis when the procedure is performed before MDS patients progress to advanced disease stages.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558201","annotations":[{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.794893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.679314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.59545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.561534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.52159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.310685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Predictive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_medicine"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
