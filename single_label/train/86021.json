The objective of this study was to determine the clinical significance of the serum levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. One hundred and thirty lung cancer patients were enrolled into this study. Serum VCAM-1 levels were determined by the solid-phase sandwich ELISA method. Age- and sex-matched 34 healthy controls were included in the analysis. Median age was 58 years old, range 35 to 80 years. The majority of the patients had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (83.8 %) and stage IV disease (60.8 %). The patients' baseline serum VCAM-1 levels were significantly higher than those in the healthy control group (p?=?0.02). Male patients had higher serum VCAM-1 level compared with female patients (p?=?0.04). The stage of disease and tumor histology were not correlated with serum VCAM-1 assay (p?>?0.05). Elevated serum VCAM-1 levels were associated with chemotherapy unresponsive patients compared with responsive patients (p?=?0.02). The patients with elevated serum VCAM-1 levels had lower survival rates than the ones with lower levels (1-year survival rate 57.6 vs 69.7 %, respectively, p?=?0.04). In conclusion, serum VCAM-1 concentrations may have diagnostic, predictive, and prognostic role in lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824873","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.868312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.812631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.640476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.631923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.617121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.597689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.498857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.467113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.461763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.387536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.327143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.269237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Vascular tissue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_tissue"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
