{"id":10551,"title":"HMG-CoA reductase is negatively associated with PCV2 infection and PCV2-induced apoptotic cell death.","abstract":"We examined the role of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) during porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) infection. The results demonstrated that levels of endogenous HMGCR were not significantly different in PCV2-infected cells and mock-infected cells. However, the level of phosphorylated HMGCR, an inactivated form of HMGCR, was increased in PCV2-infected cells. Furthermore, HMGCR was upregulated by overexpression, silenced by siRNA or inactivated using its dominant-negative form in PK-15 cells. The results showed that PCV2 infection was inhibited by HMGCR overexpression, whereas it was significantly increased in HMGCR-silenced cells and HMGCR inhibitor-treated cells. Moreover, there was a robust apoptotic response at 48 h post-infection (p.i.) in HMGCR-inactivated cells, and this response was significantly greater than that observed in PK-15 cells. A modest apoptotic response was also observed in HMGCR-silenced cells. Caspase-3 activity was also analysed in PCV2-infected cells at 48 h p.i. As expected, caspase-3 activity was significantly increased in HMGCR-inactivated and -silenced cells compared with PK-15 cells. PCV2 replication was dose-dependently increased in HMGCR-inactivated cells when treated with increasing amounts of caspase-3 inhibitor. Altogether, HMGCR was negatively associated with PCV2 infection and PCV2-induced apoptotic cell death. These data demonstrated that HMGCR can be used as a candidate target for PCV2 disease control and antivirus research. Furthermore, the cells generated in this study can be used to evaluate the potential effects of HMGCR on PCV2 replication.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24643880","annotations":[{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.903743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.711179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"HMG-CoA reductase","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMG-CoA_reductase"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.340374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Antivirus software","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software"},{"name":"Porcine circovirus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcine_circovirus"},{"name":"Suidae","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suidae"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
