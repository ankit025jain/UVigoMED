{"id":22699,"title":"Postoperative spondylodiscitis. A review of 24 consecutive patients.","abstract":"Postoperative discitis is a rare complication of spine surgery that creates a significant patient suffering and requires long-term treatment. The aim of this study was to compare the empirical antibiotic treatment with the treatment according antibiotics to susceptibility of isolates germs in curing this complication.In the period January 2002 - December 2012, 4698 patients were operated for lumbar spine disorders:lumbar disc herniation, spinal canal stenosis. Of these patients, 47 (1%) were diagnosed with postoperative discitis. In December 2012 there were 24 cases of spondylodiscitis after lumbar disc herniation operated by inter-lamar approach and foraminotomy. The A group of 13 patients received antistaphylococcalempirical antibiotic treatment. The B group consisting of 11 patients received antibiotic therapy after germ isolation by open biopsy from discal intervertebral space (n=8)and from surgical wound secretion (n=3) and antibiotic susceptibility testing.After 4 to 6 months of antibiotic treatment associated with immobilization in Boston corset the symptoms gradually improved in parallel with normalization of biological constants, ESR, CRP. Five patients of Group A did not respond to the given antibiotic treatment and required further debridement and germ isolation.Spondylodiscitis is a complication of spine surgery that is treated with antibiotics given for a long time of 4-6 months. Germ isolation by needle biopsy or open biopsy allows proper antibiotic treatment and faster healing.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524476","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.6415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.529262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.501005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.456126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.414275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.377171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.375755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Spinal canal","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_canal"},{"name":"Spinal disc herniation","weight":0.213585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.171955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Boston","weight":0.167032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Corset","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corset"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Discitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discitis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"}]}
