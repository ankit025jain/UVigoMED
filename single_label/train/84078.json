{"id":84078,"title":"Liminality as a conceptual frame for understanding the family caregiving rite of passage: an integrative review.","abstract":"Family caregiving is a significant rite of passage experienced by family caregivers of individuals with protracted illness or injury. In an integrative review of 26 studies, we characterized family caregiving from the sociocultural perspective of liminality and explored associated psychosocial implications. Analysis of published evidence on this dynamic and formative transition produced a range of themes. While role ambiguity resolved for most, for others, uncertainty and suffering continued. The process of becoming a caregiver was transformative and can be viewed as a rebirth that is largely socially and culturally driven. The transition to family caregiving model produced by this review provides a holistic perspective on this phenomenon and draws attention to aspects of the experience previously underappreciated.
