{"id":60108,"title":"[Analysis of 736 blood transfusions in a geriatric teaching hospital].","abstract":"Red blood cell transfusion in elderly patients with anemia requires taking into account a hemoglobin threshold, as well as comorbidities that may be decompensated by anemia. In the absence of consensual indications for blood transfusion in the elderly population, it seems important to evaluate the practical approach of blood transfusion in geriatrics. We analyzed prescriptions of red blood cell transfusion in very old patients hospitalized in a geriatric teaching hospital.This retrospective study was based on information collected during one year in 736 red blood cell transfusion prescriptions. Hemoglobin levels, numbers of red blood cell units and clinical informations notified by prescribing physicians have been collected and analyzed.The mean hemoglobin level before red blood cell transfusion was 8.45±0.94g/dL. Two variables were significantly associated with an increase of the transfusion threshold above 9g/dL: the poor tolerance of anemia (P<10(-4)) and clinical situations at risk for poor tolerance of anemia (P=0.0076). The most frequent symptoms of poor tolerance of anemia were cardiovascular symptoms and also acute neuropsychiatric symptoms that could be considered as specific criteria for the red cell transfusion in the elderly. The mean number of red blood cell units prescribed for each transfusion was 1.88±0.55 and the only predictive factor was the hemoglobin level (P<0.001).In our geriatric practice, transfusion thresholds and target hemoglobin levels after transfusion seemed to be comparable with the thresholds recommended in the only available French guidelines edited in 2002 by the Afssaps. However, our study pointed out specific geriatric particularities in red blood cell transfusion prescriptions with the use of some tolerance criteria that seem related to non-cardiovascular comorbidities. Future prospective interventional studies could be conducted in order to evaluate the clinical relevance of these potential specific geriatric criteria in transfusion indications.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24997876","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.863551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.814652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.636415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.620719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neuropsychiatry","weight":0.476225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.398354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.288198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.281557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.267374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.244882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"France","weight":0.122601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0907784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0408123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Communism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.0140385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"}]}
