{"id":64101,"title":"Probiotics' preventive effect on pediatric food allergy: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.","abstract":"To investigate the preventive effect of probiotics on pediatric food allergy.From MEDLINE bibliographical database, we searched and reviewed all randomized controlled trials on the preventive effects of probiotics on pediatric food allergies up to September 2013 and excluded the studies that do not meet inclusion criteria and extracted the data. Meta-analysis for the results of homogenous studies was performed using RevMan 5.0 and the co-effect was pooled by using fixed-effects model of relative risk (RR) ratios.Ten trials published between 2007 and 2012 including 2701 cases were included. Meta-analysis based on included data showed that the preventive effect of prenatal and postnatal probiotic supplementation on food allergies was not significant with the RR=0.88 (95% CI: 0.76-1.03).Present evidences cannot show in unequivocal terms that prenatal and postnatal probiotic supplementation will prevent food allergic diseases.","date":"2014-09-30","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25264881","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.68333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.497303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.437926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.421978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.275302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Food allergy","weight":0.147222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_allergy"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"761","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/761"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Bibliography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliography"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
