{"id":88698,"title":"[Primary treatment of penetrating injuries. Part 1: blast trauma].","abstract":"Blast injuries may result from a variety of causes but the biomechanical impact and pathophysiological consequences do not differ between domestic or industrial accidents or even terrorist attacks. However, this differentiation relevantly affects the tactical procedures of the rescue teams. Focusing on further detonations, top priority is given to the personal safety of all rescue workers. The rareness of blast injuries in a civilian setting results in a lack of experience on the one hand but on the other hand the complexity of blast injuries to the human body places high demands on the knowledge and skills of the entire rescue team for competent treatment. The purpose of this article is to explain the physicochemical principles of explosions and to convey tactical and medical knowledge to emergency medical services.
