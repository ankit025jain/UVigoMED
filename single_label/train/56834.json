{"id":56834,"title":"Sequential episodes of perioperative ischemic optic neuropathy after hip surgery.","abstract":"Perioperative ischemic optic neuropathy (ION) after nonocular surgery is a rare complication leading to permanent and often severe vision loss. Due in part to the low prevalence of this complication, there remains no reliable way to predict which patients will develop ION. We present a patient with sequential episodes of unilateral perioperative ION, both occurring after otherwise uncomplicated hip operations. Patients and physicians should be aware that perioperative ION after one surgery may increase the risk of ION after subsequent surgeries.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621863","annotations":[{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.818239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.796994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.709894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Vision loss","weight":0.642864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.450994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Optic neuropathy","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Ischemic optic neuropathy","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_optic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Ion Television","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television"}]}
