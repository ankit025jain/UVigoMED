{"id":9809,"title":"Mediastinectomy for management of chronic pyogranulomatous pleural disease in dogs.","abstract":"The medical records of 12 dogs with chronic pyogranulomatous pleural disease unresponsive to medical management were reviewed retrospectively. Resection of the mediastinal pleura (mediastinectomy) was performed through a median sternotomy to remove all diseased and surgically accessible mediastinal pleural tissue. Dogs were re-examined two weeks postoperatively, and long-term outcome was evaluated by contacting owners by phone. Twelve dogs underwent mediastinectomy; additional surgeries included subtotal pericardiectomy (8), lung lobectomy (4) and partial diaphragmatic resection (2). Histology of resected tissue consistently revealed neutrophilic, pyogranulomatous cellulitis/serositis. Foreign material was evident in the mediastinal tissue of five dogs and microorganisms were recovered from three dogs. Two dogs developed pneumothorax immediately postoperatively; one dog developed haemothorax one month postoperatively and was euthanased. Median follow-up time was eight months (range: 6-43?months); eleven dogs were alive and considered to be symptom-free by their owners. Mediastinectomy resulted in complete resolution of symptoms in most dogs (92 per cent) and was associated with a low incidence of major complications. The results of this study indicated that mediastinectomy results in favourable outcome for dogs with chronic pleural pyogranulomatous pleural disease unresponsive to medical management.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686857","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.814652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.760797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Lobectomy","weight":0.581814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobectomy"},{"name":"Median sternotomy","weight":0.510248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_sternotomy"},{"name":"Hemothorax","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemothorax"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.332034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.301351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.141574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Mediastinal pleura","weight":0.127246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinal_pleura"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.120224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Animal euthanasia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
