{"id":21338,"title":"The LINA cohort: Cord blood eosinophil/basophil progenitors predict respiratory outcomes in early infancy.","abstract":"Cord blood eosinophil/basophil progenitor cells (Eo/B) of high risk infants have been shown to predict respiratory illnesses in infancy. Here we investigated this association in a population-based cohort. Furthermore, we analysed whether newborns Th1/Th2 balance and prenatal environmental exposure impact Eo/B recruitment.In a sub-cohort of the LINA study cord blood mononuclear cells were used for methylcellulose assays to assess Eo/B differentiation. Questionnaires were recorded during pregnancy and annually thereafter. Volatile organic compounds were measured during pregnancy and cord blood cytokines after ex vivo stimulation.Cord blood IL-4 and IL-13 positively correlated with Eo/B. Tobacco smoke related benzene was also positively associated with Eo/B. Enhanced Eo/B numbers increased the risk for wheezing within the first 24 months.The association between cord blood Eo/B and respiratory illnesses is not restricted to high-risk children. Prenatal environmental exposure and a Th2 milieu at birth contribute to Eo/B recruitment.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607604","annotations":[{"name":"Benzene","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.764423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.745488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.523943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.479264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Interleukin 13","weight":0.376702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_13"},{"name":"Volatile organic compound","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound"},{"name":"Wheeze","weight":0.283171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeze"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.252309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.239606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.215536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.203192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.180374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Smoke","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.070898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Volatility (chemistry)","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Cord blood","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_blood"},{"name":"Taxonomic rank","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Thorium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"}]}
