{"id":27604,"title":"Review of clinical practice guidelines for the management of LDL-related risk.","abstract":"Managing risk related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is vital in therapy for patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events given its important etiologic role in atherogenesis. Despite decades of research showing reduction of ASCVD risk with multiple approaches to lowering of LDL cholesterol, there continue to be significant gaps in care with inadequate numbers of patients receiving standard of care lipid-lowering therapy. Confusion regarding implementation of the multiple published clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one contributor to suboptimal management of LDL-related risk. This review summarizes the current guidelines for reduction of LDL-related cardiovascular risk provided by a number of major professional societies, which have broad applicability to diverse populations worldwide. Statements have varied in the process and methodology of development of recommendations, the grading system for level and strength of evidence, the inclusion or exclusion of expert opinion, the suggested ASCVD risk assessment tool, the lipoproteins recommended for risk assessment, and the lipoprotein targets of therapy. The similarities and differences among important guidelines in the United States and internationally are discussed, with recommendations for future strategies to improve consistency in approaches to LDL-related ASCVD risk and to reduce gaps in implementation of evidence-based therapies.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25011724","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.7403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.65757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.639777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.504527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.472115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Mental confusion","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_confusion"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.152918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.131006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0625525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.0256641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Expert witness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_witness"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
