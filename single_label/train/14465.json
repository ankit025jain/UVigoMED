{"id":14465,"title":"[Comparison of seizure induced by different drugs in ICR Mice].","abstract":"To compare seizure induced by different epileptic drugs in ICR mice.Male adult ICR mice were injected with pilocarpine (Pilo), kainic acid (KA) and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) to induce status epilepticus (SE). After 2 h of SE, seizures were terminated by injection of diazepam. Mice were sacrificed and sectioned for assessment of neuronal cell death by Fluro-Jade B staining after 7 d and mossy fiber sprouting by Timm staining after 28 d, respectively. Spontaneous seizures were detected by video for 28 d.Pilo and KA induced typical SE in ICR mice, which was identical to those observed in rats and C57/BL6 mice. Timm staining showed evident mossy fiber sprouting in both Pilo and KA treated mice. The incidences of spontaneous seizure were 57.1% and 35.7% in Pilo and KA treated mice, respectively. Mice treated with PTZ represented kindling model. No mossy fiber sprouting and spontaneous seizures were observed. No cell death was detected in all three groups.Similar seizure pattern is observed in ICR mice as in rats and C57/BL6 mice. Both Pilo and KA model are the ideal models for chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. ICR mice can be widely used as a cheaper substitute in epilepsy research.","date":"2014-01-14","categories":"Animal
