{"id":65919,"title":"Image guidance in prostate cancer - can offline corrections be an effective substitute for daily online imaging?","abstract":"This aim of this study was to determine if a less resource-intensive and established offline correction protocol - the No Action Level (NAL) protocol was as effective as daily online corrections of setup deviations in curative high-dose radiotherapy of prostate cancer.A total of 683 daily megavoltage CT (MVCT) or kilovoltage CT (kvCBCT) images of 30 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy were evaluated. Daily image-guidance was performed and setup errors in three translational axes recorded. The NAL protocol was simulated by using the mean shift calculated from the first five fractions and implemented on all subsequent treatments. Using the imaging data from the remaining fractions, the daily residual error (RE) was determined. The proportion of fractions where the RE was greater than 3,5 and 7 mm was calculated, and also the actual PTV margin that would be required if the offline protocol was followed.Using the NAL protocol reduced the systematic but not the random errors. Corrections made using the NAL protocol resulted in small and acceptable RE in the mediolateral (ML) and superoinferior (SI) directions with 46/533 (8.1%) and 48/533 (5%) residual shifts above 5 mm. However; residual errors greater than 5mm in the anteroposterior (AP) direction remained in 181/533 (34%) of fractions. The PTV margins calculated based on residual errors were 5mm, 5mm and 13 mm in the ML, SI and AP directions respectively.Offline correction using the NAL protocol resulted in unacceptably high residual errors in the AP direction, due to random uncertainties of rectal and bladder filling. Daily online imaging and corrections remain the standard image guidance policy for highly conformal radiotherapy of prostate cancer.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Male Urogenital
