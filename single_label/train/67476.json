{"id":67476,"title":"Alemtuzumab and sirolimus in renal transplantation: six-year results of a single-arm prospective pilot study.","abstract":"mTOR inhibitors avoid calcineurin nephrotoxicity, but sirolimus de novo is associated with unacceptable side effects and higher rejection rates. We have investigated a modified strategy: alemtuzumab induction with tacrolimus and mycophenolate maintenance, switching from tacrolimus to sirolimus at 6 months and stopping mycophenolate at 12 months. Here, we report the 6-year follow-up of 30 patients prospectively recruited to this single-arm pilot study and compare outcomes to a matched contemporaneous control group of 30 patients who received standard induction and calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppression.Six-year patient and graft survival were 83% and 80%(alemtuzumab) versus 77% and 70% (control). Rejection rates in the first 6 months were similar in alemtuzumab (6.6%) and control groups (10%). A higher than expected incidence of rejection in the alemtuzumab group following cessation of mycophenolate at 1 year (17%) was mitigated in later patients by retaining low dose mycophenolate. Mean eGFR was higher in the alemtuzumab group at all time points but not significantly (pÂ¼0.16). Tacrolimus levels in the first 6 months were significantly higher in the contemporaneous control group (p<0.001). Alemtuzumab induction with initial treatment with tacrolimus enables conversion to sirolimus without the side effects and incidence of acute rejection seen in earlier protocols.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612687","annotations":[{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.82011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Alemtuzumab","weight":0.801907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alemtuzumab"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.625212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.606934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Calcineurin","weight":0.590517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcineurin"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.586821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Mycophenolic acid","weight":0.44239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolic_acid"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.440985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.431296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.379776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.350122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.332137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.123648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"}]}
