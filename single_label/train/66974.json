{"id":66974,"title":"Robotic surgery in pediatric urology.","abstract":"Minimally invasive laparoscopic procedures for urological diseases in children have proven to be safe and effective, with outcomes comparable to open procedures. Technical advances, including improved instruments and high-definition cameras, have contributed to the expanded role of minimal invasive surgery (MIS) in children. The major drawback to laparoscopy has been the relatively steep learning curve due to the technical difficulties of suturing and the limitations of instrument dexterity and range of motion. Recently, robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RAS) has gained popularity in both adult and pediatric urology. RAS has several advantages over conventional laparoscopic surgery, particularly in the improved exposure via magnified 3-dimensional view and simplification of suturing with the increased degree of freedom and movement of the robotic arm. This review discusses the role of RAS in pediatric urology and provides technical aspects of RAS in specific urologic procedures as well.
