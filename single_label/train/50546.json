{"id":50546,"title":"Counterpoint: Establishing consensus in the diagnosis of GDM following the HAPO study.","abstract":"The International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) recommended a new protocol of 1-step testing with a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test for gestational diabetes in 2010. Since that time, these recommendations have been carefully scrutinized and accepted by a variety of organizations, but challenged or rejected by others. In the current review, we present more details regarding the background to the development of the IADPSG recommendations and seek to place them in context with the available epidemiologic and randomized controlled trial data. In this \"counterpoint,\" we also provide specific rebuttal for errors of fact and disputed contentions provided by Long and Cundy in their 2013 article in Current Diabetes Reports.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777652","annotations":[{"name":"Gestational diabetes","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.856854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.676651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.508726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus and pregnancy","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_and_pregnancy"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.121852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Counterpoint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Rebuttal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebuttal"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Question of fact","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_of_fact"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"The International (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(film)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"International Association for Professional Base Ball Players","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_for_Professional_Base_Ball_Players"},{"name":"GNOME Display Manager","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Display_Manager"}]}
