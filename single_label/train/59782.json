{"id":59782,"title":"[JAK2V617F mutation and TNF-? expression in myeloproliferative neoplasms and their correlation].","abstract":"This study was aimed to explore the JAK2V617F mutation and TNF-? expression in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), and the relation between them so as to provide theoretical basis for clinical practice and target therapy. Sixty-two confirmed BCR-ABL-negative MPN patients and 15 healthy adults were enrolled in this study. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the patients and healthy controls were divided into two parts, one part was used to extract DNA, the other one was used to extract mRNA and reverse-transcribe into cDNA. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR was used to detect JAK2V617F mutation proportion and the expression level of TNF-?. The results showed that the positive rate of JAK2V617F mutation in MPN patients was 64.52% (40/62) , including 54.28% in essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients (19/35), 94.74% in polycythemia vera (PV) patients (18/19) and 37.50% in myelofibrosis (MF) (3/8) patients. Mutation proportions of JAK2V617F in ET, PV and MF patients were 0.838 ± 0.419, 4.417 ± 0.658, 2.746 ± 2.009 respectively. The expression of TNF-? in ET, PV and MF patients were higher than that in healthy controls: 1.7, 7.0, 8.2-fold (P < 0.05) respectively. In addition, TNF-? expression was correlated with JAK2V617F allele burden (Pearson r = 0.610,R(2) = 0.372,P = 0.005). It is concluded that TNF-? plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MPN, the TNF-? expression increases and is different in ET,PV and MF patients,which correlates with JAK2V617F allele burden.
