{"id":52698,"title":"LBP-4a improves insulin resistance via translocation and activation of GLUT4 in OLETF rats.","abstract":"Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) has been shown to ameliorate insulin resistance, but the identification of compounds from LBP and the mechanisms have not been clarified. In this study, LBP-4a was purified from Lycium barbarum by DEAE cellulose and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography, and the effects of LBP-4a on insulin resistance were investigated. The results indicated that LBP-4a caused translocation of the glucose transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4) to the cell surface, which in turn stimulated glucose uptake, and the effect was sensitive to wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), and SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK (?, ?)). Furthermore, the effects of LBP-4a on p38 MAPK activities were abrogated by pretreatment of rat adipocytes using SB203580. In summary, LBP-4a improved insulin resistance via translocation and activation of GLUT4 in OLETF rats, and the activation of PI3-K and p38 MAPK contributed to these effects.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24577527","annotations":[{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.874738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cellulose","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoinositide_3-kinase"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Adipocyte","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipocyte"},{"name":"Glucose transporter","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_transporter"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.659502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate","weight":0.631972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol_4,5-bisphosphate"},{"name":"Inositol trisphosphate","weight":0.597532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_trisphosphate"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"GLUT4","weight":0.542297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLUT4"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.518451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Mitogen","weight":0.463556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen"},{"name":"Wortmannin","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wortmannin"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.310686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.187384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Glucose uptake","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_uptake"},{"name":"Protein targeting","weight":0.105708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_targeting"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Column chromatography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_chromatography"},{"name":"P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"}]}
