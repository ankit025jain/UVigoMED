{"id":78663,"title":"[Rapid specific IgE assay (ImmunoCAP® RAPID) and skin prick test in the diagnosis of allergic disease].","abstract":"ImmunoCAP® Rapid is a rapid test kit to measure the allergen-specific IgE to the eight major inhalation allergen (cat, mite, orchard grass, ragweed, wormwood, dog, cockroach, Japan cedar).We performed ImmunoCAP® Rapid 83 patients with allergic disease (26 males, 57 females, median aged 43 years, 53 of asthma, 43 of allergic rhinitis) in our allergy center. ImmunoCAP® Rapid results were compared with those of skin prick test (SPT).Although total positive allergens of SPT were higher than that of ImmunoCAP® Rapid (26.5% vs 22.5%, p<0.05), there was no significantly difference of each positive allergen between two tests. The rate of ImmunoCAP® Rapid to Japan cedar was almost equivalent to SPT in all patients (68.7% vs 55.4%, p=0.07). In contrast, the rate of ImmunoCAP® Rapid to Japan cedar was higher than SPT in patients with rhinitis (90.4% vs 71.4%, p<0.05). Efficiency between ImmunoCAP® Rapid and SPT was 86.4%, sensitivity was 66.9%, and specificity was 93.4%. The reactivity of ImmunoCAP® Rapid to allergens significantly correlated with sizes of SPT (erythema: r=0.645, urticaria: r=0.657).Although identification rate in the screening ImmunoCAP® Rapid slightly inferior to SPT, this test system was useful for diagnosis of Japan cedar and mite.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608652","annotations":[{"name":"Mite","weight":0.910198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ragweed","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragweed"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Cockroach","weight":0.776726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach"},{"name":"Urticaria","weight":0.754493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticaria"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Grass","weight":0.64808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.629401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.628826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Orchard","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Artemisia vulgaris","weight":0.137869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_vulgaris"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.119465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Dactylis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactylis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cedrus","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedrus"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"}]}
