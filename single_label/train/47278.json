{"id":47278,"title":"[Perspective of personalized (precise) cancer therapy based on predictive biomarkers].","abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase, triggers a downstream signaling cascade through areas such as the RAS-RAF-MAPK, PI3K-AKT and JAK-STAT pathways, which are involved in cell proliferation, dedifferentiation and inhibition of apoptosis. Two anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab and panitumumab, are currently available for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. KRAS is a validated predictive biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy and tumor KRAS status should be determined whenever anti-EGFR therapy is considered in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. On the other hand, the promising biomarkers such as NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA for anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, and pVEGF-A for bevacizumab have been reported. We review the biomarkers associated with personalized therapy in colorectal cancer.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597345","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Panitumumab","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panitumumab"},{"name":"Cetuximab","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetuximab"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Receptor tyrosine kinase","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.858625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.855207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"KRAS","weight":0.846894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.845212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.817921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.78525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.623117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Inositol trisphosphate","weight":0.302288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_trisphosphate"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.261516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.139479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.0593868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma_RAS_viral_oncogene_homolog"},{"name":"PIK3CA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIK3CA"},{"name":"Biochemical cascade","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_cascade"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Personalized medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
