{"id":52800,"title":"Real-time ultrasound elastography for differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid nodules: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The clinical challenge of managing thyroid nodules nowadays is to diagnose the minority of malignant disease. Real-time ultrasound elastography, which can measure tissue elasticity, is used as a complement to conventional sonography for improving the diagnosis of thyroid tumors. There are 2 common criteria for evaluating an elastogram: the elasticity score and strain ratio. This meta-analysis was performed to expand on a previous meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic power of ultrasound elastography in differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules for elasticity score and strain ratio assessment.The MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases up to January 31, 2013, were searched. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and summary receiver operating characteristic curve were obtained from individual studies with a random-effects model. The extent and sources of heterogeneity were explored.A total of 5481 nodules in 4468 patients for elasticity score studies and 1063 nodules in 983 patients for strain ratio studies were analyzed. The overall mean sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound elastography for differentiation of thyroid nodules were 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.81) and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.76-0.79) for elasticity score assessment and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81-0.89) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.77-0.83) for strain ratio assessment, respectively. The areas under the curve for the elasticity score and strain ratio were 0.8941 and 0.9285.These results confirmed those obtained in the previous meta-analysis. Ultrasound elastography has high sensitivity and specificity for identification of thyroid nodules. It is a promising tool for reducing unnecessary fine-needle-aspiration biopsy.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24567461","annotations":[{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.823007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.782792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.670183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.514563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Elastography","weight":0.499795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastography"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.328474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Thyroid nodule","weight":0.119542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_nodule"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Power (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"}]}
