{"id":61939,"title":"Leukemia propagating cells Akt up.","abstract":"Individual cancer cells can exhibit striking differences in tumorigenic potential following experimental transplantation, but the molecular pathways that regulate this activity remain poorly understood. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Blackburn and colleagues report that Akt signaling regulates both leukemia-propagating potential and proliferation rate via distinct pathways in T-ALL.
