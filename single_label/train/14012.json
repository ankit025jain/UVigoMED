{"id":14012,"title":"Cubital subchondral joint space width and CT osteoabsorptiometry in dogs with and without fragmented medial coronoid process.","abstract":"To evaluate subchondral joint space width measurements (SJSW) and CT-osteoabsorptiometry (CTOAM) measurements in the elbow of dogs with naturally occurring fragmented medial coronoid process (FMCP) preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively, and to compare these to normal dogs.Prospective randomized clinical trial.Large breed dogs <1 year of age (n = 15).Arthroscopic FMCP debridement was performed, followed by randomization to a proximal ulnar ostectomy with IM pin (PUO). CTs were performed pre-operatively and 6 months post-operatively. CTOAM and SJSW measurements were acquired in 7 locations within the joint and compared to an age-matched normal control group. Pearson correlation was performed on SJSW and CTOAM measurements. A linear mixed model determined the effect of disease and treatment on SJSW and CTOAM measurements.Fifteen dogs (28 elbows) with FMCP participated (11 arthroscopic FMCP removal, 17 with additional PUO). Data were normally distributed. Pearson correlation between CTOAM and SJSW measurements showed moderate to strong negative correlation in the control dogs. Preoperatively, affected elbows had lower medial compartment and higher lateral coronoid process CTOAM values than normal elbows. After treatment, CTOAM values of the medial compartment increased to normal. Treatment with PUO did not affect SJSW or CTOAM.Our data agree with these previous studies suggesting lower subchondral plate mineralization in dogs affected by FMCP. Arthroscopy may result in higher CTOAM values secondary to increased loading.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450284","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.441745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.436916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.374485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Mixed model","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.344907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.272246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.247433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.241174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Epiphysis","weight":0.219076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.174363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0768393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Habitat fragmentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Medial compartment of thigh","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_compartment_of_thigh"}]}
