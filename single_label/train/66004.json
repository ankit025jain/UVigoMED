{"id":66004,"title":"Prostate cancer deaths and incident cases among American Indian/Alaska Native men, 1999-2009.","abstract":"We linked databases to improve identification of American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) in determining prostate cancer death and incidence rates.We linked prostate cancer mortality and incidence data with Indian Health Service (IHS) patient records; analyses focused on residents of IHS Contract Health Service Delivery Area (CHSDA) counties. We calculated age-adjusted incidence and death rates for AI/AN and White men for 1999 to 2009; men of Hispanic origin were excluded.Prostate cancer death rates were higher for AI/AN men than for White men. Death rates declined for White men (-3.0% per year) but not for AI/AN men. AI/AN men had lower prostate cancer incidence rates than White men. Incidence rates declined among Whites (-2.2% per year) and AI/ANs (-1.9% per year).AI/AN men had higher prostate cancer death rates and lower prostate cancer incidence rates than White men. Disparities in accessing health care could contribute to mortality differences, and incidence differences could be related to lower prostate-specific antigen testing rates among AI/AN men.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754659","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.719464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.636741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.468348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.457586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.444734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Indian Health Service","weight":0.4162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Health_Service"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.395022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.368018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.363138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.347131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.157988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Native Americans in the United States","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"Information Technology Infrastructure Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Delivery (commerce)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delivery_(commerce)"}]}
