{"id":28708,"title":"A 'symptom-triggered' approach to  alcohol withdrawal management.","abstract":"In acute hospital settings, alcohol withdrawal often causes significant management problems and complicates a wide variety of concurrent conditions, placing a huge burden on the NHS. A significant number of critical incidents around patients who were undergoing detoxification in a general hospital setting led to the need for a project to implement and evaluate an evidence-based approach to the management of alcohol detoxification-a project that included a pre-intervention case note audit, the implementation of an evidence-based symptom-triggered detoxification protocol, and a post-intervention case note audit. This change in practice resulted in an average reduction of almost 60% in length of hospital stay and a 66% reduction in the amount of chlordiazepoxide used in detoxification, as well as highlighting that 10% of the sample group did not display any signs of withdrawal and did not require any medication. Even with these reductions, no patient post-intervention developed any severe signs of withdrawal phenomena, such as seizures or delirium tremens. The savings to the trust (The Pennine Acute Hospital Trust) are obvious,but the development of a consistent, quality service will lead to fewer long-term negative effects for patients that can be caused by detoxification. This work is a project evaluation of a locally implemented strategy, which, it was hypothesised,would improve care by providing an individualised treatment plan for the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809146","annotations":[{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Delirium tremens","weight":0.72372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium_tremens"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Delirium","weight":0.600766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.464781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.352588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alcohol withdrawal syndrome","weight":0.202918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal_syndrome"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Detoxification","weight":0.129985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Chlordiazepoxide","weight":0.108635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlordiazepoxide"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0375437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Pennine Alps","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennine_Alps"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"NHS trust","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_trust"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Trust law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Trust (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"}]}
