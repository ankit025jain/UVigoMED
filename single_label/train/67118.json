{"id":67118,"title":"Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to prostate and pelvic nodes-is pelvic lymph node coverage adequate with fiducial-based image-guided radiotherapy?","abstract":"There remains concern regarding the use of fiducial-based image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) in patients with high-risk prostate cancer also undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to pelvic nodes. By a retrospective study, we aim to ascertain the impact of the use of fiducial-based IGRT on lymph node planned target volume (PTV) coverage.30 consecutive IMRT prostate and pelvic node plans were reviewed, and dose was recalculated with 1-mm increment movements in anterior, posterior, superior, inferior, right and left directions up to 10?mm. All patients were treated with a full bladder after drinking 450-750?ml of water and empty rectum with the use of sodium citrate enemas daily. Dose-volume histogram parameters were recorded at each position, specifically nodal PTV V95%, V99% and V100%. A local IGRT database was used to identify the likelihood of a particular bony to fiducial offset in all directions. The combined data were used to calculate the percentage risk of underdosing the lymph node PTV on any given fraction.The likelihood of an offset in the left, right and anterior directions occurring and resulting in a failure to cover the PTV was <0.25%. The likelihood of a posterior offset occurring and resulting in inadequate coverage was slightly higher but remained <1%.This study confirms the safety of fiducial-based image-guided IMRT (IG-IMRT) with a strict bowel and bladder protocol, allowing a reduction of the clinical target volume to PTV margin of the prostate volume and consequent reduction in rectal toxicity.This study strengthens the evidence supporting the safe implementation of fiducial-based IG-IMRT treating the prostate and pelvic nodes in high-risk prostate cancer.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646126","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.812309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.810951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.786648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.728461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.617732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.462611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Citrate","weight":0.442846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrate"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.439645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.390028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.233715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.193782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Enema","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enema"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.147108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
