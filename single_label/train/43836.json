{"id":43836,"title":"Comparison of nucleostemin gene expression in CD133+ and CD133- cell population in colon cancer cell line HT29.","abstract":"Nucleostemin has been shown to be essential for proliferation and survival of colon cancer cells. In this study, we evaluate and comparing nucleostemin expression in CD133+ and CD133- colon cancer cell line HT29.After preparation and culturing of HT29 cell line, isolation was performed using magnetic cell separation system by CD133 MicroBeads and phycoerythrin conjugated to monoclonal anti-human CD133 monoclonal antibody and analyzed with flow cytometry. For quantitative expression of nucleostemin in HT29, CD133+ and CD133- cells used specific nucleostemin primer and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase primer as endogenous control.The results showed the percentage of CD133+ cells in HT29 colon cancer cell line ranged from 36.5% to 41.5%, whereas the percentage of CD133- cell ranged from 58.5% to 63.5%. The expression rate of nucleostemin in HT29, CD133+ and CD133- cells were 1.44 ± 0.78, 1.60 ± 0.70 and 1.00 ± 0.18 (respectively). The comparison of expression rate represents no significant difference in nucleostemin expression in CD133+, CD133- and HT29 colon cancer cells.It is concluded that nucleostemin expression could not be specific in a certain type of cells in colon cancer cell line HT29 and controlling strategies in colon cancer must not be focused on one certain type of colon cancer cells as main expressing nucleostemin gene.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762489","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.847128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.815511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.635228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.525444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.445666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.419755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.214159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Phycoerythrin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycoerythrin"},{"name":"CD133","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD133"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Haiti","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Misanthropy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misanthropy"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Glyceraldehyde","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyceraldehyde"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"}]}
