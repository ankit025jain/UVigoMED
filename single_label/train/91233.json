{"id":91233,"title":"The influence of injury cause, contact-sport participation, and personal knowledge on expectation of outcome from mild traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"This study investigated the influence of injury cause, contact-sport participation, and prior knowledge of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) on injury beliefs and chronic symptom expectations of mTBI.A total of 185 non-contact-sport players (non-CSPs) and 59 contact-sport players (CSPs) with no history of mTBI were randomly allocated to one of two conditions in which they read either a vignette depicting a sport-related mTBI (mTBIsport) or a motor-vehicle-accident-related mTBI (mTBIMVA). The vignettes were otherwise standardized to convey the same injury parameters (e.g., duration of loss of consciousness). After reading a vignette, participants reported their injury beliefs (i.e., perceptions of injury undesirability, chronicity, and consequences) and their expectations of chronic postconcussion syndrome (PCS) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.Non-CSPs held significantly more negative beliefs and expected greater PTSD symptomatology and greater PCS affective symptomatology from an mTBIMVA vignette thann mTBIsport vignette, but this difference was not found for CSPs. Unlike CSPs, non-CSPs who personally knew someone who had sustained an mTBI expected significantly less PCS symptomatology than those who did not. Despite these different results for non-CSPs and CSPs, overall, contact-sport participation did not significantly affect injury beliefs and symptom expectations from an mTBIsport.Expectations of persistent problems after an mTBI are influenced by factors such as injury cause even when injury parameters are held constant. Personal knowledge of mTBI, but not contact sport participation, may account for some variability in mTBI beliefs and expectations. These factors require consideration when assessing mTBI outcome.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24527996","annotations":[{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.873842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.722957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Affect (psychology)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)"},{"name":"Unconsciousness","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.258217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"History","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Post-concussion syndrome","weight":0.0627902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-concussion_syndrome"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Sketch comedy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy"},{"name":"Contact sport","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_sport"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Standardized test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test"},{"name":"Reading (process)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_(process)"}]}
