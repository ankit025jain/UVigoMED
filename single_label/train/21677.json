A questionnaire was used to evaluate risk factors.Fifty six (11%) tested positive. In children born in Belgium, with parents from Belgium, 13 (3,2%) tested positive. In children born in a foreign country, 20 (60%) tested positive; if born in Belgium but 1 or 2 parents were from a foreign country, 15 (30%) tested positive. Differences were significant (p <0.001). In the multivariate analyses, significant risk factors were staying in a day nursery, a birthplace of child or father outside Belgium, and lower education levels of mother.In this cohort of Belgian asymptomatic children and young adults, the prevalence of H. pylori infection is 11%, ranging from 3,2% in Belgian born children with Belgian parents to 60% in children born in high prevalence countries from foreign parents. The most significant risk factor found in this study was origin.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592540","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.613579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.522707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.404556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.278391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.160085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Belgium","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.114525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Day care","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_care"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Education in Greece","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Greece"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"}]}
