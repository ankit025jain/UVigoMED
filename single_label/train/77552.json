{"id":77552,"title":"[Smoking and occupational stressors in firefighters, 2011].","abstract":"To analyze the prevalence of smoking in firefighters and associated factors.Cross sectional study of 711 firefighters in Belo Horizonte, MG, Southeastern Brazil, in 2011. The data were obtained using a self-applied structured questionnaire, which included sociodemographic characteristics, occupational stressors, health status and adverse life events. Smoking was analyzed as a dichotomous variable (multiple logistic regression).The prevalence of smoking among firefighters was 7.6%. Currently smoking status was associated with low levels of schooling, a monthly income in the middle band, the existence of psychiatric problems in the past, high exposure to traumatic events in life, social discrimination, occupational stressors and low demand at work.The low prevalence of smoking indicates the relevance of employment conditions in explaining harmful habits and health. Organizational and operational stressors contribute independently to explaining current smoking status in the population studied.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626494","annotations":[{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.569436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.348449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.269423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"School","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.130893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Firefighter","weight":0.128335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Dichotomy","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Belo Horizonte","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Horizonte"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"711","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/711"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"MG Cars","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_Cars"},{"name":"Belo","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Southeastern United States","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Horizonte","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizonte"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"}]}
