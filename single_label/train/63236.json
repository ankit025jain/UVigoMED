{"id":63236,"title":"Sustained donor engraftment in recipients of double-unit cord blood transplantation is possible despite donor-specific human leukoctye antigen antibodies.","abstract":"The impact of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) donor-specific antibodies (DSA) on cord blood (CB) engraftment is controversial. We evaluated the influence of pre-existing HLA-antibodies (HLA-Abs) on engraftment in 82 double-unit CB recipients (median age, 48 years) who underwent transplantation for hematologic malignancies. Of 28 patients (34%) with HLA-Abs, 12 had DSA (median mean fluorescence intensity 5255; range, 1057 to 9453). DSA patients had acute leukemia (n = 11) or myelodysplasia (n = 1) and all received either high-dose or reduced-intensity (but myeloablative) conditioning. After myeloablative CB transplantation (CBT) (n = 67), sustained donor engraftment was observed in 95% without HLA-Abs (median, 23 days), 100% with nonspecific HLA-Abs (median, 23 days), and 92% with DSA (median, 31 days, P = .48). Of 6 patients with HLA-Abs to 1 unit, 3 engrafted with that unit and 3 with the other. Of 6 patients with HLA-Abs against both units, 1 had graft failure despite being 100% donor, and 5 engrafted with 1 unit. Successful donor engraftment is possible in patients with DSA after myeloablative double-unit CBT. Our data suggest potential deleterious effects of DSA can be abrogated in patients with hematologic malignancies.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462980","annotations":[{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.828625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cord blood","weight":0.502548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_blood"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.369643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.315279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Order of the Bath","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1057","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1057"},{"name":"Stem cell controversy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_controversy"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Digital Signature Algorithm","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
