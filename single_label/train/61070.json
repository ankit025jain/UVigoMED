{"id":61070,"title":"Sarcoidosis as a systemic disease.","abstract":"Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease, where for the abnormal localized collections of chronic inflammatory cells, the granuloma is cardinal, which may result in the formation of nodule(s) in the tissue of any organ of the body, with lungs and lymph nodes involvement being the most common. The granulomas are nonnecrotizing. The disease may either be asymptomatic or chronic. Its onset is gradual and may improve or clear up spontaneously. Clinical features of specific and nonspecific cutaneous lesions are described, emphasizing their role as a prelude to its systemic manifestations, afflicting respiratory, liver, spleen, musculoskeletal, ocular, cardiac, and neurologic systems. The salient briefs of diagnostic procedures are outlined, in addition to historical background and etiopathogenesis. Several currently available treatment modalities are outlined for instant reference.
