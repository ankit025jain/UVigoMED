{"id":34261,"title":"HD CAGnome: a search tool for huntingtin CAG repeat length-correlated genes.","abstract":"The length of the huntingtin (HTT) CAG repeat is strongly correlated with both age at onset of Huntington's disease (HD) symptoms and age at death of HD patients. Dichotomous analysis comparing HD to controls is widely used to study the effects of HTT CAG repeat expansion. However, a potentially more powerful approach is a continuous analysis strategy that takes advantage of all of the different CAG lengths, to capture effects that are expected to be critical to HD pathogenesis.We used continuous and dichotomous approaches to analyze microarray gene expression data from 107 human control and HD lymphoblastoid cell lines. Of all probes found to be significant in a continuous analysis by CAG length, only 21.4% were so identified by a dichotomous comparison of HD versus controls. Moreover, of probes significant by dichotomous analysis, only 33.2% were also significant in the continuous analysis. Simulations revealed that the dichotomous approach would require substantially more than 107 samples to either detect 80% of the CAG-length correlated changes revealed by continuous analysis or to reduce the rate of significant differences that are not CAG length-correlated to 20% (n?=?133 or n?=?206, respectively). Given the superior power of the continuous approach, we calculated the correlation structure between HTT CAG repeat lengths and gene expression levels and created a freely available searchable website, \"HD CAGnome,\" that allows users to examine continuous relationships between HTT CAG and expression levels of ?20,000 human genes.Our results reveal limitations of dichotomous approaches compared to the power of continuous analysis to study a disease where human genotype-phenotype relationships strongly support a role for a continuum of CAG length-dependent changes. The compendium of HTT CAG length-gene expression level relationships found at the HD CAGnome now provides convenient routes for discovery of candidates influenced by the HD mutation.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751919","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.651267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.455971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.369202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.32868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.189677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Dichotomy","weight":0.0547481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.054285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Huntingtin","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingtin"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Search algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Compendium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compendium"},{"name":"The Huntingtons","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Huntingtons"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Horse length","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length"},{"name":"Patriot movement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_movement"},{"name":"High-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Discovery (observation)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation)"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Strongly correlated material","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_correlated_material"},{"name":"Continuum (theory)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(theory)"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"}]}
