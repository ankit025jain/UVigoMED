{"id":43654,"title":"T-cell receptor recognition of HLA-DQ2-gliadin complexes associated with celiac disease.","abstract":"Celiac disease is a T cell-mediated disease induced by dietary gluten, a component of which is gliadin. 95% of individuals with celiac disease carry the HLA (human leukocyte antigen)-DQ2 locus. Here we determined the T-cell receptor (TCR) usage and fine specificity of patient-derived T-cell clones specific for two epitopes from wheat gliadin, DQ2.5-glia-?1a and DQ2.5-glia-?2. We determined the ternary structures of four distinct biased TCRs specific for those epitopes. All three TCRs specific for DQ2.5-glia-?2 docked centrally above HLA-DQ2, which together with mutagenesis and affinity measurements provided a basis for the biased TCR usage. A non-germline encoded arginine residue within the CDR3? loop acted as the lynchpin within this common docking footprint. Although the TCRs specific for DQ2.5-glia-?1a and DQ2.5-glia-?2 docked similarly, their interactions with the respective gliadin determinants differed markedly, thereby providing a basis for epitope specificity.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777060","annotations":[{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.766133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.725634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Complementarity determining region","weight":0.673332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_determining_region"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Neuroglia","weight":0.649401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroglia"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.588944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Wheat","weight":0.57774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"},{"name":"Gluten","weight":0.503359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.461637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Mutagenesis","weight":0.436743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagenesis"},{"name":"Gliadin","weight":0.422041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliadin"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"HLA-DQ","weight":0.131637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-DQ"},{"name":"HLA-DQ2","weight":0.125451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-DQ2"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Linchpin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linchpin"},{"name":"Docking (molecular)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)"},{"name":"Footprint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint"},{"name":"Exocytosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocytosis"},{"name":"Fine (penalty)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty)"}]}
