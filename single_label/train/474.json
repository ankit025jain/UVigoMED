{"id":474,"title":"Leprosy--an imported disease.","abstract":"Leprosy remains a public health concern in Malaysia and globally. We aim to review the characteristics of leprosy patients in a tertiary institution in urban Malaysia.This is a case series of 27 leprosy patients who presented between 2008 and 2013.The majority of our patients consisted of male (74.1%), Malaysian (63.0%), blue collar workers (51.9%) and married (59.3%) patients; 48.1% had lepromatous leprosy. All except one of the patients presented with skin lesions, 25.9% had nerve involvement and 33.3% developed lepra reactions. Forty-four point four percent (44.4%) of the cases seen initially in the primary care setup were misdiagnosed.Doctors need to have a high index of suspicion for leprosy when patients present with suggestive skin, nerve or musculoskeletal lesions. Immigrants accounted for 37% of cases and these patients may become a reservoir of infection, thus accounting for the rise in incidence. An increasing trend in multibacillary cases may be attributed to the spread from migrants from countries with a high burden of leprosy.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509717","annotations":[{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.837412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.583977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.486252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.440396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.43624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.318153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.247804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.238135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.1385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Blue-collar worker","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-collar_worker"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Collar (clothing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collar_(clothing)"},{"name":"Lepromatous leprosy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepromatous_leprosy"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"}]}
