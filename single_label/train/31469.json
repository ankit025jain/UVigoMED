{"id":31469,"title":"The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor-Related Skin Toxicity Index (EGFRISTI): a new tool for grading and managing skin adverse reactions to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors.","abstract":"Skin toxicity is frequent and debilitating in oncologic patients treated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs). Grading and management of skin adverse events (AEs) are poorly standardized.We developed a new score (EGFRISTI: Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor-Related Skin Toxicity Index) which is able to quantify and monitor all EGFRI-related dermatologic AEs over time. The utility of this tool was validated in 130 patients treated with 5 different EGFRIs including both monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.The mean baseline EGFRISTI score was 26.9 (range: 6.0-64.5). Mild toxicity was found in 55 patients (42.3%), moderate toxicity in 43 (33.1%), and severe toxicity in 32 patients (24.6%). After the first-line toxicity treatment, an EGFRISTI score reduction of >75% was obtained in 31 patients (34.1%) and one of 50% in 40 patients (43.9%), while an improvement of <50% was observed in the remaining 20 subjects (22.0%).The EGFRISTI is a simple and reliable tool to quantify and express the severity of all clinical signs and symptoms of EGFRI skin toxicity with a single numerical value, to choose the most suitable therapy, and to measure its efficacy.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25196815","annotations":[{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.854619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.725665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.678994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.545761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.435109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.352145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.333596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.303192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.302241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.0195416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"}]}
