{"id":77549,"title":"The effect of a physical activity program on decreasing physical disability indicated by musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms among workers: a pilot study.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to verify the effect of a physical activity (PA) program on musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms in different body regions among workers.The intervention study lasted 6 months. The training sessions were given during work time. The intervention group (TOI) (n = 39) participated in 10-15 min of physical exercise training 3 times a week and focused on stretching exercises and general strength. The reference group (TOR) (n = 31) were asked to continue their daily activities. Musculoskeletal pain was assessed with the standardized Nordic questionnaires for analyzing musculoskeletal symptoms. Evaluations were performed at baseline and at the end of the intervention.After the intervention, the TOI obtained some significant results regarding a decrease in the intensity of pain in some of the body regions evaluated, such as elbow (p = .03) and dorsal region (p = .015). In comparing the TOR and TOI after the 6 months of the PA program, we can verify that in the elbow and in the thigh/hip regions, the pain intensity decreased significantly; additionally, there is some evidence to suggest statistically significant results in the neck region (p = .063).Our intervention seems to have reduced musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms in factory workers.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629870","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.499812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.364911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.269364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.199762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.197271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Stretching","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretching"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Physical disability","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_disability"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Factory","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory"},{"name":"Reference group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_group"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Tennis court","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court"},{"name":"1015","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1015"},{"name":"The Times of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Toronto Blue Jays","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Nordic countries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries"}]}
