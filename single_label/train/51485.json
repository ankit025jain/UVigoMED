{"id":51485,"title":"Diffusion-weighted MR imaging findings of ovarian adenocarcinofibromas and adenofibromas.","abstract":"We retrospectively evaluated pelvic magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of 16 ovarian lesions (5 adenocarcinofibromas, 2 borderline adenofibromas, and 9 benign adenofibromas). All adenocarcinofibromas were detected as large solid areas of strong high signal on DWI, and seven of nine benign adenofibromas and both borderline adenofibromas demonstrated no areas of high signal or small areas of weak high signal. Solid components that appear as areas of strong high signal on DWI might represent a characteristic finding of adenocarcinofibromas.
