{"id":47531,"title":"Association between preoperative glucocorticoids and long-term survival and cancer recurrence after colectomy: follow-up analysis of a previous randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"The effect of anaesthetic drugs on long-term oncological outcomes after cancer surgery is an area of current interest. Dexamethasone is widely used in anaesthetic practice; however, its effect on long-term survival and cancer outcomes is not known. This study presents the results of a 5-yr follow-up of patients receiving dexamethasone before elective colectomy as part of a previous randomized clinical trial.Sixty patients who underwent elective open colonic resection for any indication between June 2006 and March 2008 were randomized to receive either 8 mg i.v. dexamethasone or placebo before surgery. A 5-yr follow-up analysis was conducted to evaluate overall survival, disease-free survival and recurrence specifically for patients undergoing resection for Stage I-III colon cancer. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed and log-rank test was used to evaluate difference in survival between groups.Forty-three of the 60 subjects had Stage I-III colon cancer and were included in the follow-up analysis. Twenty received preoperative dexamethasone and 23 received placebo. There were no significant differences between groups in baseline or disease characteristics. No differences were found between groups for overall or disease-free survival. In the dexamethasone group, there was a significantly higher rate of distant recurrence (6 compared with 1, P=0.04).Preoperative dexamethasone was associated with a higher rate of distant recurrence in patients undergoing colectomy for colon cancer. Given the small sample size, this finding should be interpreted with caution, but warrants further investigation in a prospective study.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583820","annotations":[{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.875419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.843153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.810453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.710117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.536708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.443349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"}]}
