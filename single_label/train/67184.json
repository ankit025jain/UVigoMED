{"id":67184,"title":"Transrectal real-time tissue elastography - an effective way to distinguish benign and malignant prostate tumors.","abstract":"To investigate the relationship between extracellular matrix parameters and texture of prostatic lesions evaluated by transrectal real-time tissue elastography (TRTE).120 patients suspicious for prostate cancer underwent TRTE. Targeted biopsies were carried out after 12-core systematic biopsy. Epithelia were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and Victoria blue and Ponceau S were used to stain elastic-collagen fibers, and picric acid-sirius red for visualization of collagen type I (Col1) and III (Col3). Smooth muscles were visualized by immunohistochemistry. All image analyses were performed in a blind manner using Image Pro Plus 6.0, and the area ratios of epithelium, elastic fibers, collagen fibers and Col1/Col3 were determined.42 patients with typical elastograms were included in the final data analysis. Significant differences were detected between the benign and malignant groups in the area ratios of epithelium (P = 0.01), smooth muscles and Col1/Col3 (P = 0.04, P = 0.02, respectively). There were no significant differences in the area ratios of epithelium, smooth muscle and elastic fibers between the stiff and soft lesion groups. The area ratio of Col1 was (0.05 ± 0.03) in the stiff group, and (0.02 ± 0.01) in the soft group (P= 0.00). However, the area ratio of Col3 was (0.03 ± 0.02) in the stiff group, and (0.05 ± 0.04) in the soft group (P = 0.16). Col1/Col3 in the stiff group (1.99 ± 1.59) was greater than in the soft group (0.71 ± 0.64) (P = 0.01).Tissue hardness of prostatic tumors was mainly dependent on the Col1 content, Col1/Col3 being higher in malignant than in benign lesions, so the prostate tissue texture can be used as a target for distinguishing between the two with TRTE.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641417","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.774734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.762797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Type-I collagen","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-I_collagen"},{"name":"Elastic fiber","weight":0.536424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_fiber"},{"name":"Elastography","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastography"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.371845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Victoria (Australia)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Hardness","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness"}]}
