{"id":50183,"title":"Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A? mass level is increased in elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"OBJECTIVE. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A? (Lp-PLA?) is extensively expressed by advanced atherosclerotic lesions and may play a role in plaque instability. We selected a group of elderly subjects that underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or balloon angioplasty (BA) and separated them into two groups, diabetic and nondiabetic, to compare the level of Lp-PLA? mass between them. METHODS. 44 patients aged 79.6 ± 5.6 years with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis underwent TAVI (n = 35) or BA (n = 9). 21 subjects had confirmed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lp-PLA? mass was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (USCN Life Science, China) before and 3 days after the procedure. RESULTS. Lp-PLA? mass was significantly elevated in this population (1296 ± 358?ng/mL before TAVI; 1413 ± 268?ng/mL before BA) and further increased after TAVI (1604 ± 437?ng/mL, P < 0.01) or BA (1808 ± 303?ng/mL, P < 0.01). Lp-PLA? mass was significantly increased on the diabetic group before these interventions. CONCLUSION. Lp-PLA? may be a novel biomarker for the presence of rupture-prone atherosclerotic lesions in elderly patients. Levels of Lp-PLA? in diabetic patients may accompany the higher amount of small dense LDL particles seen in these subjects.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818163","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.912945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Aortic valve stenosis","weight":0.79188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_stenosis"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.737917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.667055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.638202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.445331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.349784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.29978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.295401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"China","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Bachelor of Arts","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"},{"name":"Atheroma","weight":0.042255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheroma"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"1808","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1808"},{"name":"1604","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1604"},{"name":"1413","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1413"},{"name":"1296","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1296"},{"name":"303","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/303"},{"name":"268","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/268"},{"name":"358","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/358"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Play (activity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Valvular heart disease","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valvular_heart_disease"}]}
