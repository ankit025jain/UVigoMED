{"id":80516,"title":"Cardiac hydatid disease, case report, and review of literature.","abstract":"Cardiac Hydatidosis is a rare but potentially very serious complication of hydatid disease. It is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to the variability of signs and symptoms at presentation. A case of disseminated hydatidosis, affecting the heart muscle, which failed to surgical evacuation and followed by spread to the brain and elsewhere in the body, is presented, discussed, together with a review of the literature. The disease, hydatididosis, remains a challenge even in our days. Systematic radical control in the Middle East is required. Alternative surgical options include heart transplantation when the disease affects the heart muscles and there is more than one cyst which fails to surgical evacuation.
