{"id":33448,"title":"Novel compound heterozygous mutations in the desmoplakin gene cause hair shaft abnormalities and culminate in lethal cardiomyopathy.","abstract":"A 2-month-old white girl born to nonconsanguineous parents presented to the dermatology department with hair loss that had commenced a few months after birth. Although her hair loss later stabilized, it remained sparse. By the age of 2 years, she was noted to have developed focal keratoderma over pressure points of the soles. Aged 5 years, she was admitted to hospital with a chest infection, and investigations at that point revealed that she had a dilated cardiomyopathy. Subsequent genetic investigations identified compound heterozygous mutations in the 3' end of the desmoplakin (DSP) gene (7567delAAGA and 6577G>A), explaining the cardiocutaneous phenotype.
