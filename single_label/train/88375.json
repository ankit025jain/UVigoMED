{"id":88375,"title":"Can ring finger injuries be prevented by pre-weakened rings? Three clinical cases.","abstract":"Prevention of finger trauma can be directly related to the manufacture of pre-weakened rings. We report on three clinical cases of finger injuries caused by pre-weakened rings. Lesions were less severe than conventional ring finger injuries, such as those caused by iron fences. Surgery was required in all three cases and chronic cold sensitivity was noted in one case. This small series advocates the imposition of a ring manufacturing standard at the European level. Given this lack of consensus, the idea is to prevent injuries by developing rings with intentional weak points that open automatically in case of trauma. These pre-weakened rings have never been subject to clinical study to demonstrate their potential safety.
