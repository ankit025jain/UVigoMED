{"id":23400,"title":"Segmental omental infarction: a rare cause of acute abdominal pain in children.","abstract":"Segmental omental infarction (SOI) is an unusual and rare cause of abdominal pain in children and is often mistaken for acute appendicitis preoperatively. SOI once diagnosed preoperatively should be treated conservatively. Surgical intervention, however, may be necessary in order to establish definitive diagnosis and treatment. We present 2 children with SOI diagnosed as acute appendicitis preoperatively. Laparoscopy established the diagnosis and treatment. Laparoscopy should be the procedure of choice in children presenting with right-sided abdominal pain that is not well established preoperatively. This is especially so in obese children. Laparoscopy not only establishes the diagnosis of SOI but laparoscopic omentectomy results in resolution of symptoms and faster recovery.
