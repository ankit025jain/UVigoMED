{"id":81915,"title":"Implant-supported mandibular denture: planning to delivery--a case report.","abstract":"Restoring the edentulous mandible with a removable prosthesis can be a challenging prospect for both the dentist and patient during and after treatment. Poor retention and support are the major problems reported with a mandibular complete denture and these can be significantly improved with the use of implants and retentive attachments. Utilizing implants requires careful planning from both the surgical and restorative aspects to ensure that the intended treatment aim and outcome is achieved.This case highlights the importance of both restorative and surgical considerations when planning the rehabilitation of the mandible with dental implants.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783882","annotations":[{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.672089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Removable partial denture","weight":0.653074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removable_partial_denture"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.325037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.249941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.167108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Retainer (orthodontics)","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retainer_(orthodontics)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Marketing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing"},{"name":"Apprenticeship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"}]}
