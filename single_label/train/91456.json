{"id":91456,"title":"Management of proximal interphalangeal joint hyperextension injuries: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"To compare the effectiveness of buddy strapping and aluminum orthosis for treatment of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint hyperextension injuries. We also evaluated the effect of age on the outcome by comparing our results in adults and children.One hundred twenty-one consecutive patients with a PIP joint hyperextension injury of the index, middle, ring, or little finger and without fracture were evaluated. Patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups. In the first group, treatment included buddy strapping of the injured finger to its neighbor noninjured finger for a week. In the second group, immobilization was secured with an aluminum extension blocking orthosis for a week in 15Â° flexion. Assessment of motion, edema, pain, and strength were performed weekly for the first month and then at 3, 6, and 12 months after injury.The patients treated with buddy strapping exhibited similar outcomes compared with those treated with aluminum orthoses. In patients with full recovery, buddy strapping allowed earlier recovery of motion and resolution of edema and pain compared with aluminum orthosis immobilization. Furthermore, PIP injuries appear to have better outcomes in children than in adults.Buddy strapping is easy and effective treatment for PIP joint hyperextension injuries.Therapeutic I.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503231","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Interphalangeal articulations of hand","weight":0.803822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interphalangeal_articulations_of_hand"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.765354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.748696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Orthotics","weight":0.704413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthotics"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.281157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Little finger","weight":0.249519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_finger"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Index finger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger"},{"name":"Strapping","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strapping"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Aluminium","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}]}
