{"id":72871,"title":"Primary cutaneous Ewing sarcoma--case report.","abstract":"Ewing sarcoma is a primitive neuroectodermal tumor rarely occurs in the skin and sobcutaneous tissues. Generally Ewing's sarcoma is a primary bone tumor, but when present in soft tissues it characterizes an extremely uncommon clinical picture. It usually involves the deep subcutaneous tissue or muscles, and more rarely occurs like a primary skin cancer. Most patients are white, women, and in the second decade of life. The clinical features are a superficial mass, in average measuring 2-3 cm, of soft consistency, freely mobile and sometimes painful. The more affected locations are upper and lower extremities, trunk, head, neck or multiple lesions. The presence of metastases is very rare.
