{"id":92563,"title":"Macrophage-derived delta-like protein 1 enhances interleukin-6 and matrix metalloproteinase 3 production by fibroblast-like synoviocytes in mice with collagen-induced arthritis.","abstract":"We previously reported that blockade of the Notch ligand delta-like protein 1 (DLL-1) suppressed osteoclastogenesis and ameliorated arthritis in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the mechanisms by which joint inflammation were suppressed have not yet been revealed. This study was undertaken to determine whether DLL-1 regulates the production of RA-related proinflammatory cytokines.Joint cells from mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and mouse fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were cultured with or without stimuli in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against Notch ligands, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of Notch receptors and ligands on mouse joint cells was determined by flow cytometry.The production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by mouse joint cells with or without stimulation was suppressed by DLL-1 blockade. DLL-1 blockade also suppressed the levels of IL-6 and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3) in the joint fluid in a mouse model of RA. However, the production of tumor necrosis factor ? and IL-1? was not suppressed by DLL-1 blockade. The production of IL-6 and MMP-3 by mouse FLS was enhanced by DLL-1 stimulation as well as Notch-2 activation. Among joint cells, DLL-1 was not expressed on mouse FLS but was expressed on macrophages.These results suggest that the interaction of DLL-1 on mouse joint macrophages with Notch-2 on mouse FLS enhances the production of IL-6 and MMP-3. Therefore, suppression of IL-6, GM-CSF, and MMP-3 production by DLL-1 blockade might be responsible for the amelioration of arthritis in a mouse model of RA.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24943093","annotations":[{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Notch signaling pathway","weight":0.818024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notch_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_macrophage_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.797842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.780391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.675509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.449442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.419455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.405764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.209583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Synovial fluid","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_fluid"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Neutralizing antibody","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"MMP3","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP3"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"}]}
