{"id":45985,"title":"Gastric cancer: The role of diffusion weighted imaging in the preoperative staging.","abstract":"Evaluate the role of diffusion-weighted-imaging (DWI) in the diagnosis and staging of gastric carcinoma.A total of 31 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, which underwent preoperative staging with 3Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), were enrolled. Two radiologists evaluated the tumor staging in DWI. Results were compared to postsurgical pathologic findings.The T factor accuracy of conventional MRI and DWI was 73% and 80% respectively; while the N staging accuracy of conventional MRI and DWI was 80% and 93%, respectively.DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values showed to be useful in preoperative staging of gastric cancer.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654696","annotations":[{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.927134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.899611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.618886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.586833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Brownian motion","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Driving under the influence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Nikola Tesla","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla"},{"name":"Analog-to-digital converter","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
