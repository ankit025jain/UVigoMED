{"id":61352,"title":"DIC score in pregnant women--a population based modification of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis score.","abstract":"The objectives of this study were: 1) To determine the component needed to generate a validated DIC score during pregnancy. 2) To validate such scoring system in the identification of patients with clinical diagnosis of DIC.This is a population based retrospective study, including all women who gave birth at the 'Soroka University Medical Center' during the study period, and have had blood coagulation tests including complete blood cell count, prothrombin time (PT)(seconds), partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, and D-dimers. Nomograms for pregnancy were established, and DIC score was constructed based on ROC curve analyses.1) maternal plasma fibrinogen concentrations increased during pregnancy; 2) maternal platelet count decreased gradually during gestation; 3) the PT and PTT values did not change with advancing gestation; 4) PT difference had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96 (p<0.001), and a PT difference ?1.55 had an 87% sensitivity and 90% specificity for the diagnosis of DIC; 5) the platelet count had an AUC of 0.87 (p<0.001), an 86% sensitivity and 71% specificity for the diagnosis of DIC; 6) fibrinogen concentrations had an AUC of 0.95 (p<0.001) and a cutoff point ?3.9 g/L had a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 92% for the development of DIC; and 7) The pregnancy adjusted DIC score had an AUC of 0.975 (p<0.001) and at a cutoff point of ?26 had a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 96%, a LR(+) of 22 and a LR(-) of 0.125 for the diagnosis of DIC.We could establish a sensitive and specific pregnancy adjusted DIC score. The positive likelihood ratio of this score suggests that a patient with a score of ?26 has a high probability to have DIC.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728139","annotations":[{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.805597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.801533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Partial thromboplastin time","weight":0.792905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_thromboplastin_time"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.791784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.760806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation","weight":0.736357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.727534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.536506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.233764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.189675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Thromboplastin","weight":0.110913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thromboplastin"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.0152163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Maternal death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death"}]}
