{"id":79086,"title":"[Social consequence of a dysphonic voice, design and validation of a questionnaire and first results].","abstract":"In our society, based on communication, dysphonia becomes a handicap that could be responsible of work discrimination. Actually, several commercial services are provided by phone only, and voice quality is mandatory for the employees. This work aim was to determine the social picture relayed by dysphonia. Our hypothesis was that dysphonia sounds pejorative compared to normal voice. 40 voice samples (30 dysphonic and 10 normal) were presented randomly to a perceptual jury of 20 na√Øve listener. The task was for each of them to fill a questionnaire, designed specifically to describe the speaker's look and personality. 20 items were evaluated, divided into 4 categories: health, temperament, appearance, and way of life. The results showed significant differences between normal subjects and dysphonic patients. For instance, the pathological voices were depicted as more tired, introverted, sloppy than normal voices, and less trustable. No significant differences were found according to the severity of voice disorders. This work is presently continued. It allowed to validate our questionnaire and has offers great perspectives on patient's management and voice therapy.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494330","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.570054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.549851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.408248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.405104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.368449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.254482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Pejorative","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.210686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Speech and language pathology","weight":0.17681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_and_language_pathology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.164972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Personality psychology","weight":0.13476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"},{"name":"Jury","weight":0.065098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury"},{"name":"Extraversion and introversion","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion"},{"name":"Temperament","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperament"},{"name":"List of voice disorders","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_voice_disorders"},{"name":"Nave","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave"},{"name":"Dysphonia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphonia"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Phonation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonation"},{"name":"Public speaking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Actually (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actually_(album)"}]}
