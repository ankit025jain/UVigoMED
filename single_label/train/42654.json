{"id":42654,"title":"Assessment of nuclear nanomorphology marker to improve the detection of malignancy from bile duct biopsy specimens.","abstract":"The accurate diagnosis of malignancy from small bile duct biopsy specimens is often challenging. This proof-of-concept study assessed the feasibility of a novel optical technology, spatial-domain low-coherence quantitative phase microscopy (SL-QPM), that assesses nanoscale structural alterations in epithelial nuclei for improving the diagnosis of malignancy in bile duct biopsy specimens.The SL-QPM analysis was performed on standard histology specimens of bile duct biopsy specimens from 45 patients. We analyzed normal cells with benign follow-up, histologically normal cells with pancreaticobiliary malignancy, and malignant epithelial cells.The SL-QPM-derived nuclear nanomorphology marker can not only distinguish benign and malignant epithelial cells but can also detect features of malignancy in those cells normal by light microscopy with a discriminatory accuracy of 0.90. When combining pathology with SL-QPM, the sensitivity is improved to 88.5% from 65.4% of conventional pathology, while maintaining 100% specificity.SL-QPM-derived nuclear nanomorphology markers represent a novel approach for detecting malignancy from histologically normal-appearing epithelial cells, with potential as an adjunctive test in patients with negative or inconclusive pathologic diagnosis on bile duct biopsy specimens.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838334","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.70516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Light microscopy","weight":0.689691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_microscopy"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.657355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.584935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.524765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.460335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.243642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Optical engineering","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_engineering"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Nanoscopic scale","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoscopic_scale"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
