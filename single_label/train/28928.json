{"id":28928,"title":"Relationship between addiction relapse and self-efficacy rates in injection drug users referred to Maintenance Therapy Center of Sari, 1391.","abstract":"Self-efficacy is the belief that one has the ability to implement the behaviors needed to produce a desired effect. There has been growing interest in the role of self-efficacy as a predictor and/or mediator of treatment outcome in number of domains. In numerous studies of substance abuse treatment, self-efficacy has emerged as an important predictor of outcome, or as a mediator of treatment effects. In the event of a slip, highly self-efficacious persons are inclined to regard the slip as a temporary setback and to reinstate control, whereas those who have low self-efficacy are more likely to proceed to a full-blown relapse. This study was carried out to determine relationship between relapse and self-efficacy and other factors in injected drug users.We conducted this study in 200 addicts in the center of counseling behavioral disease in health center of sari city (methadone maintenance therapy center or MMTC). A cross-sectional study was carried out on all of these addicts.The average age in addictions was 38 and its range was 20-60.72%of them were married and the first drug used was opium. All of them had relapse at least one time .we found a relationship between relapse and self-efficacy as well as the relationship between self-efficacy with the age of the first of drug use, dose, and procrastination for treatment, marriage, employment and job was significant.This study found that there was a significant difference between relapse and self-efficacy as well as other related factors. It is important to include drug users and common society organizations representing them in every stage of the governmental policy and program development process to make them responsive to the needs of the community.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762356","annotations":[{"name":"Methadone","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Opium","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.661254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.606453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.513105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Opioid replacement therapy","weight":0.512701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.349716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.254482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Procrastination","weight":0.236089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Belief","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief"},{"name":"Methadone maintenance","weight":0.131078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone_maintenance"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Community health center","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health_center"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Sari","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari"},{"name":"Computer programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"}]}
