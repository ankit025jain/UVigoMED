{"id":43481,"title":"[Perioperative complications and recent results of Frey procedure in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis].","abstract":"To analyze the perioperative complications and recent results of the Frey procedure in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis.Between February 2009 and September 2012, 104 patients with chronic pancreatitis underwent the Frey procedures. This study included 91 male and 13 female patients, with a mean age of (49 ± 11) years (range, 16 to 75 years). The most common symptoms were abdominal pain in 97 patients, diarrhea in 10 patients, obstructive jaundice in 5 patients, and 5 patients had no symptoms. Nine patients had history of pancreatic surgery.There was no mortality. Perioperative complications occurred in 25 patients (24.0%), included pancreatic fistula in 7 patients, delayed gastric emptying in 15 patients, bleeding in 2 patients, abdominal infection in 1 patient, pulmonary infection in 2 patients, delayed healing incision in 4 patients, and pancreatic pseudocyst in 1 patient with reoperation. Seventeen patients with preoperative hyperamylasemia had a higher risk of intranperative hemorrhea and perioperative complications rates. At a mean follow-up of (29 ± 13) months, 8 patients had missed, 2 patients had died, and 3 patients was proved to be coexisted with pancreatic carcinoma. Among 87 patients with abdominal pain, 58 patients (66.7%) have complete pain relief and 23 patients (26.4%) have substantial pain relief. However, among 5 patients without abdominal pain, 2 had recurrent abdominal pain now. Seven of 17 patients with diabetes mellitus aggravated, and new onset of diabetes mellitus was observed in 10 patients. In addition, impaired glucose tolerance was developed in 13 patients. Among 10 patients with diarrhea, the symptom of 4 patients got worse. Thirty-one patients (33.7%) newly developed exocrine insufficiency, included 12 patients treated by patients oral administration of pancreatin and 19 patients only treated by diet control. Ten patients was readmitted and 5 patients underwent reoperation, included 1 patient of pancreatic pseudocyst, 3 patients of chronic pancratitis coexisted with pancreatic carcinoma, and 1 patient of chronic pancratitis with abdominal pain and obstructive jaundice.Frey procedure in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis is a safe technique with low mortality and morbidity rates, but indication should be strictly controlled and pancreatic tumorigenesis should be alerted.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System
