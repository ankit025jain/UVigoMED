{"id":19168,"title":"[Disinfectology as molecular-epidemiologic direction of infection control].","abstract":"Specific aims of environment biologic pathogen control by applying special disinfectologic means and technologies are formulated. The main components of disinfectologic process are examined: molecular-biologic properties of targets--their sensitivity (resistance) to biocidal agents; biocidal molecular-chemical properties of disinfection means; toxicological properties of the latter by their effect on human organism as the object of epidemiologic protection. Perspectives of improvement of disinfectologic technologies by using composition potential of different actively operating molecular substances are discussed.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738297","annotations":[{"name":"Biology","weight":0.898005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.615544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.54,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Biocide","weight":0.13283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocide"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"}]}
