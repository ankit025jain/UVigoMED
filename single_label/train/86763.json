{"id":86763,"title":"MicroRNAs-role in lung cancer.","abstract":"Regulation of gene expression is essential for normal physiological functions; thus deregulation of gene expression is common in disease conditions. One level of regulation of gene expression is performed by noncoding RNAs, among which microRNAs (miRNA) are the best studied. Abnormal expression of these molecular players can lead to pathogenic processes such as heart disease, immune system abnormalities, and carcinogenesis, to name but a few. Of a length of 18-25 nucleotides miRNAs are involved in binding partial complementary sequences within the 3'-UTR (3'-untranslated region) of the target mRNAs. Depending on the type of neoplastic transformation, miRNAs can act both as oncogenes (oncomirs) or as tumor suppressors. Because of the great importance of miRNAs, most researches focus on either their role as biomarkers or their potential as therapeutic targets. Herein, we present the review of microRNA biology, function, and tumorigenic potential with emphasis on their role in lung cancer.
