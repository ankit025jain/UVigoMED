{"id":18518,"title":"Cellular and humoral immune responses during tuberculosis infection: useful knowledge in the era of biological agents.","abstract":"In this review, recent insights into innate and adaptive cellular and humoral immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are discussed and the role of specific cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) is highlighted. According to recent findings, the immune system plays a key role in avoiding mycobacteria dissemination. The importance of different cell types (macrophages, dendritic cells, interferon-?-producing T cells) as well as the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-12, and IL-23/IL-17 have been demonstrated. Alveolar macrophages are considered the first cells infected by Mtb during respiratory infection. Mtb proliferates within alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells and induces the release of cytokines such as TNF-?, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12. Toll-like receptors-stimulated dendritic cells link innate and adaptive immunity by promoting polarization of effector T cells. The efficient induction of Th1 immunity is decisive in defense against Mtb. In fact, host effector immune response against Mtb is related to the presence of a Th1 response. The definition of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the immune response to Mtb can be helpful in developing new preventive strategies to avoid infection relapse, particularly in patients treated with biological agents.
