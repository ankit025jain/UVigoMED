{"id":12040,"title":"Early changes in cytokine expression in peste des petits ruminants disease.","abstract":"Peste des petits ruminants is a viral disease of sheep and goats that has spread through most of Africa as well as the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. Although, the spread of the disease and its economic impact has made it a focus of international concern, relatively little is known about the nature of the disease itself. We have studied the early stages of pathogenesis in goats infected with six different isolates of Peste des petits ruminants virus representing all four known lineages of the virus. No lineage-specific difference in the pathogenicity of the virus isolates was observed, although there was evidence that even small numbers of cell culture passages could affect the degree of pathogenicity of an isolate. A consistent reduction in CD4+ T cells was observed at 4 days post infection (dpi). Measurement of the expression of various cytokines showed elements of a classic inflammatory response but also a relatively early induction of interleukin 10, which may be contributing to the observed disease.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559207","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.822455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.768876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Goat","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.667249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Middle East","weight":0.648575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.571845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.527551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Ruminant","weight":0.506654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.449135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Bubonic plague","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Pathogenicity","weight":0.249069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenicity"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.242892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.17956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.165412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0554503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Ovine rinderpest","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovine_rinderpest"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
