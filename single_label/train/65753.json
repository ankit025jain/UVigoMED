{"id":65753,"title":"Satellite hemodialysis services for patients with end stage renal disease.","abstract":"More than 40,000 Canadians are living with end stage renal disease and approximately 22,400 of those are currently being treated with hemodialysis (The Kidney Foundation of Canada, 2013). Long distance travel to access hemodialysis services can be a serious burden for patients, and travelling more than 60 minutes can mean a 20% greater risk for death, as compared with those who travel 15 minutes or less (Moist et al., 2008). Satellite hemodialysis units are seen as one solution to this problem. This study assessed the impact of services provided by one satellite hemodialysis unit on patients' satisfaction, access to care and quality of life using a qualitative interview research design. Seven patients were interviewed and three themes emerged including the burden of long distance travel before satellite services (safety, time and cost), satisfaction with satellite services (pleasant environment and continuity of care), and improved quality of life. This study showed that a satellite hemodialysis unit improved access to services and enhanced the quality of life of those patients who participated in the study.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783770","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.670267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.62554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Satellite","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.113728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Travel","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel"},{"name":"Continuity (fiction)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_(fiction)"},{"name":"Design of experiments","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments"},{"name":"60 Minutes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Long-distance track event","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-distance_track_event"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Seven Network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Network"},{"name":"Constitution Act, 1867","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1867"},{"name":"Long-distance calling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-distance_calling"},{"name":"National Kidney Foundation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Kidney_Foundation"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.0152908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Moist (Canadian band)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moist_(Canadian_band)"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"},{"name":"Continuity of Care Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_Care_Document"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
