{"id":81846,"title":"Effect of high-fructose corn syrup on Streptococcus mutans virulence gene expression and on tooth demineralization.","abstract":"High-fructose corn syrup-55 (HFCS-55) has been widely welcomed in recent years as a substitute for sucrose on the basis of its favourable properties and price. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of HFCS-55 on the expression of Streptococcus mutans UA159 virulence genes and on tooth demineralization. Real-time reverse-transcription PCR (real-time RT-PCR) and microhardness evaluations were performed to examine gene expression and enamel demineralization, respectively, after treatment with HFCS-55 and/or sucrose. Significant up-regulation of glucosyltransferase B (gtfB) by HFCS-55 was found. A mixture of HFCS-55 and sucrose could positively enhance expression of glucan-binding protein (gbp) genes. Regarding acidogenicity, expression of the lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) gene was unaffected by HFCS-55. A notable finding in this study was that 5% HFCS-55 significantly enhanced expression of the intracellular response gene of the two-component VicRK signal transduction system (vicR). Demineralization testing showed that the microhardness of teeth decreased by a greater extent in response to HFCS-55 than in response to sucrose. The results indicate that HFCS-55 can enhance S. mutans biofilm formation indirectly in the presence of sucrose and that HFCS-55 has a more acidogenic potential than does sucrose. Summing up the real-time PCR and demineralization results, HFCS-55 appears to be no less cariogenic than sucrose in vitro - at least, not under the conditions of our experiments.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24813075","annotations":[{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Sucrose","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.815511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.769472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.747118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.739356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.568532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Maize","weight":0.535661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize"},{"name":"Streptococcus mutans","weight":0.455374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_mutans"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.431731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.245517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Syrup","weight":0.231059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrup"},{"name":"High-fructose corn syrup","weight":0.128662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-fructose_corn_syrup"},{"name":"Corn syrup","weight":0.0707274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_syrup"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glucosyltransferase","weight":0.0358207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucosyltransferase"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Substitute (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Price","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price"},{"name":"Acidogenesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidogenesis"},{"name":"Summing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summing"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"}]}
