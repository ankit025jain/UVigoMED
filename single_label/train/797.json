{"id":797,"title":"Meningococcal B vaccine. An immunogenic vaccine possibly useful during outbreaks.","abstract":"Invasive meningococcal infections can be life-threatening and cause severe sequelae. Antibiotic therapy is only partially effective. Bexsero is the first meningococcal B vaccine to be approved in the European Union. It contains four capsular antigens from various strains of group B meningococci. Clinical trials of this meningococcal B vaccine did not assess clinical protection. Two immunogenicity studies in adults, one in adolescents and six in infants, are available. They established the immunogenicity of the meningococcal B vaccine, determined age-appropriate vaccination schedules, and verified that concomitant administration of other vaccines did not undermine its immunogenicity. In the absence of relevant clinical trials, an in vitro study showed that sera from vaccinated individuals were likely to have bactericidal activity against 85% of 200 invasive meningococcal B strains isolated in France in 2007-2008. The meningococcal B vaccine provoked local adverse effects in most vaccinees, including local erythema, induration and pain. Fever occurred in about half of vaccinated children. Six cases of Kawasaki syndrome have been reported in children who received the vaccine, compared to only one case in control groups. In practice, the harm-benefit balance of this meningococcal B vaccine justify using it during outbreaks, provided the outbreak strain is covered by the vaccine antigens. Vaccinees should be enrolled in studies designed to evaluate clinical efficacy and to better determine the risk of Kawasaki syndrome.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25325113","annotations":[{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Bactericide","weight":0.785924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactericide"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.72437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.723181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Meningococcal disease","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningococcal_disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.613936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Neisseria meningitidis","weight":0.374485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria_meningitidis"},{"name":"France","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Kawasaki disease","weight":0.209824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_disease"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"}]}
