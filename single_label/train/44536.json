{"id":44536,"title":"A new sampling method for spleen stiffness measurement based on quantitative acoustic radiation force impulse elastography for noninvasive assessment of esophageal varices in newly diagnosed HCV-related cirrhosis.","abstract":"In our study, we evaluated the feasibility of a new sampling method for splenic stiffness (SS) measurement by Quantitative Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Elastography (Virtual Touch Tissue Quantification (VTTQ)).We measured SS in 54 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis of whom 28 with esophageal varices (EV), 27 with Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) F1-F3, and 63 healthy controls. VTTQ-SS was significantly higher among cirrhotic patients with EV (3.37?m/s) in comparison with controls (2.19?m/s, P<0.001), CHC patients (2.37?m/s, P<0.001), and cirrhotic patients without EV (2.7?m/s, P<0.001). Moreover, VTTQ-SS was significantly higher among cirrhotic patients without EV in comparison with both controls (P<0.001) and CHC patients (P<0.01). The optimal VTTQ-SS cut-off value for predicting EV was 3.1?m/s (AUROC=0.96, sensitivity 96.4%, specificity 88.5%, positive predictive value 90%, negative predictive value 96%, positive likelihood ratio 8.36, and negative likelihood ratio 0.04). In conclusion, VTTQ-SS is a promising noninvasive and reliable diagnostic tool to screen cirrhotic patients for EV and reduce the need for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. By using our cut-off value of 3.1?m/s, we would avoid endoscopy in around 45% of cirrhotic subjects, with significant time and cost savings.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System
