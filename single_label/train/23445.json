{"id":23445,"title":"Effectiveness of infection prevention measures featuring advanced source control and environmental cleaning to limit transmission of extremely-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in a Thai intensive care unit: An analysis before and after extensive flo","abstract":"Advanced source control (once-daily bathing and 4-times daily oral care with chlorhexidine aqueous solution) and thorough environmental cleaning were implemented in response to an increased incidence of colonization and infection with extremely drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii in a Thai medical intensive care unit (MICU).During the 12-month baseline period (P1), contact isolation, active surveillance for XDR A baumannii, cohorting of XDR A baumannii patients, twice-daily environmental cleaning with detergent-disinfectant, and antibiotic stewardship were implemented. In the 5.5-month intervention period (P2), additional measures were introduced. Sodium hypochlorite was substituted for detergent-disinfectant, and advanced source control was implemented. All interventions except cleaning with sodium hypochlorite were continued during the 12.5-month follow-up period (P3). Extensive flooding necessitating closure of the hospital for 2 months occurred between P2 and P3.A total of 1,365 patients were studied. Compared with P1 (11.1 cases/1,000 patient-days), the rate of XDR A baumannii clinical isolates declined in P2 (1.74 cases/1,000 patient-days; P < .001) and further in P3 (0.69 cases/1,000 patient-days; P < .001). Compared with P1 (12.15 cases/1,000 patient-days), the rate of XDR A baumannii surveillance isolates also declined in P2 (2.11 cases/1,000 patient-days; P < .001) and P3 (0.98 cases/1,000 patient-days; P < .001). Incidence of nosocomial infections remained stable. Six patients developed chlorhexidine-induced rash (1.4/1,000 patient-days); 31 patients developed mucositis (17.1/1,000 patient-days).These results support advanced source control and thorough environmental cleaning to limit colonization and infection with XDR A baumannii in MICUs in resource-limited settings.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485368","annotations":[{"name":"Chlorhexidine","weight":0.861098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Sodium hypochlorite","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hypochlorite"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.621832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.548236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.322517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.266338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.238843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.134165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acinetobacter baumannii","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter_baumannii"},{"name":"Hypochlorite","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochlorite"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Flood","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood"},{"name":"Bathing","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Revision control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control"},{"name":"Mucositis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucositis"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Stewardship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Oral medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_medicine"},{"name":"Substitution reaction","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_reaction"},{"name":"Biosafety level","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Environmentalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"}]}
