{"id":3941,"title":"Automated detection of new or evolving melanocytic lesions using a 3D body model.","abstract":"Detection of new or rapidly evolving melanocytic lesions is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment of melanoma. We propose a fully automated pre-screening system for detecting new lesions or changes in existing ones, on the order of 2 - 3mm, over almost the entire body surface. Our solution is based on a multi-camera 3D stereo system. The system captures 3D textured scans of a subject at different times and then brings these scans into correspondence by aligning them with a learned, parametric, non-rigid 3D body model. This means that captured skin textures are in accurate alignment across scans, facilitating the detection of new or changing lesions. The integration of lesion segmentation with a deformable 3D body model is a key contribution that makes our approach robust to changes in illumination and subject pose.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25333167","annotations":[{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.365768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.365295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.358263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.324639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.282569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.125439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Melanocyte","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte"},{"name":"Stereophonic sound","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lighting","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighting"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Texture mapping","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping"},{"name":"Deformation (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Segmentation (image processing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(image_processing)"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Detection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
