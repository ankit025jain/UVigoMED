{"id":33483,"title":"Cerebral blood flow velocity and neurodevelopmental outcome in infants undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease.","abstract":"Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) measured by transcranial Doppler sonography has provided information on cerebral perfusion in patients undergoing infant heart surgery, but no studies have reported a relationship to early postoperative and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.CBFV was measured in infants undergoing biventricular repair without aortic arch reconstruction as part of a trial of hemodilution during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB); CBFV (Vm, mean; Vs, systolic; Vd, end-diastolic) in the middle cerebral artery and change in Vm (rVm) were measured intraoperatively and up to 18 hours post-CPB. Neurodevelopmental outcomes, measured at 1 year of age, included the psychomotor development index (PDI) and mental development index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II.CBFV was measured in 100 infants; 43 with D-transposition of the great arteries, 36 with tetralogy of Fallot, and 21 with ventricular septal defects. Lower Vm, Vs, Vd, and rVm at 18 hours post-CPB were independently related to longer intensive care unit duration of stay (p<0.05). In the 85 patients who returned for neurodevelopmental testing, lower Vm, Vs, Vd, and rVm at 18 hours post-CPB were independently associated with lower PDI (p<0.05) and MDI (p<0.05, except Vs: p=0.06) scores. Higher Vs and rVm at 18 hours post-CPB were independently associated with increased incidence of brain injury on magnetic resonance imaging in 39 patients.Postoperative CBFV after biventricular repair is related to early postoperative and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 1 year of age, possibly indicating that low CBFV is a marker of suboptimal postoperative hemodynamics and cerebral perfusion.","date":"2014-07-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
