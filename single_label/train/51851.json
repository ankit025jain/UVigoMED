{"id":51851,"title":"Phenotypic spectrum and hormonal profile in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.","abstract":"Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is characterized by inappropriately low serum concentration of LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulated hormone) in the setting of hypogonadism. A number of pathologic processes cause Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism but it can also occur as a part of various congenital syndromes. Objectives. To characterize the morphotypes and the hormonal profile of the HH patients enrolled in the COST Action BM1105 within \"C.I. Parhon\" National Institute of Endocrinology from May 2012 onward. Methods. The eligible patients were selected by using a general protocol that included: a detailed familial and personal history; a clinical evaluation focusing on genital development; a hormonal evaluation that aimed to exclude the acquired causes of HH and to characterize the basal/stimulated (triptoreline) profile of gonadotropins; a DNA extraction for genetic studies.We examinated the medical records of patients admitted in our institute with the diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism from May 2012 onward. There were 19 patients: 12 males and 7 females, age at diagnosis 28.03 Â± 11.45 years (13.4-56 years). The phenotypic expressions were variable and the hormonal evaluation showed low values of basal and stimulated gonadotropins.Although hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a rare disease, the monospeciality profile of National Institute of Endocrinology enable the enrolment of a high number of patients in order to create clinical guidelines for evaluation/diagnosis and for treating GnRH deficient patients.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24653756","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.844331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.793433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.793129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.713328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.711904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.710857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.526688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.521206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","weight":0.476583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.458458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.457728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Bachelor's degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Spectrum (psychiatry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(psychiatry)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Institute","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0137282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
