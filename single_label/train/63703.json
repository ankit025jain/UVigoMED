{"id":63703,"title":"Dendritic cells loaded with myeloma cells pretreated with a combination of JSI-124 and bortezomib generate potent myeloma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro.","abstract":"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is highly activated in multiple myeloma. Activated STAT3 promotes survival and proliferation of cancer cells, suppresses Th1 immune response, and induces dysfunction of immune cells. We investigated whether pretreating myeloma cells with a phosphor (p)-STAT3 inhibitor (JSI-124) and/or bortezomib before loading into dendritic cells (DCs) can affect DC function. The combination treatment with JSI-124 and bortezomib resulted in the highest expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 90 and the lowest expression of p-STAT3 in dying myeloma cells. DCs loaded with dying myeloma cells treated by JSI-124 and bortezomib produced the least amount of p-STAT3 compared to other treatments. The DCs were recovered from abnormal cytokine secretions of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, and IL-23 without any effect on production of IL-12p70. DCs loaded with JSI-124 and bortezomib treated, dying myeloma cells most potently generated myeloma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The data suggest that pretreatment of myeloma cells with JSI-124 and bortezomib can recover DC function through the up-regulation of HSP90 and the down-regulation of p-STAT3 and inhibitory cytokines, and that these DCs can potently generate myeloma-specific CTLs.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24407159","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.914388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Heat shock protein","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shock_protein"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Bortezomib","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortezomib"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Hsp90","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsp90"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.798363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.751524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.709756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.407291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.340674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.337193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.311587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.252293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Heat shock","weight":0.243667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shock"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"}]}
