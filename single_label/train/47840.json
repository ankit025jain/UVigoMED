{"id":47840,"title":"Comparison of open, laparoscopic, and hand-assisted laparoscopic devascularization of the upper stomach and splenectomy for treatment of esophageal and gastric varices: a single-center experience.","abstract":"Laparoscopic devascularization of the upper stomach and splenectomy (Dev+Sp), is technically difficult in patients with portal hypertension because of enlarged collateral vessels and spleen. This report presents the efficacy and safety of hand-assisted laparoscopic (HALS) Dev+Sp.Ten patients underwent HALS Dev+Sp as a treatment for esophagogastric varices between 2005 and 2012 (HALS group). A vessel-sealing system was used for devascularization of vessels. An autosuture device was applied to dissect the splenic hilum and the left gastric and enlarged short gastric vessels. The operative and postoperative data were compared between patients who previously underwent laparoscopic Dev+Sp (LAP group, n?=?9) and conventional Dev+Sp (OP group, n?=?10) between 2001 and 2008.The mean operative time was 328, 336, and 245?min (P?<?0.05) and the mean blood loss was 1786, 981, and 250?mL (P?<?0.05) in the OP, LAP, and HALS groups, respectively. Laparoscopic surgery was converted to HALS in one patient and to open surgery in three patients. There were no conversions in the HALS group. There was no significant difference in the cumulative recurrence rate and bleeding rate in the groups.HALS Dev+Sp is a feasible and effective surgery in patients with portal hypertension.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24571442","annotations":[{"name":"Portal hypertension","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_hypertension"},{"name":"Splenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenectomy"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Esophageal varices","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_varices"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.679314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Gastric varices","weight":0.427867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_varices"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.306686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.127027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Hilum of lung","weight":0.0828226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilum_of_lung"},{"name":"Varices","weight":0.0773772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varices"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Gastrosplenic ligament","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrosplenic_ligament"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Dominican Order","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"1786","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1786"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Short gastric veins","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_gastric_veins"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Collateral (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)"},{"name":"Left gastric artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_gastric_artery"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
