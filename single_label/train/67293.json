{"id":67293,"title":"False hyperlactatemia in life-threatening ethylene glycol poisoning.","abstract":"Ethylene glycol poisoning is rare, but prompt diagnosis is crucial, in order to initiate specific treatments. Herein, we report the case of a patient who was admitted to ICU for coma and extreme metabolic acidosis with unexpected hyperlactatemia on initial ICU blood gas analyzer. Ethylene glycol poisoning was diagnosed, and hyperlactatemia was ruled out on a blood sample sent to the biochemistry department. Interference of blood gas analyzers lactate electrodes with metabolites of ethylene glycol were the source of this apparent hyperlactatemia. Symptoms gradually improved and false hyperlactatemia resolved after renal replacement therapy and fomepizole administration. Time course of ethylene glycol concentration showed similar evolution. After initial confirmation of ethylene glycol presence, this biological interference could thus be used as a surrogate of costly and highly specialised dosages.
