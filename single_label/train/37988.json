{"id":37988,"title":"Elevated serum IgE against MGL_1304 in patients with atopic dermatitis and cholinergic urticaria.","abstract":"MGL_1304 secreted by Malassezia globosa is contained in human sweat and induces histamine release from basophils in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) at a high positive rate. The aims of this study were to establish the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measuring specific immunoglobulins against MGL_1304 and to investigate the levels of these immunoglobulins in sera of patients with various allergic diseases.Purified MGL_1304 from human sweat (QRX) and recombinant MGL_1304 (rMGL_1304) were prepared for ELISA. To quantify the amount of MGL_1304-specific immunoglobulins, the standard serum was created by pooling sera of 20 patients with AD whose basophils released histamine in response to QRX. A monoclonal antibody which exhibited the highest neutralizing ability against QRX was established as Smith-2, and used as a capture antibody for the assay of QRX-specific IgE. A total of 156 subjects [normal controls (n = 23), AD (n = 63), cholinergic urticaria (CU) (n = 24), bronchial asthma (n = 32), and allergic rhinitis (n = 14)] were enrolled in this study.ELISA methods to quantify the specific IgE, IgG and IgG4 against MGL_1304 in sera were successfully established. Levels of QRX-specific IgE in sera of patients with AD and CU were significantly higher than those of normal controls. Moreover, the levels of QRX-specific IgE and rMGL_1304-specific IgE in patients with AD were significantly correlated with their disease severities.These ELISA methods to quantify the specific immunoglobulins against MGL_1304 are easy and useful means to assess allergy to MGL_1304. MGL_1304 contained in sweat is an important antigen for patients with AD and CU.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457815","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Urticaria","weight":0.84873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticaria"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.820887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Histamine","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.798264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Basophil granulocyte","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Cholinergic","weight":0.781434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic"},{"name":"Perspiration","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Cholinergic urticaria","weight":0.554241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic_urticaria"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.551911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.521646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Malassezia","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malassezia"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Neutralizing antibody","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody"}]}
