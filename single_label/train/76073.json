{"id":76073,"title":"School-sponsored before, after, and extended school year programs--the role of the school nurse: position statement.","abstract":"It is the position of the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) that the registered professional school nurse (hereinafter referred to as school nurse) has the educational and clinical background to coordinate the necessary school health services to provide students with the same health, nutrition, and safety needs while attending school-sponsored before, after, and extended school year programs as the students receive during the traditional school day/year. In 2010, the White House Task Force on Obesity called for an increase in access to safe supervised physical activities beyond the school day (White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity Report to the President, 2010), and as these programs have expanded, the necessity for providing quality, effective health care services during these hours has developed. As the expert in school health services delivery models of health care, the school nurse is an essential facilitator for student access to these programs. The school nurse plays a vital role in preparing the school-sponsored before and after school and extended school year program personnel with the necessary resources to respond to a health emergency.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272415","annotations":[{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.810373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.68449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"White House","weight":0.657565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"},{"name":"School","weight":0.566196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.482994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Childhood obesity","weight":0.466214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_obesity"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.378818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"School health services","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_health_services"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"President of the United States","weight":0.215432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Academic term","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_term"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"School nursing","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_nursing"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Task force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_force"},{"name":"School nurse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_nurse"},{"name":"Professional school","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_school"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Voter registration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration"}]}
