{"id":50968,"title":"Efficacy and safety of lobeglitazone monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus over 24-weeks: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo controlled trial.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the glucose-lowering and lipid-modifying effects, and safety profile of lobeglitazone, a novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- ? agonist, compared to placebo as a monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes.At 24 weeks, a significant reduction in HbA1c was observed with lobeglitazone versus placebo (-0.44% vs 0.16%, mean difference -0.6%, p<0.0001). The goal of HbA1c <7% was achieved significantly more in the lobeglitazone group compared to the placebo group (44% vs 12%, p<0.0001). Markers of insulin resistance were also improved in the lobeglitazone group. In addition, lobeglitazone treatment significantly improved triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, small dense low density lipoprotein cholesterol, free fatty acid, and apolipoprotein-B/CIII compared to placebo (p<0.01, respectively). More weight gain was observed in the lobeglitazone group than the placebo group (0.89 kg vs - 0.63 kg, mean difference 1.52 kg, p<0.0001). The safety profile was comparable between the two groups and lobeglitazone was well tolerated.Lobeglitazone 0.5 mg showed a favorable balance in the efficacy and safety profile. The results support a potential role of lobeglitazone in treating type 2 diabetes.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736628","annotations":[{"name":"Free fatty acid","weight":0.893781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_fatty_acid"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Peroxisome","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.866133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.588645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.577197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.310706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.301155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.2165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"}]}
