{"id":1042,"title":"Hierarchical multiple-model Bayesian approach to transmural electrophysiological imaging.","abstract":"Noninvasive electrophysiological (EP) imaging of the heart aims to mathematically reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of cardiac current sources from body-surface electrocardiographic (ECG) data. This ill-posed problem is often regularized by a fixed constraining model. However, this approach enforces the source distribution to follow a preassumed spatial structure that does not always match the varying spatiotemporal distribution of current sources. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian approach to transmural EP imaging that employs a continuous combination of multiple models, each reflecting a specific spatial property for current sources. Multiple models are incorporated as an Lp-norm prior for current sources, where p is an unknown hyperparameter with a prior probabilistic distribution. The current source estimation is obtained as an optimally weighted combination of solutions across all models, the weight being determined from the posterior distribution of p inferred from ECG data. The accuracy of our approach is assessed in a set of synthetic and real-data experiments on human heart-torso models. While the use of fixed models (L1- and L2-norm) only properly recovers sources with specific structures, our method delivers consistent performance in reconstructing sources with various extents and structures.","date":"2014-12-08","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485421","annotations":[{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"Bayesian probability","weight":0.750663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Posterior probability","weight":0.696082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.541871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.419468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Hyperparameter","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.329746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.215692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Spacetime","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Hierarchy","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy"},{"name":"Consistent estimator","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Property","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Extended play","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Norm (mathematics)","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Tikhonov regularization","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"First language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_language"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Extent (file systems)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extent_(file_systems)"},{"name":"Synthetic proposition","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_proposition"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Current source","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_source"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Spatial ecology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_ecology"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
