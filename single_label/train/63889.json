{"id":63889,"title":"Detection and quantification of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts by droplet digital PCR.","abstract":"Monitoring BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts by real-time quantitative RT-PCR has become an important clinical test for the management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. However, it has some inherent limitations with regard to its lower limit of detection and limit of quantification. Improvement in the lower limit of detection could aid clinicians in selecting candidates for discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors without relapse. Improvement in the limit of quantification may also avoid unnecessary testing or changes in therapy. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of droplet digital RT-PCR with regard to simplicity, lower limit of detection, and limit of quantification. We expect the advantages of droplet digital RT-PCR will make it the preferred method for quantification of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts.
