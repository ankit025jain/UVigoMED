{"id":10783,"title":"Production of equine herpesvirus 1 recombinant glycoprotein D and development of an agar gel immunodiffusion test for serological diagnosis.","abstract":"Equine herpesvirus 1 and 4 (EHV-1 and 4) infect most of the world's horses, causing serious clinical illness. Viral glycoproteins have been identified as the immunodominant antigens that generate the antiviral serological responses to EHV-1 and EHV-4 in infected horses. Here, glycoprotein D of EHV-1 was expressed by a recombinant baculovirus, purified and evaluated by a simple agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGID). Compared with virus neutralization, serological analysis by AGID showed good specificity (100%) and sensitivity (99.5%). The estimated Kappa values for repeatability and reproducibility were satisfactory. Thus, this rapid, inexpensive, simple and highly specific AGID test seems to be a valuable alternative tool for serological detection of antibodies against both EHV-1 and EHV-4.
