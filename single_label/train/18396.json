{"id":18396,"title":"[Central nervous system infection presenting with cognitive impairment].","abstract":"In diabetes mellitus, various complications are caused by microvascular damage caused by a long-term hyperglycosemic state. In diabetes mellitus, the prevalence of the infectious disease is high and is easy to become severe. And, central nervous system infection is one of the most important causes of cognitive impairment. We want to show about some important central nervous system infections which affect to cognitive functions.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796107","annotations":[{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.227706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.147191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"List of infections of the central nervous system","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_infections_of_the_central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
