{"id":56772,"title":"Management of idiopathic retinal vasoproliferative tumors by slit-lamp laser or endolaser photocoagulation.","abstract":"To report the efficacy of laser photocoagulation in treating idiopathic (primary) retinal vasoproliferative tumors.Retrospective noncomparative interventional case series.Thirty eyes of 30 patients (22 women and 8 men) with retinal vasoproliferative tumors. Main outcome measures were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), presence of retinal hard exudates, retinal detachment (RD), cystoid macular edema (CME), and epiretinal membrane (ERM). Laser photocoagulation was performed at the slit lamp or during pars plana vitrectomy for telangiectasia visible at the retinal vasoproliferative tumors surface.Fifteen eyes were treated with slit-lamp laser. Mean follow-up was 36.5 months (range 7 months to 11 years). Mean BCVA increased from 20/40 to 20/32 at the end of the follow-up. Hard exudates and CME regressed completely in 15 of 15 and 5 of 6 eyes, respectively. Fifteen eyes underwent vitrectomy owing to the presence of ERM (10 eyes), large exudative RD (4 eyes), or vitreous hemorrhage (1 eye). Mean follow-up was 24 months (9 months to 3.5 years). Mean BCVA increased from 20/125 to 20/40 at the end of the follow-up. No vision loss occurred. The retina reattached in all cases. Hard exudates regressed completely in 14 of 15 eyes and decreased significantly in 1. Postoperative complications were rhegmatogenous RD in 2 eyes, successfully reattached after additional surgery.Selective laser photocoagulation of retinal telangiectasia at the retinal vasoproliferative tumors' surface induced the regression of retinal exudation. Slit-lamp laser photocoagulation was sufficient in half of the cases. In more severe conditions, direct endolaser photocoagulation of the telangiectasia was required.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631475","annotations":[{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.908618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.895163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.815511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Slit lamp","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slit_lamp"},{"name":"Epiretinal membrane","weight":0.801676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiretinal_membrane"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.77878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Vision loss","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Pars plana","weight":0.608304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pars_plana"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.579824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.388693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.128014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0474673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Dietitian","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Telangiectasia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangiectasia"}]}
