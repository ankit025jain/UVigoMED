{"id":78291,"title":"Speechreading as a communication mediator.","abstract":"To compare the speechreading between individuals with hearing impairment and with normal hearing levels to verify the factors that influence the speechreading among hearing impaired patients.Forty individuals with severe-to-profound hearing loss aged between 13 and 70 years old (study group) and 21 hearing individuals aged between 17 and 63 years old (control group) were evaluated. As a research instrument, anamnesis was used to characterize the groups; three speechreading instruments, presenting stimuli via a mute video, with a female speaker; and a vocabulary test, to verify their influence on speechreading. A descriptive and analytical statistics (ANOVA test and Pearson's correlation), adopting a significance level of 0.05 (5%).A better performance was observed in the group with hearing impairment in speechreading tests than in the group with hearing individuals. By analyzing the group with hearing loss, there was a mean difference between tests (p<0.001), which also showed correlation between them. Individuals with pre-lingual hearing loss and those who underwent therapy for speechreading had a better performance for most speechreading instruments. The variables gender and schooling showed no influence on speechreading.Individuals with hearing impairment had better performance on speechreading tasks in comparison to people with normal hearing. Furthermore, it was found that the ability to perform speechread might be influenced by the vocabulary, period of installation of the hearing loss, and speechreading therapy.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714859","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.267783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.241348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Vocabulary","weight":0.227496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary"},{"name":"School","weight":0.186716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Lip reading","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_reading"},{"name":"Equal-loudness contour","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Public speaking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking"},{"name":"Installation art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_art"},{"name":"Morleys (department store)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morleys_(department_store)"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Muteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muteness"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Prelingual deafness","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelingual_deafness"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
