{"id":72635,"title":"MRI of breast tumor initiating cells using the extra domain-B of fibronectin targeting nanoparticles.","abstract":"The identification of breast tumor initiating cells (BTICs) is important for the diagnosis and therapy of breast cancers. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether the extra domain-B of fibronectin (EDB-FN) could be used as a new biomarker for BTICs and whether EDB-FN targeting superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) could be used as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent for BTIC imaging in vitro and in vivo. BTICs (NDY-1) exhibited high EDB-FN expression, whereas non-BTICs (MCF-7, BT-474, SUM-225, MDA-MB-231) did not exhibit EDB-FN expression. Furthermore, Cy3.3-labeled EDB-FN specific peptides (APTEDB) showed preferential binding to the targeted NDY-1 cells. To construct an EDB-FN targeted imaging probe, APTEDB was covalently attached to a thermally cross-linked SPION (TCL-SPION) to yield APTEDB-TCL-SPION. In the in vitro MRI of cell phantoms, selective binding of APTEDB-TCL-SPION to NDY-1 cells was evident, but little binding was observed in MCF-7 cells. After the intravenous injection of APTEDB-TCL-SPION into the NDY-1 mouse tumor xenograft model, a significant decrease in the signal within the tumor was observed in the T2*-weighted images; however, there was only a marginal change in the signal of non-targeting SPIONs such as APTscramble-TCL-SPION or TCL-SPION. Taken together, we report for the first time that EDB-FN was abundantly expressed in BTICs and may therefore be useful as a new biomarker for identifying BTICs. Our study also suggests that APTEDB-TCL-SPION could be used as an MRI contrast agent for BTIC imaging.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24955145","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.870187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Iron oxide","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_oxide"},{"name":"Superparamagnetism","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superparamagnetism"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.712801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"MRI contrast agent","weight":0.712568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI_contrast_agent"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.689984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.638158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.62237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Covalent bond","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.614026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.571808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.49426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Fibronectin","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibronectin"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.299804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.245686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.167499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"MCF-7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
