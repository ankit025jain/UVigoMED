{"id":53313,"title":"Paediatric pituitary adenomas: a decade of change.","abstract":"Pituitary adenomas, although rare in the paediatric age range and mostly benign, represent very challenging disorders for diagnosis and management. The recent identification of genetic alterations in young individuals with pituitary adenomas has broadened the scope of molecular investigations and contributed to the understanding of mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Recent identification of causative mutations of genes such as GNAS, PRKAR1A, MEN1 and AIP has introduced the concept of molecular screening of young apparently healthy family members. Population-based studies have reported a significantly higher number of affected subjects and genetic variations than expected. Radiological techniques have advanced, yet many microadenomas remain undetectable on scanning. However, experience with transsphenoidal and endoscopic pituitary surgery has led to higher rates of cure. Prolactinomas, corticotroph and somatotroph adenomas remain the most prevalent, with each diagnosis presenting its own challenges. As paediatric pituitary adenomas occur very infrequently within the paediatric age range, paediatric endocrine units cannot provide expert management in isolation. Consequently, close co-operation with adult endocrinology colleagues with experience of pituitary disease is strongly recommended.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525527","annotations":[{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pituitary adenoma","weight":0.607997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_adenoma"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Prolactinoma","weight":0.514787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactinoma"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.376579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.332234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.323482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.320678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_endocrine_neoplasia"},{"name":"MEN1","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEN1"},{"name":"Somatotropic cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatotropic_cell"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Sphenoid bone","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"}]}
