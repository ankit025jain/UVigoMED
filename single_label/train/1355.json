{"id":1355,"title":"[The seasonality of population contacts with medical organizations because of diseases of blood circulation system].","abstract":"The comprehension of significance of health impacting of such unchangeable factors as climate and atmospheric phenomenons allows carrying out measures to decrease their negative effect on human health. The data of study implemented in Orel in 2009-2012 made it possible to distribute the annual totality of diagnoses registered in medical organizations on the groups of diseases of blood circulation system according ICD-10. The analysis established lower level of visits to physician because of these conditions both in ambulatory polyclinic institutions and hospital during summer period. The corresponding percentage came to 21.9% out of all diagnoses in polyclinic and 22% in hospital at highest levels of 27% in summer period. Therefore, in development of population contacts with medical organizations an expressed seasonality is detected. This occurrence is possibly related to characteristics of development of pathological conditions in different seasons.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25373289","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.840486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Climate","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.646062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Atmosphere","weight":0.538034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Summer","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Polyclinic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyclinic"},{"name":"Oryol","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryol"},{"name":"ICD-10","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Solar eclipse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Seasonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonality"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"}]}
