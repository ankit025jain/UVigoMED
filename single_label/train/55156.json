{"id":55156,"title":"An evaluation of two candidate functional biomarkers for AMD.","abstract":"To evaluate the intersession repeatability of the Colour Assessment and Diagnosis (CAD) test and a novel 14-Hz flicker test in a population of healthy participants to provide benchmark data for their use as functional biomarkers for age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Visual function was assessed using both techniques in 30 healthy adults (mean [standard deviation] age 36.3 [14.1] years) on two separate days. Intersession repeatability of RG and YB CAD thresholds and 14-Hz flicker thresholds was assessed by determining their coefficient of repeatability (CoR).The CoR was calculated to be 0.39 CAD units (17.0%) for RG thresholds, 0.43 CAD units (31.1%) for YB thresholds, and 0.015 (53.4%) for 14-Hz flicker contrast thresholds. On average, thresholds improved by 4.72% (RG), 6.33% (YB), and 13.3% (14-Hz flicker) between visits 1 and 2, suggesting a small but consistent learning effect. The CoR for all parameters was relatively small compared to the mean thresholds obtained (RG: mean 2.27 [4.58], CoR 0.39; YB: mean 1.37 [0.55], CoR 0.43; 14-Hz flicker: mean 0.028 [0.01], CoR 0.015).This study has described the repeatability of the CAD and 14-Hz flicker tests. These data can help clinicians decide if the results from repeated measures are of clinical significance. Despite pretest training, there was some evidence of a learning effect. Therefore, clinical trials using these techniques should ensure training is sufficient to minimize these effects.","date":"2014-07-26","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24978867","annotations":[{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.696082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.6919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.671548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.281782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.145927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Repeated measures design","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design"},{"name":"Repeatability","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeatability"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Computer-aided design","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Intersession","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersession"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Benchmarking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking"},{"name":"Flicker (screen)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_(screen)"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Consistent estimator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator"},{"name":"Yottabyte","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yottabyte"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Habituation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habituation"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
