{"id":90836,"title":"Personal protective equipment use among students with special health care needs reporting injuries in school-sponsored vocational, career, and technical education programs in New Jersey.","abstract":"Students with special health care needs (SHCNs) and individualized education plans (IEPs) may be injured more often in vocational, career, and technical education (CTE) programs. No research to date considers personal protective equipment (PPE) use among students with SHCNs in school-based programs reporting injuries to agencies. Data from 1999 to 2011 on PPE use among injured students in CTE programs in public schools and private secondary schools for the disabled were analyzed; students with SHCNs were distinguished by IEP status within New Jersey Safe Schools surveilance data. Among students with IEPs using PPE, 36% of injuries occurred to body parts PPE was meant to protect. Likely injury types were cuts-lacerations and burns for students with IEPs using PPE and cuts-lacerations and sprains for students with IEPs not using PPE. Females with IEPs using PPE were injured less often than males across ages. Results suggested students with SHCNs with IEPs need further job-related training with increased emphasis on properly selecting and fitting PPE.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24571050","annotations":[{"name":"Vocational education","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"New Jersey","weight":0.64493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.637455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.541392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.483031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.343165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Vocation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.056379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Personal protective equipment","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Sprain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprain"},{"name":"Thermal expansion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_expansion"},{"name":"Likely, British Columbia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likely,_British_Columbia"},{"name":"Jersey","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey"},{"name":"Individualized Education Program","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualized_Education_Program"}]}
