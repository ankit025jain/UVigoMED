{"id":38656,"title":"Biomarker selection for medical diagnosis using the partial area under the ROC curve.","abstract":"A biomarker is usually used as a diagnostic or assessment tool in medical research. Finding an ideal biomarker is not easy and combining multiple biomarkers provides a promising alternative. Moreover, some biomarkers based on the optimal linear combination do not have enough discriminatory power. As a result, the aim of this study was to find the significant biomarkers based on the optimal linear combination maximizing the pAUC for assessment of the biomarkers.Under the binormality assumption we obtain the optimal linear combination of biomarkers maximizing the partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (pAUC). Related statistical tests are developed for assessment of a biomarker set and of an individual biomarker. Stepwise biomarker selections are introduced to identify those biomarkers of statistical significance.The results of simulation study and three real examples, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy disease, heart disease, and breast tissue example are used to show that our methods are most suitable biomarker selection for the data sets of a moderate number of biomarkers.Our proposed biomarker selection approaches can be used to find the significant biomarkers based on hypothesis testing.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24410929","annotations":[{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.817039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.671062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.569893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.236412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.221984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.189899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Muscular dystrophy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Linear combination","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Electric power","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Idealism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"}]}
