{"id":20782,"title":"[Septic arthritis of undetermined origin in children: a proposal for the assessment and its therapy].","abstract":"Septic arthritis is not a frequent, but quite classical pathology in children. It can be followed by a severe outcome in case of delayed and/or inadequate treatment. The drainage of the infected joint associated with a prompt and adapted antibiotherapy are together the cornerstones of this treatment. The isolation and identification of the causative microorganism is also of the highest importance. Up to now, unfortunately, a large proportion of septic arthritis are treated by antibiotics although all culture remain negative. This paper has two objectives: one is to present the different steps to optimize the assessment and diagnosis; the second, to increase the sensitivity of the pathogen identification. At last, we present our proposal for empirical antibiotherapy.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640302","annotations":[{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.814871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.602154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.571532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.554458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.162222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Forensic identification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_identification"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Up (2009 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
