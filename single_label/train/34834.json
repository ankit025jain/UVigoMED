{"id":34834,"title":"Structural joint damage in gout.","abstract":"This article summarizes the structural damage that is observed in advanced gout and current understanding of the mechanisms by which this damage occurs. Interactions between monosodium urate crystals and cells within the joint are described as well as knowledge gained from imaging studies. Future research directions and potential therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of joint damage in gout are also discussed.
