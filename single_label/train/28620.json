{"id":28620,"title":"Flow cytometric-membrane potential detection of sodium channel active marine toxins: application to ciguatoxins in fish muscle and feasibility of automating saxitoxin detection.","abstract":"Ciguatoxins are potent neurotoxins with a significant public health impact. Cytotoxicity assays have allowed the most sensitive means of detection of ciguatoxin-like activity without reliance on mouse bioassays and have been invaluable in studying outbreaks. An improvement of these cell-based assays is presented here in which rapid flow cytometric detection of ciguatoxins and saxitoxins is demonstrated using fluorescent voltage sensitive dyes. A depolarization response can be detected directly due to ciguatoxin alone; however, an approximate 1000-fold increase in sensitivity is observed in the presence of veratridine. These results demonstrate that flow cytometric assessment of ciguatoxins is possible at levels approaching the trace detection limits of our earlier cytotoxicity assays, however, with a significant reduction in analysis time. Preliminary results are also presented for detection of brevetoxins and for automation and throughput improvements to a previously described method for detecting saxitoxins in shellfish extracts.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830140","annotations":[{"name":"Saxitoxin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxitoxin"},{"name":"Sodium channel","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_channel"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Neurotoxin","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxin"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.706273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Shellfish","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellfish"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Veratridine","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veratridine"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.336368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.31588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Depolarization","weight":0.27492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depolarization"},{"name":"Voltage","weight":0.24874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Ciguatoxin","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciguatoxin"},{"name":"Bioassay","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioassay"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Marine (ocean)","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_(ocean)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Voltage sensitive dye","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_sensitive_dye"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Throughput","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput"},{"name":"Trace (linear algebra)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra)"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Italian general election, 2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_general_election,_2006"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"}]}
