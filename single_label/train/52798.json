{"id":52798,"title":"Diabetes screening after gestational diabetes in England: a quantitative retrospective cohort study.","abstract":"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends postpartum and annual monitoring for diabetes for females who have had a diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).To describe the current state of follow-up after GDM in primary care, in England.A retrospective cohort study in 127 primary care practices. The total population analysed comprised 473 772 females, of whom 2016 had a diagnosis of GDM.Two subgroups of females were analysed using electronic general practice records. In the first group of females (n = 788) the quality of postpartum follow-up was assessed during a 6-month period. The quality of long-term annual follow-up was assessed in a second group of females (n = 718), over a 5-year period. The two outcome measures were blood glucose testing performed within 6 months postpartum (first group) and blood glucose testing performed annually (second group).Postpartum follow-up was performed in 146 (18.5%) females within 6 months of delivery. Annual rates of long-term follow-up stayed consistently around 20% a year. Publication of the Diabetes in Pregnancy NICE guidelines, in 2008, had no effect on long-term screening rates. Substantial regional differences were identified among rates of follow-up.Monitoring of females after GDM is markedly suboptimal despite current recommendations.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24567578","annotations":[{"name":"Gestational diabetes","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.75744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Clinical_Excellence"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.686781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.654701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"National Institutes of Health","weight":0.562484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.326876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.326804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.311293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"England","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus and pregnancy","weight":0.222756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_and_pregnancy"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0628681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"788","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/788"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2016","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Japanese dialects","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_dialects"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Substantial (rapper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_(rapper)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"The National (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(band)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"GNOME Display Manager","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Display_Manager"}]}
