{"id":83257,"title":"[Case-control study on intrasacrospinal muscular approach and posterior midline approach for the treatment of far lateral lumbar disc herniation].","abstract":"To compare the clinical outcomes of intrasacrospinal muscular approach and posterior midline approach in treating far lateral lumbar disc herniation.The clinical data of 32 patients with far lateral lumbar disc herniation underwent transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion from January 2004 to January 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into intrasacrospinal muscular approach group (11 males and 6 females ) and posterior midline approach group (10 males and 5 females). All patients were followed up from 12 to 18 months with an average of 15.3 months. Operative time, blood loss, postoperative draining volume were recorded and pre-and post-operative visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were compared between two groups.Operative time, blood loss, postoperative draining volume in intrasacrospinal muscular approach group was less than that of posterior midline approach group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in VAS at final follow-up between two groups (P > 0.05); and the mean ODI in intrasacrospinal muscular approach group was less than that of posterior midline approach group (P < 0.05).For the treatment of far lateral lumbar disc herniation, intrasacrospinal muscular approach has less injury for paraspinal muscle and more satisfactory clinical outcome and is better method than posterior midline approach.","date":"2015-01-09","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25571655","annotations":[{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.622534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Spinal disc herniation","weight":0.413559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.147671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.140676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Oswestry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswestry"},{"name":"One Day International","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Group 11 element","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_11_element"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analog signal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Group 10 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_10_element"},{"name":"Commissure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
