{"id":26590,"title":"Health promotion overview: evidence-based strategies for occupational health nursing practice.","abstract":"Health promotion practice has evolved over the past four decades in response to the rising rates of chronic disease. The focus of health promotion is attaining wellness by managing modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, diet, or physical activity. Occupational health nurses are often asked to conduct worksite health promotion programs for individuals or groups, yet may be unfamiliar with evidence-based strategies. Occupational health nurses should lead interprofessional groups in designing and implementing worksite health promotion programs. This article introduces occupational health nurses to health promotion concepts and discusses evidence-based theories and planning models that can be easily introduced into practice.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25101931","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.725566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.701318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Health promotion","weight":0.634308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_promotion"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.606186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.560335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.558072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.419468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.374442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.208106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Wellness (alternative medicine)","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellness_(alternative_medicine)"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Nursing practice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_practice"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
