{"id":91128,"title":"[Locked plating with minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis versus intramedullary nailing of distal extra-articular tibial fracture: a retrospective study].","abstract":"To compare the efficacies of minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPPO) and interlocking intramedullary nailing (IMN) in the treatment of extra-articular fractures of distal tibia.Retrospective reviews were conducted for 126 patients with extra-articular distal tibia fractures. Treatment was either MIPPO (n = 61) or IMN (n = 65). The outcomes were assessed by comparing operating duration, time to union, the last follow-up American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and complication rate.The average follow-up period was 23.7 (12-53) months. In the minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis group, there were deep infections (n = 2), superficial infections (n = 5), delayed union (n = 2), malunion (n = 2) and knee joint pain (n = 10) were observed. In addition, the average operating duration (85.9 ± 18.9 min), average time to union (17.3 ± 3.8 weeks) and average AOFAS (83.2 ± 11.9) were analyzed. In the interlocking intramedullary nailing group, there were delayed union (n = 3), malunion (n = 12) and knee joint pain (n = 22). And the average operating duration (83.3 ± 15.7 min), average time to union (16.5 ± 3.1 weeks) and average AOFAS (84.9 ± 12.0) were analyzed. No statistical significance existed in operating duration, time to union and the last follow-up AOFAS between two groups (P > 0.05). However, the rates of malformation and knee joint pain were higher in the intramedullary nail group than those in the plate group. And the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.015, P = 0.025).Both MIPPO and IMN are effective for extra-articular fractures of distal tibia. However, the former has the advantage of lowers rate of malformation and knee joint pain. Therefore a surgeon should consider the degree of injury while managing extra-articular fracture of distal tibia.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548389","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.769543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Intramedullary rod","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramedullary_rod"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.636623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.631653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.564935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.46446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.33462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.181443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Arthralgia","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthralgia"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"1253","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1253"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Al Iraqiya","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Iraqiya"},{"name":"Interlocking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlocking"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Plating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Lower extremity of tibia","weight":0.010864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_tibia"}]}
