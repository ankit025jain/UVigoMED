{"id":81457,"title":"Radiographic bone level changes of implant-supported restorations in edentulous and partially dentate patients: 5-year results.","abstract":"To evaluate and compare crestal bone level changes and peri-implant status of implant-supported reconstructions in edentulous and partially dentate patients after a minimum of 5 years of loading.All patients who received a self-tapping implant with a microstructured surface during the years 2003 and 2004 at the Department of Prosthodontics, University of Bern, were included in this study. The implant restorations comprised fixed and removable prostheses for partially and completely edentulous patients. Radiographs were taken immediately after surgery, at impression making, and 1 and 5 years after loading. Crestal bone level (BIC) was measured from the implant shoulder to the first bone contact, and changes were calculated over time (?BIC). The associations between pocket depth, bleeding on probing (BOP), and ?BIC were assessed.Sixty-one implants were placed in 20 patients (mean age, 62 ± 7 years). At the 5-year follow-up, 19 patients with 58 implants were available. Implant survival was 98.4% (one early failure; one patient died). The average ?BIC between surgery and 5-year follow-up was 1.5 ± 0.9 mm and 1.1 ± 0.6 mm for edentulous and partially dentate patients, respectively. Most bone resorption (50%, 0.7 mm) occurred during the first 3 months (osseointegration) and within the first year of loading (21%, 0.3 mm). Mean annual bone loss during the 5 years of loading was < 0.12 mm. Mean pocket depth was 2.6 ± 0.7 mm. Seventeen percent of the implant sites displayed BOP; the frequency was significantly higher in women. None of the variables were significantly associated with crestal bone loss.Crestal bone loss after 5 years was within the normal range, without a significant difference between edentulous and partially dentate patients. In the short term, this implant system can be used successfully for various prosthetic indications.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25032770","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.534654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.38582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.338413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.284512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Bern","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bern"},{"name":"University of Bern","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bern"},{"name":"Bleeding on probing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_on_probing"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prosthodontics","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthodontics"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Osseointegration","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseointegration"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"1 millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_millimetre"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"Pocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
