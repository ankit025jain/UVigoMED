{"id":69606,"title":"Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease A reviewâ€¦from the past.","abstract":"Although Parkinson's disease (PD) has been classically defined as a motor disorder, a range of non-motor symptoms (NMS) including cognitive, mood, autonomic and sleep disturbances occur with the passage of time. Although it seems that the non-motor aspect of PD is a recent observation, classic authors (James Parkinson, Charcot, Gowers, Oppenheim and Wilson) had described many NMS including pain, fatigue, bladder dysfunction, cognitive decline and delusion. In this review we have collated the classic literature of NMS in PD.
