{"id":74196,"title":"Establishment and analysis of osteosarcoma cell sublines with different metastatic characteristics.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to establish human osteosarcoma MG-63 cell sublines with different metastatic characteristics and provide good experimental models for mechanism study of osteosarcoma metastasis. Six cell sublines were screened and established by using the in vitro cloning technology. In vitro invasion experiments, cellular electrophoretic mobility determinations, cellular proliferation rate determinations, and soft agar clone formation assays were used to compare, analyze, and identify the metastatic characteristics of various cell sublines. The results indicated that the invasion capacity, cellular electrophoretic mobility, cell proliferation, and soft agar clone formation capacity of A2, A3, and A16 sublines were higher than those of A1, A6, and A20 sublines. There was no significant difference in various values determined among A2, A3, and A16, and among A1, A6, and A20 (P?>?0.05), but there were significant differences in various values determined between the former three and the latter three (P?<?0.05). In conclusion, MG-63 cell sublines with different metastatic characteristics can be established by combining several technologies and can contribute to further research on the mechanism of osteosarcoma metastasis.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863941","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.606975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.524397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.478363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.281232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.239606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.206516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.125636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"A6 road (England)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A6_road_(England)"},{"name":"A20 road (England)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A20_road_(England)"},{"name":"A16 road (England)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A16_road_(England)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"MG Cars","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_Cars"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"The Establishment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Establishment"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
