{"id":12204,"title":"The effects of resveratrol on tissue injury, oxidative damage, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in an experimental model of acute pancreatitis.","abstract":"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an acute inflammatory condition that results from the digestion of pancreatic tissue by its own enzymes released from the acinar cells. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol on oxidative damage, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and tissue injury involved with AP induced in a rat model using sodium taurocholate (n?=?60). There were three treatment groups with 20 rats per group. Groups I and II received 3% sodium taurocholate solution, while group III underwent the same surgical procedure yet did not receive sodium taurocholate. In addition, group II received 30 mg/kg resveratrol solution. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h time points following the induction of AP. Blood and pancreatic tissue samples were collected and subjected to biochemical assays, Western blot assays, and histopathologic evaluations. Resveratrol did not reduce trypsin levels and prevent tissue damage. Resveratrol prevented I?B degradation (except for 6 h) and decreased nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B), activator protein-1 (AP-1) (except for 24 h), and levels of TNF-?, IL-6 (except for 24 h), and iNOS in the pancreatic tissue at all time points (P?<?0.05). Serum nitric oxide (NO) levels were reduced as well (P?<?0.05). Thus, we concluded that resveratrol did not reduce trypsin levels and did not prevent tissue injury despite the reduction in oxidative damage and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels detected in this model of AP.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24549589","annotations":[{"name":"Western
