It presents information on that a Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 35-based probiotic is able to reduce the incidence and severity of viral and bacterial infections. The potential of zinc and selenium as immunotropic agents is shown.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772516","annotations":[{"name":"Selenium","weight":0.928254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.828539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.593394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.532061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.413398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Lactobacillus casei","weight":0.390579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_casei"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.300315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Dietary mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_mineral"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
