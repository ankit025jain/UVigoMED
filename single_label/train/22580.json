{"id":22580,"title":"The role of methotrexate in resolving ocular inflammation after specific therapy for presumed latent syphilitic uveitis and presumed tuberculosis-related uveitis.","abstract":"This study was designed to investigate whether the antiinflammatory and antiproliferative activity of oral and intravitreal methotrexate (MTX) suppresses intraocular inflammation in patients with presumed latent syphilitic uveitis and presumed tuberculosis-related uveitis.Interventional prospective study including three cases with presumed latent syphilitic uveitis treated with intravenous penicillin and oral MTX, and two cases with presumed tuberculosis-related uveitis treated with standard antituberculosis therapy and intravitreal MTX injections. Treatment efficacy of all cases was assessed by best-corrected visual acuity, fundus fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography.Four eyes of 3 patients with presumed latent syphilitic uveitis had improved best-corrected visual acuity, suppression of intraocular inflammation, and resolution of cystoid macular edema in 6 months with oral MTX therapy. No recurrence of intraocular inflammation was observed in 6 months to 18 months of follow-up period after cessation of MTX. Two eyes of two patients with presumed tuberculosis-related uveitis showed improved best-corrected visual acuity, suppression of intraocular inflammation, and resolution of cystoid macular edema after intravitreal injections of MTX. No recurrence of intraocular inflammation was observed in 6 months to 8 months of follow-up period after cessation of antituberculous therapy.For the first time in the treatment of presumed latent syphilitic uveitis and presumed tuberculosis-related uveitis, we believe that MTX might have an adjunctive role to suppress intraocular inflammation, reduce uveitic macular edema, and prevent the recurrences of the diseases.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531737","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.903181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.842879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.816621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.778848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Syphilis","weight":0.699676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.58817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.520341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Glasses","weight":0.425476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.225149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.199671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.134423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.0635535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Angular resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"}]}
