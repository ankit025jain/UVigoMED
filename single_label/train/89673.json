{"id":89673,"title":"[Effects of meniscectomy and transplantation of human knee on stress of tibiofemoral articular surface].","abstract":"To investigate the effects of meniscectomy and transplantation repair ot the knee on the stress area and average pressure of the tibiofemoral articular surface so as to provide a reference for the relevant basic and clinical researches.Seven qualified right knee joints from adult men cadavers were selected. Required structure was retained after careful dissection. The pressure-sensitive paper was clipped to the proper size in accordance with the measured size of the tibial platform to reserve. The experiment was divided into 4 groups: normal knee group (group A), knee meniscus injury group (group B), knee meniscectomy group (group C), and knee meniscus transplantation group (group D). A horizontal incision above the meniscus was made in the position of knee joint capsule, and the pressure-sensitive paper was placed into the medial and lateral space of the knee joint, then the proximal tibia and distal femur were fixed stably and finally a universal mechanical machine was used for testing in appropriate environmental conditions (the knee joints were given longitudinal 700 N pressure at 00 extension and 30, 60, 90, and 1200 flexion for continuous 120 seconds) until the full color reaction. The knee models were prepared, and then the universal mechanical machine was used to perform a test according to the method stated above respectively. The pressure-sensitive paper was removed, and the color negative films were separated and marked. Colorful image analysis system was used to calculate and analyze the stress area and average pressure after the scanner being used to collect image information.The stress area was gradually reduced and the average pressure was gradually increased with increasing flexion angle of the knee. There was significant difference in the stress area and the average pressure between various flexion angles in 4 groups (P < 0.05). Group C had significantly lower stress area and significantly higher average pressure than the other 3 groups (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was found among groups A, B, and D (P > 0.05).The stress of the tibiofemoral articular surface significantly increases after knee meniscus injury or resection, and the average pressure significantly increases. The stress of the tibiofemoral articular surface can be restored to almost normal after meniscus transplantation. Therefore, the injured meniscus should also be retained or repaired in the static state.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Wounds and
