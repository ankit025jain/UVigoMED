{"id":69274,"title":"Delayed ureterectomy after incomplete nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma: pathologic findings and outcomes.","abstract":"To evaluate the pathologic findings and outcomes after distal ureterectomy for a retained ureteral segment following incomplete nephroureterectomy for urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis or ureter.After IRB approval, an institutional database identified patients who underwent distal ureterectomy for a retained ureteral segment after assumed complete nephroureterectomy for urothelial carcinoma of the upper ureter or renal pelvis. Clinical and pathologic variables were analyzed.From January 1993 to July 2007, 12 patients were identified with median age at the time of ureterectomy of 60.5 years (41-85 years). Initial approach to surgery was open in 9 patients and laparoscopic in 3 patients. The median time from nephroureterectomy to distal ureterectomy was 23.5 months (range 2-66). At the time of initial surgery, pathologic stage was Ta, T1, T2, and T3 in 3,4,1, and 4 patients respectively. Initial pathology was urothelial carcinoma; grade 2 in 6 patients and grade 3 in six patients. Pathology from the subsequent surgery demonstrated urothelial carcinoma in the retained ureteral segment in 8 patients, dysplasia or atypia in 3 patients, and 1 patient with chronic inflammation. Local recurrence in 2 patients was present in a segment of ureter discontinuous with the bladder after laparoscopic nephroureterectomy. Three patients (25%), all with initial grade 3 renal pelvis lesions, developed metastatic disease.Tumor recurrence in a retained ureteral segment after incomplete nephroureterectomy is a significant problem and may contribute to intravesical recurrence or metastatic disease. Complete, en bloc resection is imperative to minimize these risks.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456786","annotations":[{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.83444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.80327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.712613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.69847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.545523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.543476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Transitional cell carcinoma","weight":0.416275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.383838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.37928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Atypia","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypia"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.216096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Renal pelvis","weight":0.209345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_pelvis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"}]}
