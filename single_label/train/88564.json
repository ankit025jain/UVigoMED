{"id":88564,"title":"An adaptation of the MMPI-2 Meyers Index for the MMPI-2-RF.","abstract":"Using an overall sample of 278 individuals who had taken the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Second Edition (MMPI-2) and who had clear diagnostic information available in their medical records, the Meyers Index (MI) for the MMPI-2 (Meyers, Millis, & Volkert, 2002 ) was calculated for each individual, and a new version of the MI created for the MMPI-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) was calculated. The MI is a method of combining multiple MMPI-2 validity scales into a single weighted index to assess exaggerated self-report on the MMPI-2. The new index is intended to provide the same type of global assessment of validity but for the MMPI-2-RF (MI-r). The MI and the MI-r were compared at both individual and group levels and were found to correlate well (r = .87). Diagnostic groups of litigants and nonlitigants of traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, and posttraumatic stress disorder were also examined; and the performance of the MI and the MI-r were similar. Similarly, the pass and fail agreement rate for the two scales was 93%. The results indicate that the MI and MI-r perform very similarly and are good methods of assessing overall validity of MMPI-2 and MMPI-2-RF test performance.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24826509","annotations":[{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.873123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.799947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Personality psychology","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.633261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.603533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.511873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.34328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.289614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Minnesota","weight":0.240165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"},{"name":"Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory","weight":0.207246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Brain injury","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_injury"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Michigan","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Performance art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_art"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
