{"id":23452,"title":"Do we need a new vaccine to control the re-emergence of pertussis?","abstract":"Bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough and is re-emerging in developed countries despite widespread immunization with acellular pertussis vaccines (Pa), which are less effective than the whole cell vaccines that they replaced. Efficacy of Pa could be improved by switching from alum to alternative adjuvants that generate more potent cell mediated immunity.
