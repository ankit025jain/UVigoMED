{"id":82551,"title":"Impact of removing mastoid process for advanced parotid cancer on facial nerve identification, preservation and reconstruction.","abstract":"Advanced parotid cancers more than 4 cm are firmly fixed around the main trunk of the facial nerve that can be hardly detected in narrow working space between mastoid process and parotid cancer. Even though facial nerve was preserved, facial nerve stretching during surgery has significantly serious effect on postoperative facial palsy.To evaluate usefulness of removing mastoid process in managing advanced parotid cancers to contribute identifying and preserving facial nerve.The study was performed on 18 advanced parotid cancers which was more than 4 cm and invaded around the facial nerve. Thirteen cases were fresh cases and 5 were recurrent cases.According to a modified Blair incision, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is detached from the mastoid process with electrocautery. When the mastoid process is removed, the main trunk of the facial nerve can be observed from stylomastoid foramen.This procedure was evaluated based on the duration of surgery, working space, and postoperative facial nerve function.In eleven cases, facial nerves were sacrificed. Negative margins were achieved in 100% of the patients. The mean duration for removing of the mastoid process to identify facial nerves was 4.6 minutes. The mean size of the removed mastoid process was 2.1 cm in height and 2.3 cm in width, and 1.8 cm in depth. The extended mean working space was 16.0 cm3, and, as a result, the tumors could be resected without retraction.Removing the mastoid process for advanced parotid tumors facilitates identification of the facial nerve and better preservation of the facial nerve function.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24588993","annotations":[{"name":"Mastoid process","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_process"},{"name":"Sternocleidomastoid muscle","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternocleidomastoid_muscle"},{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Bell's palsy","weight":0.781812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_palsy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.677464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.438377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.267273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.245536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.153173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.14212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Stylomastoid foramen","weight":0.131191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylomastoid_foramen"},{"name":"Cauterization","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauterization"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Office","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office"},{"name":"Stretching","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretching"},{"name":"Single-family detached home","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_detached_home"},{"name":"Transverse foramen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_foramen"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
