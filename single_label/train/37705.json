{"id":37705,"title":"Ischaemic stroke with patent foramen ovale.","abstract":"There is no sound scientific documentation of current guidelines for the treatment of cerebral infarction assumed to be due to patent foramen ovale. In this article, we present a young patient with this condition. In addition, we provide a general overview of the prevalence, recommended assessment and indications for treatment of patent foramen ovale in ischaemic stroke patients.The article is based on a non-systematic search in PubMed. We emphasise three recently published randomised trials on the subject.Transoesophageal echocardiography with saline contrast is the gold standard for detecting patent foramen ovale. Just who will benefit from the diagnosis and treatment of this condition remains unclear, however. None of the three randomised studies of antithrombotic treatment versus transcatheter closure in patients who have suffered ischaemic stroke show a difference in outcomes, but subgroup analyses indicate that closure in young patients (age <50 years) with a large foramen ovale reduces the number of recurrent ischaemic events. Two other randomised studies of antithrombotic treatment alone versus closure are presently ongoing.For stroke patients with patent foramen ovale, the choice between lifelong antithrombotic therapy alone and transcatheter closure is a difficult one. Treatment with antiplatelet agents remains the first choice in most cases. Well-designed studies are needed to identify which patients will benefit most from closure.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477152","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebral infarction","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_infarction"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.819171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.76708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.651453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.587655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.43928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.415311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.319148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.287629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.236608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.214415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0197932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Plasmodium ovale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_ovale"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Foramen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foramen"}]}
