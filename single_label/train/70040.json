{"id":70040,"title":"Demystifying NUT midline carcinoma: radiologic and pathologic correlations of an aggressive malignancy.","abstract":"NUT midline carcinoma is a rare poorly differentiated aggressive subtype of squamous cell carcinoma. To date, fewer than 100 total cases have been reported.Given the rarity of this disease process and lack of pathognomonic imaging findings, a definitive diagnosis based solely on imaging findings alone is untenable. Select cases are used to emphasize the particularly infiltrative and aggressive nature of NUT midline carcinoma, which shows a complete disregard for normal tissue boundaries and rapid progression during brief intervals.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25247968","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.808582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.679898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.6387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.589373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.306078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.300223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Pathognomonic","weight":0.282569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathognomonic"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Subtype polymorphism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtype_polymorphism"},{"name":"Select (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(magazine)"},{"name":"Mean line","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_line"},{"name":"National Union of Teachers","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union_of_Teachers"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
