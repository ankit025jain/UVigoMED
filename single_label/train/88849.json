{"id":88849,"title":"Caring for the postoperative patient with complications presenting to the emergency department.","abstract":"The purpose of the article was to understand that the variations in common surgical procedures, physical, laboratory, and radiographic examinations that are typical in the postoperative patient can help direct treatment options. Nurse practitioners in outpatient settings need to quickly identify and treat postoperative complications. This article discusses three postoperative patients who presented to the emergency department. Data sources included personal health records and review of literature. Various factors that decrease hospital readmission rates include proper discharge education regarding signs and symptoms of infection, importance of medication compliance, and appropriate follow-up care. In addition, the outpatient nurse practitioners' knowledge of the surgical patient and common postoperative ailments will aid in more effective treatment and communication between the nurse practitioner and the surgeon if necessary. Nurse practitioners who have a better understanding of potential postoperative complications will be better equipped to care for this patient population when encountered in a nonsurgical, outpatient setting.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785667","annotations":[{"name":"Nurse practitioner","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_practitioner"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Home care","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_care"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.598289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.551744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.524104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.50411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.377517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.267713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
