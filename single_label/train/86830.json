{"id":86830,"title":"[The morphological characteristics of HIV-associated tuberculosis in relation to blood CD4+ lymphocyte counts].","abstract":"To investigate the morphological features of HIV-associated tuberculosis with different peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte counts.Intraoperative and biopsy specimens from 148 patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis were examined. Group 1 included 16 (10.8%) patients having a CD4+ lymphocyte count above 350 cells/?l; Group 2 comprised 38 (25.7%) patients having 200 to 349 cells/?l; Group 3 consisted of 94 (63.5%) patients with a CD4+ lymphocyte count below 200 cells/?l. Histological and immunohistochemical studies and a polymerase chain reaction assay were used.According to the predominant inflammatory phase, all analyzed cases were divided into 4 patterns of tissue responses: 1) typical productive granulomatous tuberculous inflammation; 2) obscure productive granulomatous inflammation; 3) a predominant alterative phase with the formation of pyonecrotic foci; 4) a predominant exudative tissue response with the development of amorphofunctional pattern typical of nonspecific inflammation. A relationship was found between the count of CD4+ lymphocytes and the predominant pattern of a tissue inflammatory response. A productive component of inflammation prevailed in Group 1; a mild productive response with the significantly obscure features of a granulomatous process was dominant in Group 2; alterative phenomena were noted in Group 3. Most patients (n=132, 89.2%) were stated to have an obscure granulomatous response (n=61, 41.2%), and a preponderance of an alternative (n=48, 32.4%) and vascular (n=23, 15.6%) components of inflammation.The magnitude of alterative and exudative components in the foci of tuberculous inflammation suggested that there was a change-over from a delayed hypersensitivity reaction that was typical of tuberculosis to an immediate hypersensitivity reaction and reflected severe immune system dysfunction.","date":"2014-12-29","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25543406","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.887796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Type IV hypersensitivity","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_IV_hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.490303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.484022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.436373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.416382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.28559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.272191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.265779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.133765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0827578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0229663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
