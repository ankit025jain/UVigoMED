{"id":85814,"title":"Intrapleural minocycline pleurodesis for the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.","abstract":"The role of chemical pleurodesis in the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains unclear. According to current practice guidelines, chemical pleurodesis is reserved for patients who are unable or unwilling to have surgery. Some recent studies showed that intrapleural minocycline pleurodesis could decrease the rate of pneumothorax recurrence, when used either as the initial treatment for simple pneumothorax after successful aspiration and drainage or as an adjuvant treatment for complicated or recurrent pneumothorax following thoracoscopic surgery. The purpose of this review is to discuss the current available evidence on intrapleural minocycline pleurodesis for the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.In a recently published prospective, randomized controlled trial, additional minocycline pleurodesis following simple aspiration and drainage was a well tolerated and more effective initial treatment for a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax than simple aspiration and drainage alone. Other prospective, randomized controlled trials showed that additional minocycline pleurodesis after thoracoscopic treatment was a well tolerated and convenient procedure which can reduce the rate of ipsilateral recurrence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.Intrapleural minocycline pleurodesis can be considered an adjunct to standard treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, after either simple aspiration and drainage or after thoracoscopic surgery.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852327","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pleurodesis","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurodesis"},{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Thoracoscopy","weight":0.565257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracoscopy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.491498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Minocycline","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minocycline"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0520117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"}]}
