{"id":1080,"title":"[Actual problems of cardiovascular risk in urban population of Ukrain].","abstract":"To study cardiovascular (CV) risk in urban population of Ukraine.In a framework of Ukrainian-Russian study conducted in 2009-2013 we registered levels of 20 factors of CV risk in a sample of population of Dnepropetrovsk (n = 1000, 468 men, 532 women, age 30-69 years) and assessed prevalence of very high risk using all variants of the SCORE scale.Factors of CV risk could be distributed into 3 groups according to their prevalence in adult population. Group 1--present in approximately 70% of a population sample: abdominal obesity (criteria of European Society of Cardiology [ESC]), hypercholesterolemia, elevation of low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Group 2--present in about 40% of population sample: abdominal obesity (ATP 3 criteria), arterial hypertension, insulin resistance assessed by HOMA index. Group 3--present in ? 30% of population sample: hypertriglyceridemia, abnormal glucose tolerance, smoking, lowering of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, hyperuricemia, and diabetes.Analysis of prevalence of risk factors and calculation of CV risk in accordance with ESC recommendations (2012) with the use of all three variants of SCORE allowed to estimate dimension of a cohort with high risk of fatal CV complications as 30% of urban population of Ukraine. This should serve as a basis for further multicenter studies and long-term preventive programs.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Cardiovascular
