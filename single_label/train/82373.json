{"id":82373,"title":"[Effects of 4% hypertonic saline solution mouthwash on oral health of elders in long term care facilities].","abstract":"This study was done to examine the effects of 4% hypertonic saline solution mouthwash and tooth brushing education on the oral health of elders living in long term care facilities.In this quasi-experimental study, the participants were assigned to a 2% experimental group (n=20), a 4% experimental group (n=20), and a control group (n=20). Data were analyzed using ANOVA, repeated measures ANOVA, Fisher exact test, Chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test and multiple response analysis with the SAS program.Regular tooth brushing and use of 4% hypertonic saline solution mouthwash by elders provided better oral health by decreasing xerostomia, oral tongue plaque, halitosis, and the number of oral bacteria.The results indicate that regular tooth brushing with continuous 4% hypertonic saline solution mouth washing education promotes oral health for elders in long term care facilities, thus the dental care described in this study is recommended for elders in long term facilities.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637282","annotations":[{"name":"Halitosis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halitosis"},{"name":"Xerostomia","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerostomia"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.811497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Mouthwash","weight":0.749649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthwash"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.388645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Tooth brushing","weight":0.237453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_brushing"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.230777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.197677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.165203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Special Air Service","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service"},{"name":"Tonicity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity"},{"name":"Exact test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Long-term care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_care"},{"name":"Repeated measures design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Washing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
