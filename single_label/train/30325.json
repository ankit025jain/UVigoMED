{"id":30325,"title":"miRNAs and their application in drug-induced liver injury.","abstract":"The complex miRNA regulatory network plays an important role in diverse biological activities of physiopathological processes. In addition to the discovery of and research on the extracellular miRNAs detected in multiple biofluids, the properties of tissue specificity and high stability underlie the great potential of these small miRNAs to serve as translational biomarkers for various diseases in the clinical setting, including in drug-induced liver injury. In this review, we describe the major technologies currently used and challenges in miRNA measurement and provide information on major bioinformatics resources available for current miRNA research. We also discuss novel findings in liver disease and highlight the potential of miRNAs for clinical and basic research as translational biomarkers for drug-induced liver injury.
