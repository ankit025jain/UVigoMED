{"id":53114,"title":"Tumor size, depth of invasion, and histologic grade as prognostic factors of lymph node involvement in endometrial cancer: a SEER analysis.","abstract":"The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the risk of nodal metastasis in patients with endometrial cancer, using the Mayo criteria, in a population-based analysis.Data from the SEER registry was reviewed for endometrial cancer cases diagnosed between 1988 and 2010. Patients were considered at low-risk for nodal metastasis if their tumors were histologic grade 1 or 2, myometrial invasion was less than 50%, and tumor size equal to or less than 2 cm. Patients not meeting these criteria were considered at high-risk for nodal involvement.The final study group consisted of 19,329 women with surgically staged endometrial cancer. Of these, 1035 (5.3%) had lymph node involvement. Based on Mayo criteria, 4095 (21.1%) patients were found to be at low-risk and 15,234 (78.9%) at high-risk for nodal metastasis. Low-risk features were associated with a 1.4% risk for lymph node metastasis, compared to 6.4% in patients with high-risk features (p<0.001). When myometrial invasion was removed from the analysis, low-risk pathologic features were associated with a 2.4% risk of lymph node metastasis, compared to 10.4% in patients with high-risk features (p<0.001).In a population-based analysis, women with low-risk endometrial cancer, as defined by the Mayo criteria, have a low rate of lymph node metastasis.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548726","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Myometrium","weight":0.316275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myometrium"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.235405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results","weight":0.175318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_Epidemiology_and_End_Results"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1988","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988"},{"name":"1035","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1035"},{"name":"234","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/234"},{"name":"Objective (optics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_(optics)"},{"name":"4000 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4000_(number)"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"First grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_grade"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Mayo GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
