{"id":80829,"title":"First characterization of Plasmodium vivax liver stage antigen (PvLSA) using synthetic peptides.","abstract":"Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread human malaria in tropical and subtropical countries, including the Republic of Korea. Vivax malaria is characterized by hypnozoite relapse and long latency infection by the retained liver stage of P. vivax, and somewhat surprisingly, little is known of the liver stage antigens of this parasite. Here, we report for the first time the characterization of a liver stage antigen of P. vivax (PvLSA).Five peptides located inside PvLSA were synthesized, and specific anti-sera to the respective peptides were used to localize PvLSA on P. vivax parasites in human liver cells by immunofluorescence. Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed using the five peptides and sera collected from vivax malaria patients and from normal healthy controls.PvLSA was localized on P. vivax parasites in human liver cells. Vivax malaria-infected patients were detected using the five peptides by western blotting. Furthermore, the peptides reacted with the sera of vivax malaria patients.These results suggest that PvLSA may function during the liver stage of P. vivax.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520895","annotations":[{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.932519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.886361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.82955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.815553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.677915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.667879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Antiserum","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiserum"},{"name":"Subtropics","weight":0.212081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.164585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Western (genre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Peptide synthesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_synthesis"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"}]}
