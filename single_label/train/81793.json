{"id":81793,"title":"Wharton's duct retropapillary approach.","abstract":"Salivary lithiasis is more frequently encountered in patients with Wharton's duct. They are often treated with a minimally invasive technique, such as sialendoscopy. The problem with sialendoscopy, in some cases, has been that it will not be possible to cannulate the papilla and, thus, sialendoscopy will not be feasible. Therefore, we have developed and detailed a retropapillary approach to cannulate Wharton's duct in such cases.
