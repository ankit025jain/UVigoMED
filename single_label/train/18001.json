{"id":18001,"title":"Volatile oils from the aerial parts of Eremophila maculata and their antimicrobial activity.","abstract":"The essential oils isolated from the fresh flowers, fresh leaves, and both fresh and air-dried stems of Eremophila maculata (Scrophulariaceae) were characterized by GC-FID and GC/MS analyses. Sabinene was the major component in most of the oils, followed by limonene, ?-pinene, benzaldehyde, (Z)-?-ocimene, and spathulenol. The leaf and flower essential oils showed antibacterial and antifungal activity against five Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacterial strains, multi-resistant clinical isolates from patients, i.e., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as well as two yeasts. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum microbicidal concentrations (MMCs) were between 0.25 and 4 mg/ml.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827695","annotations":[{"name":"Limonene","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limonene"},{"name":"Benzaldehyde","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzaldehyde"},{"name":"Flower","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.763324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Pinene","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinene"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Essential oil","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil"},{"name":"Yeast","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Scrophulariaceae","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrophulariaceae"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Volatility (chemistry)","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.113788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Sabinene","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabinene"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Microbicide","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbicide"}]}
