{"id":29756,"title":"Genetic and environmental factors underlying comorbid bulimic behaviours and alcohol use disorders: a moderating role for the dysregulated personality cluster?","abstract":"Women with bulimia nervosa (BN) frequently have co-occurring alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Studies of shared genetic transmission of these disorders have been mixed. Personality heterogeneity among individuals with BN may explain discrepant findings. Cluster analysis has characterized women with BN in groups on the basis of personality profiles. One group, the Dysregulated cluster, characterized largely by behavioural disinhibition and emotional dysregulation may be more closely linked etiologically to AUDs. This study examined whether genetic associations between BN and AUDs are the strongest among the Dysregulated cluster. Symptoms of BN and AUDs were assessed in female twins at ages 17 and 25 years from the Minnesota Twin Family Study. Personality clusters were defined using the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire. Twin moderation models suggested small-to-moderate common genetic transmission between BN and AUDs. However, shared genetic effects did not differ by personality cluster. Findings suggest that personality clusters are unlikely to account for inconsistent findings regarding their shared aetiology.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616026","annotations":[{"name":"Bulimia nervosa","weight":0.864417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulimia_nervosa"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.732061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Personality psychology","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"},{"name":"Nature versus nurture","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.501514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.444907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Emotional dysregulation","weight":0.276701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.179976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Minnesota","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Disinhibition","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinhibition"},{"name":"Minnesota Twin Family Study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twin_Family_Study"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.028099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Presenter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenter"},{"name":"Moderation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation"},{"name":"Cluster (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_(band)"},{"name":"Minnesota Twins","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"},{"name":"Mixed-sex education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_education"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
