{"id":69971,"title":"DEAR1, a novel tumor suppressor that regulates cell polarity and epithelial plasticity.","abstract":"Elucidation of the regulatory controls on epithelial plasticity is pivotal not only to better understand the nature of metastasis but also for the design of targeted therapies to prevent the earliest steps in migration and invasion from the primary tumor. This review will highlight the role of the novel TRIM protein DEAR1 (annotated as TRIM62) in the regulation of apical-basal polarity and acinar morphogenesis as well as its function as a chromosome 1p35 tumor suppressor and negative regulator of TGF?-driven epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). DEAR1 binds to and promotes the ubiquitination of SMAD3, the major effector of TGF?-mediated EMT, as well as downregulates SMAD3 targets SNAIL1/2, master transcriptional regulators of EMT. Cumulative results suggest a novel paradigm for DEAR1 in the regulation of the breast tumor microenvironment, polarity, and EMT. Because DEAR1 undergoes loss-of-function mutations, homozygous deletion, as well as copy-number losses in multiple epithelial cancers, including breast cancer, DEAR1 has clinical use as a predictive and prognostic biomarker as well as for stratifying breast cancers and potentially other epithelial tumor types for targeted therapies aimed at the pathways regulated by DEAR1.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25261235","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Mothers
