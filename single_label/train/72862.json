{"id":72862,"title":"Autoantibodies in breast cancer.","abstract":"In addition to their historical role, autoantibodies appear promising as biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis, improve patient outcome and decrease mortality in cancer. Autoantibodies may also be useful in the identification of subjects at risk for cancer, that is, those bearing premalignant changes. Numerous studies have demonstrated that cancer serum contains a variety of autoantibodies that react with autologous cellular antigens, that is, tumor-associated antigens. Interestingly, some of these antigens are involved in signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. As such, identification of these molecules has additional importance for development of novel anticancer drugs and vaccines. This review focuses on the use of autoantibodies in breast cancer, a major public health problem. We also address the need for additional research to validate this approach in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics in general.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24938020","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.73179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.705394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.595998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.593459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.491364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.442143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.339934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Precancerous condition","weight":0.276288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precancerous_condition"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.133777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.102966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Cell cycle checkpoint","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle_checkpoint"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
