{"id":15112,"title":"Benefits of copper recognised worldwide.","abstract":"In an article that first appeared in the June 2014 issue of Health Estate Journal's sister publication, The Clinical Services Journal, the Copper Development Association highlights the growing recognition, both in the UK, and among healthcare research and provider bodies overseas, of the significant part that antimicrobial copper can play in preventing and controlling infection in healthcare settings. Over the past few months, the Association explains, antimicrobial copper's infection-beating properties have been acknowledged by a variety of 'research and horizon-scanning' bodies, among them one in Canada, as well as by a leading UK consultancy and research provider to the NHS. The material is also increasingly being specified by hospitals worldwide following trials which have demonstrated clearly its efficacy in 'beating the bugs'.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282988","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.726623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.52712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.385184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.216883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Police officer","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.0555992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Formula One","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One"},{"name":"Software bug","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"First appearance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_appearance"},{"name":"Diary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"}]}
