{"id":20544,"title":"Miliary tuberculosis with atypical presentation in an immunocompetent young African man.","abstract":"We present an atypical case of tuberculosis in an immunocompetent man from west Africa living in Europe. The patient entered the hospital with a painful lump of 3 cm on his right clavicule which he noticed 2 weeks before and back pain. During the examinations for further evaluation his condition deteriorated within short time. Tuberculosis was diagnosed, treatment started but he needed mechanical ventilation at the intensive care unit and had kidney failure. The further evolvement was favourable in the end but needed intensive treatment for over 4 weeks. Tuberculosis cases with such severe evolution are rather known with immunodeficient patients. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis, especially skeletal tuberculosis is seen more frequent in young immunocompetent migrants. The migrating persons seem to be more at risk to get sick than the ones staying in their origin country. We suppose the course of our patient's disease is miliary or septic, of which both are rather rare entities.
