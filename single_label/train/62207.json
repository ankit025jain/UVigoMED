{"id":62207,"title":"A novel method for the management of patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia during cardiac surgery.","abstract":"A 63-year old, male patient presented with prosthetic valve endocarditis and developed heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT) following heparin administration for continuous veno-venous haemofiltration. Use of cardiopulmonary bypass in patients suffering from heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia is difficult and challenging. We report a novel method that allows heparin use in patients diagnosed with HIT using Multiplate platelet analyser and iloprost. Platelet function analysis is complex, poorly standardized and time consuming. Multiplate platelet analyser represents a convenient, safe, reliable and rapid system that allows the assessment of platelet dysfunction. It allows objective demonstration of platelet inhibition before administration of heparin, allowing safe establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass in patients suffering from HIT.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608730","annotations":[{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.804766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.763479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.738783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.730201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.705736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Automated analyser","weight":0.14433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_analyser"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.110579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Hemofiltration","weight":0.107094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemofiltration"},{"name":"Artificial heart valve","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_heart_valve"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Iloprost","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iloprost"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0193761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Demonstration (people)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_(people)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 63","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_63"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"}]}
