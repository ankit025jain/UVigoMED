{"id":20850,"title":"Povidone-iodine soaks for hand abscesses: a prospective randomized trial.","abstract":"To determine the effect of povidone-iodine soaks on outcomes of hand infections after operative drainage.We performed a single-center, prospective, randomized trial to evaluate 100 consecutive hand infections. Forty-nine patients received povidone-iodine soaks 3 times daily, and 51 patients received only daily dressing changes. Outcome measures were the number of operations, readmissions, reoperations for wound complications, and days spent in the hospital.Patients treated with povidone soaks averaged 1.6 operations, and patients treated with daily dressing changes averaged 1.4 operations, a statistically insignificant difference. The mean number of operations was also not different between groups for the dorsal hand or dorsal finger abscess subcategories. No significant differences were found in length of stay, number of readmissions, or number of reoperations for wound complications.Povidone-iodine soaks are not helpful in the postoperative management of hand infectionsTherapeutic II.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636027","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.466214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.380053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.281115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Polyvinylpyrrolidone","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinylpyrrolidone"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Soakage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soakage"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"}]}
