{"id":63461,"title":"Functional characterization of c-Mpl ectodomain mutations that underlie congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia.","abstract":"Activation of the cell surface receptor, c-Mpl, by the cytokine, thrombopoietin (TPO), underpins megakaryocyte and platelet production in mammals. In humans, mutations in c-Mpl have been identified as the molecular basis of Congenital Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia (CAMT). Here, we show that CAMT-associated mutations in c-Mpl principally lead to defective receptor presentation on the cell surface. In contrast, one CAMT mutant c-Mpl, F104S, was expressed on the cell surface, but showed defective TPO binding and receptor activation. Using mutational analyses, we examined which residues adjacent to F104 within the membrane-distal cytokine receptor homology module (CRM) of c-Mpl comprise the TPO-binding epitope, revealing residues within the predicted Domain 1 E-F and A-B loops and Domain 2 F'-G' loop as key TPO-binding determinants. These studies underscore the importance of the c-Mpl membrane-distal CRM to TPO-binding and suggest that mutations within this CRM that perturb TPO binding could give rise to CAMT.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438083","annotations":[{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.928595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Megakaryocyte","weight":0.914388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megakaryocyte"},{"name":"Thrombopoietin","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombopoietin"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.802825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.723855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.659662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.570497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.409428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Cell surface receptor","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor"},{"name":"Cytokine receptor","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_receptor"},{"name":"Thrombopoiesis","weight":0.0870413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombopoiesis"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.0550013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Ectodomain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectodomain"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Loop (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(music)"},{"name":"Lockheed F-104 Starfighter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-104_Starfighter"},{"name":"Perturbation (astronomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Module (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Underscore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Canon EF lens mount","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EF_lens_mount"},{"name":"Thyroid peroxidase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_peroxidase"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Customer relationship management","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management"}]}
