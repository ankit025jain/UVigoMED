{"id":10036,"title":"The effect of fluoxetine on ischemia-reperfusion after aortic surgery in a rat model.","abstract":"Aortic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) is an important factor in the development of postoperative acute lung injury after abdominal aortic surgery. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of fluoxetine (Flx), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor widely used as a preoperative anxiolytic, on lung injury induced by abdominal aortic IR in rats.Wistar rats were randomized into three groups (n = 7 per group): (1) control (sham laparotomy); (2) IR without Flx (60-min ischemia and 120-min reperfusion); (3) IR with Flx (Flx + IR) (Flx 20 mg/kg/d, intraperitoneally for 3 d before surgery). Lung tissue samples and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were obtained for biochemical analysis of oxidative status. Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) level and protein concentrations in BAL and lung wet to dry weight ratios were determined. Histologic evaluation of the lung tissues was also performed.IR without Flx led to significant increase in lipid hydroperoxide, malondialdehyde, and pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance and decrease in superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and ferric reducing antioxidant power activities (P < 0.05 versus control), whereas Flx was able to restore these parameters (P > 0.05 versus control) and decrease IMA level (P < 0.01 versus control) and protein concentration (P < 0.05 versus control) in BAL and wet to dry lung weight ratio. Histologic evaluation showed that Flx attenuated the morphologic changes associated with lung injury.The results indicate that Flx confers protection against aortic IR-induced lung oxidative stress and cellular integrity. IMA levels in BAL may be used as a follow-up marker for the efficacy of treatment in lung injury.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Animal
