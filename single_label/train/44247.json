{"id":44247,"title":"Diagnostic capabilities of high-definition white light endoscopy for the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia and correlation with histologic and clinical data.","abstract":"The aim of this study was the evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of a specific high-definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE) system for the optical recognition of intestinal metaplasia (IM) and the assessment of its correlation with histologic and clinical data.A total of 234 patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in an outpatient endoscopy suite for various indications were prospectively enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Gastric IM was diagnosed on the basis of three mucosal patterns identified using HD-WLE in a per-patient analysis. Histological evaluation was used as the gold standard, and special staining was conducted for subtyping of IM. Main outcome measurements were sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio of HD-WLE and secondary associations with histologic and clinical data.IM was found in 63/234 (27%) patients and low-grade dysplasia in 6/63 patients (9.5%). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and likelihood ratio of all mucosal patterns were 74.6, 94, 88% and 13, respectively. All clinically significant type III IM and dysplasia lesions were endoscopically detected. All nonvisible lesions were of types I and II with mild grade and no dysplasia. Ten patients were considered false positives and the lesions were associated with severe inflammation and antralization.The specific HD-WLE system showed satisfactory accuracy and high specificity during real-time, routine endoscopy practice. Specific mucosal patterns were correlated with level and grade of lesions. The sensitivity of the system is even higher when only clinically significant IM lesions are considered.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743505","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Metaplasia","weight":0.750072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.52868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.465128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.423723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.319913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Intestinal metaplasia","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_metaplasia"},{"name":"Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing","weight":0.305335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_ratios_in_diagnostic_testing"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.275874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.122913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Visible spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
