{"id":25511,"title":"[Case of sudden asystole during direct laryngoscopy].","abstract":"A 78-year-old man, weighing 74 kg and 172 cm in height suddenly developed asystole during direct laryngoscopy. His heart started beating soon after chest compressions. Direct larygoscopy can stimulate the vagal nerve of the larynx. Although a gradual decrease in heart rate ordinarily occurs prior to asystole, few reports describe the sudden asystole during direct laryngoscopy. Intravenous injection of atropine could avoid the adverse event. Anesthesiologists should pay attention to the occurence of asystole and prepare for resuscitation.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25199323","annotations":[{"name":"Atropine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropine"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Vagus nerve","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.609985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.579085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Asystole","weight":0.576482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asystole"},{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0230596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Wrestling at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's Greco-Roman 74 kg","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_-_Men's_Greco-Roman_74_kg"}]}
