{"id":47741,"title":"Cysteinyl leukotrienes and their receptors: bridging inflammation and colorectal cancer.","abstract":"Long-standing inflammation has emerged as a hallmark of neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells and may be a limiting factor of successful conventional tumor therapies. A complex milieu composed of distinct stromal and immune cells, soluble factors and inflammatory mediators plays a crucial role in supporting and promoting various types of cancers. An augmented inflammatory response can predispose a patient to colorectal cancer (CRC). Common risk factors associated with CRC development include diet and lifestyle, altered intestinal microbiota and commensals, and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. Cysteinyl leukotrienes are potent inflammatory metabolites synthesized from arachidonic acid and have a broad range of functions involved in the etiology of various pathologies. This review discusses the important role of cysteinyl leukotriene signaling in linking inflammation and CRC.
