{"id":63616,"title":"Tuberculosis of the thymus in a 6-month-old infant with literature review.","abstract":"Tuberculosis of the thymus is very uncommon. Most previously reported cases have involved adolescents or adults. Herein, we report a case of tuberculosis of the thymus diagnosed in a 6-month-old infant, presenting with progressive dyspnea and a mediastinal mass. Both clinical and radiologic findings were nonspecific, while pathologic findings confirmed thymic tissue with massive caseous granulomas consistent with tuberculosis.
