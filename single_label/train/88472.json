{"id":88472,"title":"Is age of the patient an independent predictor influencing the management of cranio-maxillo-facial trauma? A retrospective study of 308 patients.","abstract":"To determine whether patient age is an independent predictor of indication for surgical treatment, realization of surgical procedure, and care management modality.We analyzed data of 308 patients with facial fractures. Patients were classified into four age groups: (1) 17 to 40 years old; (2) 41 to 64 years old; (3) 65 to 80 years old; (4) more than 81 years old.Multivariate analysis showed that the patient's age was associated with decreased indication and realization rate for surgery (P = .03 in Group 3; P = .05 in Group 4) and with an increased hospitalization rate (P = .004 in Group 3; P = .02 in Group 4). The presence of concomitant injuries and the fracture's location were associated with a decreased indication and realization rate for surgery regardless age.The current study demonstrated that the patient's age was an independent predictor influencing the treatment decision and realization process as well as the care management modality.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842446","annotations":[{"name":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.401841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.204051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.15545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Conditions races","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_races"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"308","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/308"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Independent film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Chronic care management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_care_management"}]}
