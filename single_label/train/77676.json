{"id":77676,"title":"Social stressors at work and sleep during weekends: the mediating role of psychological detachment.","abstract":"Social stressors at work may result in long-term health impairments if recovery is insufficient. In the present psychophysiological field study, we tested whether the inability to psychologically detach from work issues mediates the negative effect of social stressors at work on sleep during weekends. Sixty full-time employees participated in the study. Daily assessment included diaries on psychological detachment and continuous ambulatory actigraphy to assess psychophysiological indicators of sleep. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that enduring social stressors at work were negatively related with psychological detachment on Sunday evening and negatively related with various sleep indicators on Sunday night. Furthermore, psychological detachment from work on Sunday evening partially mediated the effect of social stressors at work on two sleep indicators. Social stressors at work may threaten recovery processes just before the working week starts.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447223","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Psychophysiology","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysiology"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.357346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.248181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Hierarchy","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy"},{"name":"Actigraphy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actigraphy"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Starting pitcher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher"},{"name":"Mediation (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation_(statistics)"},{"name":"Diary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"},{"name":"Ambulatory","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Business process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process"},{"name":"NBC Sunday Night Football","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sunday_Night_Football"},{"name":"Field study","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_study"}]}
