{"id":41808,"title":"Effect of biliary cirrhosis on neurogenic relaxation of rat gastric fundus and anococcygeus muscle: role of nitric oxide pathway.","abstract":"Cirrhosis, associated with a host of hemodynamic abnormalities, could affect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract motility. On the other hand, the nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) neurotransmission has been shown to play a pivotal role in GI tract motility and has been linked with release of nitric oxide (NO) on electrical stimulation. In this study, we investigated the effect of biliary cirrhosis on the neurogenic relaxation of rat gastric fundus and anococcygeus muscle and also the possible role of nitric oxide system in this manner.Isolated gastric fundus and anococcygeus strips of sham-operated and biliary cirrhotic (4 weeks after bile duct ligation) rats were mounted under tension in a standard organ bath. Electrical stimulation was applied to obtain NANC-mediated relaxations in precontracted gastric fundus and anococcygeus muscle. The neurogenic relaxations were examined in the presence of different doses of NO synthase inhibitor, N (w)-Nitro-L-Arginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME). The concentration-dependent relaxant responses to the NO donor sodium nitroprusside were also evaluated.The neurogenic relaxation of both gastric fundus and anococcygeus muscle was significantly (P < 0.001) increased in cirrhotic animals. L-NAME (0.03-1,000 µM) inhibited relaxations in both groups in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.001), but cirrhotic groups were more resistant to the inhibitory effects of L-NAME (P < 0.01). Sodium nitroprusside-mediated relaxations were similar in two groups.This study for the first time demonstrated that cirrhosis increases the NO-mediated neurogenic relaxation of both rat gastric fundus and anococcygeus muscle, suggesting a crucial role for the neurogenic NO in the pathophysiology of disturbed GI motility in cirrhosis.","date":"2014-10-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24898099","annotations":[{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Neurotransmission","weight":0.857772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmission"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.756169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.68777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.65653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Ester","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.466486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.366363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.331296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Sodium nitroprusside","weight":0.282443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_nitroprusside"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Muscle relaxant","weight":0.242916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxant"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.16904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Primary biliary cirrhosis","weight":0.140191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_biliary_cirrhosis"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Fundus (stomach)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(stomach)"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Relaxation technique","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_technique"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"}]}
