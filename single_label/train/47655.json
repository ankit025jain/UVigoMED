{"id":47655,"title":"Anterior overlapping sphincteroplasty--who benefits from the surgery?","abstract":"The aim of the study was to identify clinical factors which could influence the results of overlapping sphincteroplasty.Between 2003-2009 the group of 78 incontinent patients (59 women, mean age of 61±13 years), was operated on with anterior overlapping anal sphincteroplasty. Only patients with severe incontinence (>16 pts in Wexner scale) were included. Before surgery and in follow-up period anorectal ultrasound, manometry and incontinence assessment were performed and in follow-up period patients additionally fulfilled survey. The study was prospective. Follow up period was more than 36 months.In survey the excellent results related to 52 patients (66.7%), good in 15 (19.2%) and poor in 11 (14.1%). The squeeze pressure improved more significantly in men 33±11 cm H2O vs. 22±14 cm H2O; p=0.039. In patients <50 year squeeze pressure was significantly larger 32±10 cm H2O vs. 25±12 cm H2O; p=0.045. If the width of a defect within sphincter was less than 60° the improvement in squeeze pressure was higher 33±9 cm H2O vs. 22±15 cm H2O; p=0.031. In Wexner scale male patients better responded to surgery than females 6.94±1.8 vs. 5.12±2.2, p=0.048; as well as patients with smaller scar <60° 6.51±1.4 vs. 4.28±2.3; p=0.042.To succeed in sphincteroplasty the proper qualification to the procedure should be crucial. Clinical assessment prior to surgery with the use of all available non-surgical methods in patients suffer from severe symptoms can help to select optimal group who will benefit from surgery. Male patients may have to obtain better outcome and patients with smaller sphincter defect could likely have also better results from surgery.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24578452","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.763194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.734816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.63455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.375509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.353741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.322903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.312037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.294679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.270446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0484734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Manometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manometry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"23rd century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23rd_century_BC"},{"name":"941","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/941"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Anorectal anomalies","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectal_anomalies"},{"name":"Barotrauma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barotrauma"},{"name":"Wexner Center for the Arts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wexner_Center_for_the_Arts"},{"name":"Nokia 3210","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3210"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"Properties of water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"}]}
