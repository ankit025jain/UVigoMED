{"id":40657,"title":"Neurogastroenterology: Neuronal correlates of placebo in chronic FGIDs.","abstract":"Placebo analgesia is increasingly appreciated in many difficult to treat chronic functional gastrointestinal disorders such as IBS. However, investigations of interactions between psychological and biological placebo factors are still in early stages. Now, technologies have been developed that enable neural mechanisms of placebo analgesia to be studied more directly in humans.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25001971","annotations":[{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.606186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.374462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.262524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.186405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neurophysiology","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophysiology"},{"name":"Functional gastrointestinal disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_gastrointestinal_disorder"},{"name":"Digestive disease","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_disease"}]}
