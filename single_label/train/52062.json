{"id":52062,"title":"Statins, aspirin and risk of thromboembolic events in ovarian cancer patients.","abstract":"Studies suggest that statins and low dose aspirin reduce risk of VTEs in the general population. We aimed to study the effect of these drugs on the incidence of VTEs in patients with ovarian cancer.Patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer between 2000 and 2011 were identified through the Clalit Health Services (CHS) chronic disease registry. Data were extracted from CHS database and from computerized pharmacy records. Use of medications was analyzed as a time dependent covariate in a Cox regression model.Of 1746 patients 175 (10%) had a VTE during a median follow up of 3.13 years. 83 patients (5.6%) had a VTE within 2 years of diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Use of chemotherapy and stage 3 and 4 at presentation were associated with an increased risk for VTEs. Statins were used by 43.5% of the patients, and 32.3% used aspirin. Aspirin use was associated with a marginally significant reduction in incidence of VTEs within 2 years of diagnosis, HR 0.423 (95% CI 0.182-1.012, p-value 0.053). Statin use was not associated with risk of VTEs.This is the first study looking at the effect of statins and aspirin on the incidence of VTEs in ovarian cancer patients. In our cohort, statins did not decrease the risk for a VTE and aspirin use was associated with a reduced risk which was marginally significant. Our results might be explained by use of low potency statins and by alternate mechanisms for VTE formation in cancer patients.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System
