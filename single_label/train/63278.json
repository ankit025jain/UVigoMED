{"id":63278,"title":"Multiple FDG-avid injection site granulomas due to lovenox injection.","abstract":"An initial staging FDG PET/CT scan in a 15-year-old female patient with lymphoma revealed FDG-avid tumor in the mediastinum and the neck. After chemotherapy, a restaging PET/CT scan was performed. Although mediastinal and cervical lesions were not visualized, multiple new foci of activity were noted in the bilateral anterior thighs, which corresponded to soft tissue nodules in the subcutaneous tissue on the low-dose CT. On the third PET/CT study, multiple new foci appeared in the subcutaneous tissue in the anterior abdomen. Additional clinical history was obtained, indicating multiple recent subcutaneous injections of anticoagulants.
