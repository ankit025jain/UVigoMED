{"id":42803,"title":"DNA methylation of microRNA-124a is a potential risk marker of colitis-associated cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis.","abstract":"Colitis-associated cancer (CAC) is the serious complication of ulcerative colitis (UC), and molecular markers to evaluate the individual risk are required. MicroRNA-124a (miR - 124a) is known to have tumor-suppressive function and be methylation-silenced during exposure to chronic inflammation.We analyzed whether higher methylation levels of miR-124a genes correlated with the higher epidemiologic risk of CAC development in UC patients.Forty UC patients without CAC, four patients with CAC or dysplasia, eight sporadic colorectal cancer (S-CRC) patients, and 12 healthy volunteers (HV) were studied. Methylation status of miR-124a genes (miR-124a-1, -2, and -3) was analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP), and methylation levels were quantified by real-time MSP. Expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), a target of miR-124a, was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.Three miR-124a genes were methylated in all neoplastic tissues (CAC, dysplasia, and S-CRC), and CDK6 was highly expressed in those tissues. Regarding disease extent, mean methylation levels of miR-124a-3 in HV, non-pancolitis, and pancolitis were 2.0, 5.3, and 12.3%, respectively, and were significantly higher in pancolitis than in HV (p < 0.01). Regarding disease duration, mean methylation levels in short-term and long-standing UC patients were 2.5 and 13.2%, respectively. Long-standing UC patients had significantly higher methylation levels than HV (p < 0.01). Moreover, UC patients with both pancolitis and long-standing had 7.4-fold higher methylation levels than those without these risk factors.MiR-124a genes are methylated during carcinogenesis in UC patients. The methylation level of miR-124a-3 is a promising marker for estimating individual risk for CAC.","date":"2014-09-13","categories":"Digestive System
