{"id":85171,"title":"High tracheal bifurcation: an unusual cause of left bronchial obstruction.","abstract":"Congenitally short trachea is an uncommon abnormality. It is characterized by a reduced number of tracheal cartilage rings. As a result, the carina is situated at a higher level than usual. That causes the left main bronchus to course abnormally behind the arch of the aorta, rendering it prone to compression. We report the case of an infant who underwent successful aortopexy of the aortic arch for this condition.
