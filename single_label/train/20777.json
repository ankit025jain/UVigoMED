{"id":20777,"title":"Long-term follow-up after thoracoscopic resection of solitary pulmonary tuberculoma.","abstract":"Pulmonary tuberculosis continues to be a significant health problem, especially due to increasing incidence of multi-resistant mycobacteria and patients with immunodeficiency. Pulmonary tuberculoma, like other solitary lung nodules, can often be a diagnostic challenge; moreover no consensus exists on the management strategy.To analyze the results of tuberculoma treatment with thoracoscopic lung resection, followed by anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT).All patients who underwent thoracoscopic resection of tuberculoma between 1996 and 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. The diagnosis was confirmed morphologically and/or microbiologically. Data were collected from case reports, outpatient medical records, Estonian Tuberculosis Registry and National Population Registry.Forty-three patients (25 men, 18 women) with mean age of 43.3 (range 15-68) years were included. Thoracoscopic approach was converted to thoracotomy in three cases. Median postoperative stay in surgical department was four days. No intra-hospital mortality occurred. Eleven patients received pre-operative ATT for 8 to 288 (median 115) days and 42 patients were treated post-operatively for 40 to 672 (median 185) days. One patient defaulted in ATT. First-line drugs were prescribed in 37 and second-line in five patients. During the median follow-up of 9.0 (range 3.2 to 16.1) years, none of the patients developed relapse.Thoracoscopic pulmonary resection provides a minimally invasive opportunity for morphological and microbiological diagnosis of tuberculoma; and results in an excellent cure rate in combination with ATT.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640345","annotations":[{"name":"Thoracotomy","weight":0.873279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.727567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.568876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.554678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.454221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.454162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Thoracoscopy","weight":0.452522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracoscopy"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.381543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.276462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.124614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Religious conversion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion"},{"name":"1996","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996"},{"name":"Default (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(finance)"},{"name":"2008 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Estonian language","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
