{"id":90820,"title":"Wound healing: part II. Clinical applications.","abstract":"Treatment of all wounds requires adequate wound bed preparation, beginning with irrigation and d√©bridement. Complicated or chronic wounds may also require treatment adjuncts or specialized wound healing products. An extensive body of research and development has introduced novel wound healing therapies and scar management options. In this second of a two-part continuing medical education series on wound healing, the reader is offered an update on current wound healing technologies and recommendations for obtaining optimal outcomes.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24572884","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Medical education","weight":0.453195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.324085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.250192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Research and development","weight":0.227383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.223314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.130071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Continuing medical education","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_medical_education"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Adjuncts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuncts"},{"name":"Chronic wound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_wound"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complicated_(Avril_Lavigne_song)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"}]}
