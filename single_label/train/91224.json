{"id":91224,"title":"Head injury and unclear mechanism of injury: initial hematocrit less than 30 is predictive of abusive head trauma in young children.","abstract":"Head injury secondary to abusive head trauma (AHT) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in susceptible young infants and children. Diagnosing AHT remains challenging and is often complicated by a questionable mechanism of injury. Concern of ionizing radiation risk to children undergoing head CT imaging warrants a selective approach. We aimed to evaluate initial findings that could direct further investigation of AHT.A retrospective review of the trauma databases at a two level one pediatric trauma centers was performed. We reviewed all patients age five years and under with a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) from 2002-2011.A total of 1129 patients (mean age 1.7 Â± 1.7 years; 64% male) with TBI were identified, 429 (38%) of which were the result of AHT. Complete data was available for 921 patients (82%) and were included in statistical evaluation. Forty-eight percent of patients in the AHT group had a hematocrit ? 30% on presentation compared to 19% of patients in the non-AHT group. On univariate analysis, a hematocrit of ? 30% was predictive of AHT as the cause of injury (P<.0001), as was a platelet count of greater than 400,000 (P<.0001). After controlling for age, sex, ISS, GCS on presentation, need for CPR, and survival to hospital discharge, hematocrit of ? 30% and platelets of greater than 400,000 were predictive of AHT as the cause of TBI (P<.05).In the setting of head injury and unclear history of trauma, a hematocrit of ? 30% on presentation increases the likelihood of abusive head trauma in children up to the age of 5 years.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528981","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.862193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Ionizing radiation","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.750883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Glasgow Coma Scale","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.725335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.64351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.621221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.422166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.34099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.264614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.119746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"International Space Station","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
