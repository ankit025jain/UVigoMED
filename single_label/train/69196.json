{"id":69196,"title":"Assessment of sexual dysfunction and determination of its risk factors in the Republic of Korea.","abstract":"To assess sexual function among women via self-evaluation of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) and to determine risk factors for FSD among Korean women.A preliminary questionnaire-based study in Ansan, Korea, enrolled 935 women between January and December 2010. Participants completed the Female Sexual Function Index and a self-administered survey. Participants were divided into 2 groups: in the recognized group (RG), women were aware of their sexual problems; in the unrecognized group (URG), women were not.The prevalence of FSD was 46.1% (n=431). The prevalence of recognized FSD was 21.5% (n=201), whereas that of unrecognized FSD was 24.6% (n=230) Younger women showed a significantly more positive attitude toward sex compared with older individuals (P<0.001). Sexual desire, sexual arousal, dyspareunia, lubrication, and sexual satisfaction were factors of sexual dysfunction in the RG. In the URG, sexual arousal, sexual desire, orgasm, dyspareunia, and sexual satisfaction were identified as significant factors.Women in the RG had positive attitudes toward sex, whereas those in the URG had negative attitudes. Women who were unsatisfied with their sexual life did not express a need for treatment. The sociocultural background of Korean women should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of FSD.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462326","annotations":[{"name":"Dyspareunia","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspareunia"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Sexual arousal","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_arousal"},{"name":"Female sexual arousal disorder","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_sexual_arousal_disorder"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Orgasm","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Libido","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.388159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Arousal","weight":0.383106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arousal"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.358949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Lubrication","weight":0.300717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubrication"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Sexual function","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_function"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Republic of Ireland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"},{"name":"Korean language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Optimism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism"}]}
