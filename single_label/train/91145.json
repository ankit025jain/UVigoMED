{"id":91145,"title":"Developing a trauma curriculum for anesthesiology residents and fellows.","abstract":"The board certification process for qualification by the American Board of Anesthesiology is undergoing significant review. A basic sciences examination has been added to the process and the traditional oral examination is evolving into a combined oral interview and practical skills assessment. These recent developments, as well as the growing body of evidence regarding the resuscitation of trauma patients, call for a revision in the curriculum beyond the documentation of participation in the anesthetics of 20 trauma patients.The implications of the 80-h work week are beginning to be appreciated. The development of a new trauma curriculum must take this significant change in residency training into account while incorporating modern educational theory (e.g. simulation) and new data on the resuscitation of trauma patients.Currently, the curriculum for trauma anesthesia requires only that residents participate in the anesthetics of 20 trauma patients. There is no plan for, and little literature regarding, a more extensive educational program. This offers a unique opportunity to innovate a novel curriculum in the anesthesiology residency. The American Society of Anesthesiologists Committee on Trauma and Emergency Preparedness has designed a curriculum that can serve as a template for this important step forward in anesthesiology education.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24535188","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.664199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Curriculum","weight":0.615926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.499871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.310572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Emergency management","weight":0.236641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.209937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.13571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Residency (medicine)","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Innovation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Certification","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification"},{"name":"American Society of Anesthesiologists","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Anesthesiologists"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Professional certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_certification"},{"name":"Fundamental science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_science"},{"name":"Board certification","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_certification"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Philosophy of education","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_education"}]}
