{"id":79294,"title":"[Mastoidectomy with reconstruction of the posterior canal wall and obliteration preventing postoperative morbidity].","abstract":"A cholesteatoma in the mastoid or in the middle ear presents a hazard to the well-being of patients. Commonly used surgical interventions are not an ideal solution as they bear with them postoperative morbidity such as the need for water precautions, a high rate of cholesteatoma recurrence and the inability to undergo hearing rehabilitation.Forty-five patients underwent an innovative surgical procedure that enables complete removal of the cholesteatoma, preservation of ear anatomy and hearing restoration. Our series was divided into two groups. The first group comprised those in whom this innovative procedure was the first one and the posterior bony canal was preserved (primary surgery). The second group comprised those in whom the bony wall had been removed previously during surgery (secondary surgery).In the first group, which included 29 patients, the middle ear cavity was found to be aerated in 69% of the patients, the tympanic membrane was intact in 93% and the rate of cholesteatoma recurrence was 10.3%. In the second group, which included 16 patients, the middle ear cavity was found to be aerated in 56.2% of cases, the tympanic membrane was intact in 75% and the rate of cholesteatoma recurrence was 25%.Mastoidectomy reconstruction of the posterior wall and obliteration (MAPRO) was found to be an effective approach for completely removing a choLesteatoma and preventing cholesteatoma recurrence. It is water-safe and provides an excellent basis for hearing restoration. The use of the original posterior bony canal for middle ear reconstruction was found to be beneficial. The authors advise an MRI study 18 months after surgery for cholesteatoma detection.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450032","annotations":[{"name":"Eardrum","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eardrum"},{"name":"Cholesteatoma","weight":0.830425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesteatoma"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.556912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Ossicles","weight":0.509985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicles"},{"name":"Mastoid process","weight":0.352404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_process"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.167108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.152729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Mastoidectomy","weight":0.107611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoidectomy"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Bear","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Mastoid antrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_antrum"},{"name":"Aeration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeration"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Ideal solution","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_solution"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Posterior semicircular canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_semicircular_canal"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
