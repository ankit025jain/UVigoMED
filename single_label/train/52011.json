{"id":52011,"title":"Diabetes-specific quality of life but not health status is independently associated with glycaemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional analysis of the ADDITION-Europe trial cohort.","abstract":"To examine the association between health status, diabetes-specific quality of life (QoL) and glycaemic control among individuals with type 2 diabetes.1876 individuals with screen-detected diabetes and a mean age of 66 years underwent assessment of self-reported health status (SF-36), diabetes-specific QoL (the Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL19)) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at five years post-diagnosis in the ADDITION-Europe trial. Multivariable linear regression was used to quantify the cross-sectional association between health status, diabetes-specific QoL and HbA1c, adjusting for age, sex, education, alcohol consumption, physical activity, BMI, intake of any glucose-lowering drugs, and trial arm.The mean (SD) SF-36 physical and mental health summary scores were 46.2 (10.4) and 54.6 (8.6), respectively. The median average weighted impact ADDQoL score was -0.32 (IQR -0.89 to -0.06), indicating an overall negative impact of diabetes on QoL. Individuals who reported a negative impact of diabetes on their QoL had higher HbA1c levels at five years after diagnosis compared with those who reported a positive or no impact of diabetes (b-coefficient [95% CI]: b=0.2 [0.1, 0.3]). Physical and mental health summary SF-36 scores were not significantly associated with HbA1c in multivariable analysis.Diabetes-specific QoL but not health status was independently associated with HbA1c. Practitioners should take account of the complex relationship between diabetes-specific QoL and glucose, particularly with regard to dietary behaviour. Future research should attempt to elucidate via which pathways this association might act.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Endocrine System
