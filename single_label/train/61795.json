Further evaluation revealed underlying lymphoproliferative malignancy (chronic lymphocytic leukemia). The synchronous presence of these two diseases suggested the skin lesion as a paraneoplastic manifestation of the underlying neoplasia.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669679","annotations":[{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.92289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.736572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.681066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Lymphoproliferative disorders","weight":0.579145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoproliferative_disorders"},{"name":"Paraneoplastic syndrome","weight":0.552466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraneoplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Pemphigus","weight":0.533237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemphigus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Gondar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondar"},{"name":"Gondar College of Medical Sciences","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondar_College_of_Medical_Sciences"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Types of volcanic eruptions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions"}]}
