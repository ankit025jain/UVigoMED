{"id":46364,"title":"Diagnosing hepatitis C virus and improved outcomes in overall and kidney graft survival among simultaneous liver-kidney transplant recipients in the post-MELD era.","abstract":"We compared survival outcomes among simultaneous liver-kidney transplants after model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) according to their specific diagnosis and hepatitis C virus versus nonhepatitis C virus.Clinical data review was performed for all patients who underwent combined liver-kidney transplants at Johns Hopkins Hospital from January 31, 1995, to October 31, 2012. Differences in demographics and characteristics among 2 groups were compared using independent samples t test. Survival analysis and distributions were calculated using Kaplan-Meier and Mantel-Cox log-rank test.Of 48 combined liver-kidney transplants, 31 simultaneous liver-kidney transplants cases were included; nonsimultaneous liver-kidney transplants and patients with prior transplants were excluded. Proportions of age, sex, ethnicity, pre-MELD score, pretransplant renal replacement therapy requirement, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and follow-up were similar in both groups. Median follow-up was 30 months. Overall and graft survival rates among simultaneous liver-kidney transplants recipients in the pre-MELD era were significantly superior to simultaneous liver-kidney transplants patients in the post-MELD era (P = .0473). However, overall and graft survival rates among simultaneous liver-kidney transplants recipients who had hepatitis C virus and non-hepatitis C virus causes were not statistically different.We demonstrated a statistically significant difference in overall and kidney graft survival between the post-MELD era and the pre-MELD era. Subgroup analyses of this group showed no statistically significant difference in overall and kidney-graft survival when compared with their specific diagnosis of hepatitis C virus. This must be further studied and verified in a larger cohort of patients to fully identify the effect of hepatitis C virus infection in this group of patients because it can affect both liver and kidney grafts after transplant.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635792","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.683713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.591205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.39817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Johns Hopkins Hospital","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Hospital"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.198894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.133789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Johns Hopkins University","weight":0.115901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Renal replacement therapy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"January 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_31"},{"name":"October 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_31"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
