{"id":50329,"title":"Supporting behaviour change in older people with type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"This article examines current research on behaviour change in relation to supporting older adults with type 2 diabetes in the community. It outlines the different areas of self-care that older adults with diabetes engage in, argues for the need for behaviour change intervention in adults with the illness and discusses the complexities of diabetes self-care regimens, with particular focus on older adults. A review of current scientific thinking about eliciting behaviour change in areas such as diet, physical activity and medication taking is undertaken. The article concludes with a set of practical recommendations for community health professionals.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800323","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Community health","weight":0.735806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.729365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.623718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.481543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Behavior change (public health)","weight":0.220725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_change_(public_health)"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.212661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"}]}
