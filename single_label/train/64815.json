{"id":64815,"title":"MRI findings after prostatic artery embolization for treatment of benign hyperplasia.","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to assess and describe the MRI findings after prostatic artery embolization for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.We retrospectively evaluated 17 patients who underwent prostatic artery embolization as part of different prospective studies to evaluate this alternative treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Clinical results were evaluated by assessment of urinary catheterization and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Serial MRI examinations were performed, and the prostatic central gland and peripheral zone were evaluated for signal intensity changes and the presence and characteristics of infarcted areas. Statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA for repeated measures and Student t test.All patients had clinical success, as defined by the removal of indwelling urinary catheter or decreased IPSS after embolization. Infarcts were seen in 70.6% of the subjects, exclusively in the central gland, were almost always characterized by hyperintensity on T1-weighted images and predominant hypointensity on T2-weighted images, and became smaller (mean reduction, p < 0.001) and isointense to the remaining of the central gland over time. Volume reduction of the prostate after embolization was significant (averaging 32.0% after 12-18 months; p < 0.001) only in patients with infarcts. No statistically significant association was seen between the development of infarcts and IPSS.MRI can be used for assessing the development of infarcts and volume reduction in the prostate after embolization. Further studies are needed to correlate these findings to clinical outcome.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25247946","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary catheterization","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_catheterization"},{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.847526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.798092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.773455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Foley catheter","weight":0.678539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_catheter"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.572908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.270876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.222269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.218921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.205945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.18786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Voxel-based morphometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel-based_morphometry"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"}]}
