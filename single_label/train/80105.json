{"id":80105,"title":"[Evaluation of integrated control measures for soil-transmitted nematodiasis in Jinhu County, Jiangsu Province].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of integrated control measures on soil-transmitted nematodiasis so as to provide the evidence for formulating the appropriate control strategies and measures in Jinhu County, Jiangsu Province.Since 1995, the comprehensive control measures were carried out for soil-transmitted nematodiasis, and the measures included deworming, health education, safe water, sanitation and environmental remediation. The effects of the comprehensive control measures were evaluated by the investigations of the prevalence of soil-transmitted nematodiasis, awareness of health knowledge, and behaviors of residents.From 1995 to 2012, 646,437 person--times were administrated in deworming medication with 2.48 times per capita; the benefit rate of safe water was 97.90%; the popularity rate of harmless toilets was 86.89%. The awareness rate of health knowledge increased from 54.05% in 1996 to 95.60% in 2012, the difference between them were statistically significant (chi2 = 230.92, P < 0.01); the rate of correct health behaviors increased from 59.07% in 1996 to 96.40% in 2012, the difference between them had statistical significance (chi2 = 202.69, P < 0.01). The prevalence of soil-transmitted nematodiasis decreased from 62.57% in 1989 to 1.21% in 2012, the difference had statistical significance (chi2 = 1016.92, P < 0.01). The infection rates of Ascaris lumbricodes, hookworm and Trichuris trichiura were 0.58%, 1.12% and 0, respectively in 2012, and compared with the rates of those infections in 1989, the decline rates were 94.96%, 97.28% and 100% respectively, the differences between them were statistically significant (chi2 Ascaris = 129.50, chi2 hookworm = 544.62, chi2 Trichurisch = 254.19, all P < 0.01).The comprehensive control strategies and measures are effective and soil-transmitted nematodiasis has been controlled in Jinhu County.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800572","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.66604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Hookworm","weight":0.640466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookworm"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.579715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.422042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.314275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Toilet","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet"},{"name":"Per capita","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Trichuris trichiura","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichuris_trichiura"},{"name":"Jiangsu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu"},{"name":"Environmental remediation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_remediation"},{"name":"Deworming","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deworming"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"1996","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"1989","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"254","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/254"},{"name":"1016","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1016"},{"name":"646","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/646"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Trichinosis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichinosis"},{"name":"Control system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Ascaris","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris"}]}
