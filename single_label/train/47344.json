{"id":47344,"title":"Opposing effects of aspirin and anticoagulants on morbidity and mortality in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.","abstract":"We aimed to determine the effect of antithrombotics on in-hospital mortality and morbidity in patients with peptic ulcer disease-related upper gastrointestinal bleeding (PUD-related UGIB).The study cohort was retrospectively selected from a tertiary center database of patients with PUD-related UGIB, defined as bleeding due to gastric or duodenal ulcers, or erosive duodenitis, gastritis or esophagitis. Outcomes were compared among patient groups based on their antithrombotic medications before admission. Patients on no antithrombotics served as controls. The composite adverse outcomes, in-hospital mortality, rebleeding and/or need for surgery were measured. Severe bleeding and in-hospital complications were also recorded.Of 398 patients with PUD-related UGIB, 44.5% were on aspirin or anticoagulants only. The composite adverse outcome was most common in patients taking anticoagulants only (40.5%), intermediate in controls (23.1%) and least in those taking aspirin only (12.1%). On multivariate analysis, patients taking aspirin alone had a significantly lower risk of adverse outcome events (odds ratio [OR] 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8) and a shorter length of hospital stay (regression coefficient?=?-3.4, 95% CI [-6.6, -0.6]). In contrast, taking anticoagulants was associated with a greater risk of adverse outcome events (OR?2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.3), severe bleeding (OR?2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.8) and in-hospital complications (OR?2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.6).Patients with PUB-related UGIB while taking aspirin had fewer adverse outcomes compared with those taking anticoagulants. Aspirin may have beneficial effects in this population.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24593260","annotations":[{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.87818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Esophagitis","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagitis"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.801103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.780391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.699312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Upper gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.620804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.57094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.566711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.365411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Duodenitis","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenitis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.174482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
