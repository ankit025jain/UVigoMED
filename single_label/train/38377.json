{"id":38377,"title":"Global aphasia without hemiparesis caused by a dural arteriovenous fistula.","abstract":"A 61-year-old Japanese woman with chronic renal failure suddenly became silent at the end of hemodialysis. On a neurological examination, she was unable to respond to one-step commands, state the names of objects, repeat single words, read words aloud or write her name. Because she exhibited no paralysis of the extremities, we diagnosed her as having global aphasia without hemiparesis (GAWH). Cerebral angiography showed a dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in the left isolated transverse sinus with leptomeningeal venous drainage (Borden type 3, Lalwani grade 4). This case highlights dural AVF as an etiology of GAWH.
