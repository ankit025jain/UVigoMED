{"id":75128,"title":"The epigenetic landscape of Alzheimer's disease.","abstract":"Two independent epigenome-wide association studies of Alzheimer’s disease cohorts have identified overlapping methylation signals in four loci, ANK1, RPL13, RHBDF2 and CDH23, not previously associated with Alzheimer’s disease. These studies also suggest that epigenetic changes contribute more to Alzheimer’s disease than expected.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25157507","annotations":[{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.370962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.36328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.321708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Epigenetic landscape","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetic_landscape"},{"name":"CDH23","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDH23"},{"name":"RPL13","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPL13"},{"name":"ANK1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANK1"},{"name":"Landscape architecture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_architecture"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"ANKH","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANKH"},{"name":"Humanist Democratic Centre","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanist_Democratic_Centre"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"}]}
