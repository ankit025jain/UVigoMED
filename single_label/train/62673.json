{"id":62673,"title":"Polymorphism of FCGR3A gene in sarcoidosis.","abstract":"We showed increased level of immune complexes (ICs) with mycobacterial heat shock proteins (Mtb-hsp) and increased expression of receptors for Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G (Fc?R) I-III on blood monocytes with their increased phagocytic activity, responsible for clearance of these ICs in sarcoidosis (SA). Since Fc?RIIIa is the most crucial in this process, we genotyped 77 SA patients and 143 healthy controls with polymerase chain reaction for V158F polymorphism of FCGR3A gene, encoding Fc?RIIIa. We revealed significantly higher percentage of 158F and 158FF and lower of 158FV variants in Stage I of SA versus controls. Conversely, in Stage II of SA, we found increase in 158VV homozygotes versus controls. We also showed significant increase of 158F and 158FF variants in Stage I vs II and of 158V in Stage II vs I. Therefore, in Stage I, 158F allele may cause decreased Fc?RIIIa affinity and clearance of ICs, whereas in Stage II, 158V allele may cause effective Fc?RIIIa affinity to ICs with e.g. mycobacteria, their phagocytosis, Mtb-hsp secretion with ICs formation, Mtb-hsp epitope spread and subsequent immune reaction. Thus, V158F polymorphism of FCGR3A may explain the immunocomplexemia in our patients and might serve as prognostic marker of clinical course of sarcoidosis.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530756","annotations":[{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Sarcoidosis","weight":0.884947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Phagocytosis","weight":0.872951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.822632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Fragment crystallizable region","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_crystallizable_region"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Heat shock protein","weight":0.780863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shock_protein"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.747216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.723609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Immune complex","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_complex"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.653495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Zygosity","weight":0.56779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.100692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0643303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heat shock","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shock"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
