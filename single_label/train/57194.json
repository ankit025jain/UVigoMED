{"id":57194,"title":"[Development of researches on acupuncture-assisted fertilization outside of China].","abstract":"Increasing evidence shows that acupuncture therapy may have a role in promoting fertilization. Authors of the present paper collected the related articles in English published from January 2003 to May 2013 in databases of Ovid Medline, Maternity and Infant Care and Medline (Pubmed), and made an analysis. Results of many randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT) indicated that acupuncture intervention had a positive role in raising pregnancy rate, fetus surviving rate of the transplanted embryo, and increasing the neuropeptide Y content in the ollicular fluid in patients experiencing embryo transplantation, and in raising survival rate of zygote, conception rate of embryo transplantation, and in improving azoospermia in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. But many systematic reviews and Meta-analysis did not support the above-mentioned conclusion of acupuncture therapy about promoting fertilization. The authors hold that despite of dominated positive outcomes of RCT for acupuncture-assisted fertilization, further well designed RCT are still warranted for providing further definite and convincing evidence.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25219131","annotations":[{"name":"Zygote","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygote"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.824485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.810405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Azoospermia","weight":0.540281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azoospermia"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.5241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Neuropeptide","weight":0.515136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropeptide"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.0381889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Ovid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid"},{"name":"Neuropeptide Y","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropeptide_Y"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"}]}
