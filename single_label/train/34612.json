{"id":34612,"title":"Atopic dermatitis - all you can do from the outside.","abstract":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) affects both the epidermal barrier and the immune system and, as such, therapy needs to address both. Skin cleansing supported by emollients and moisturizers is the primary topical therapy when treating patients with AD. However, it should be remembered that the direct use of emollients on inflamed skin is poorly tolerated and that the flares need to be treated effectively, usually by topical corticosteroids (TCS) and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI). This contribution outlines a number of strategies for effectively managing AD, from reactive therapy using TCS and TCI to proactive therapy. Proactive therapy is an alternative, evidence-based, immunologically founded treatment approach, based on the fact that normal-looking, nonlesional skin of patients with AD is not normal. The advantage of the proactive approach is that the patients are in control of their disease and are actively involved in its management. The avoidance of external irritants is recommended wherever possible.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720530","annotations":[{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.898264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Moisturizer","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisturizer"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.766265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Topical steroid","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_steroid"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.523648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.472668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.362079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Calcineurin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcineurin"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Proactionary principle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactionary_principle"},{"name":"Proactivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactivity"},{"name":"Tata Consultancy Services","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Consultancy_Services"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Flare (pyrotechnic)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare_(pyrotechnic)"}]}
