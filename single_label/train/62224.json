{"id":62224,"title":"Human parvovirus B19 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in Basrah.","abstract":"To investigate the association of human parvovirus B19 infection with the onset of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and its effect on TEL-AML-1 fusion gene and the presence of mutant P53.The case-control study was conducted at Basrah Hospital for Paediatrics and Gynaecology, Basrah, Iraq, from May 2009 to April 2010. A total of 100 blood samples were collected from 40 newly diagnosed cases and 60 healthy children to serve as control matched by age and gender. Human parvovirus B19-IgG and anti-P53 antibody were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and TEL-AML-1 fusion gene was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on extracted ribonucleic acid from fresh blood samples using specified primers. SPSS 15 was used for statistical analysis.A higher proportion of human parvovirus B19-positive cases was found in leukaemic patients (n=19; 47.5%) compared to 12 (20%) in the control group (p<0.05). There was significant association between TEL-AML-1 translocation and human parvovirus-B19 infection as 10 (71.4%) of TEL-AML-1 translocation-positive cases had human parvovirus-B19 IgG. On the other hand, there was no association between such infections and P53 gene mutation in the patients.Human parvovirus-B19 infection is common in the population, with higher prevalence among leukaemic patients with significant association between human parvovirus-B19 and TEL-AML-1 fusion gene in patients of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605704","annotations":[{"name":"P53","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Fusion gene","weight":0.848396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_gene"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.734939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.6415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.632587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.55351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.548236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.411563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Iraq","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Parvovirus B19","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvovirus_B19"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.237658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Parvovirus","weight":0.216946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvovirus"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.195799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.150999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Basra","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basra"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"}]}
