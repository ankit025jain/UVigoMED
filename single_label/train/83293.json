{"id":83293,"title":"Outcomes of nonelective weekend admissions for lower extremity ischemia.","abstract":"A \"weekend effect\" has been demonstrated for a number of diagnoses, including many cardiovascular pathologies. Whether patients with lower extremity ischemia admitted over the weekend have inferior outcomes compared with those admitted on a weekday is unknown.Nonelective admissions for critical limb ischemia (CLI) and acute limb ischemia (ALI) from lower extremity thrombosis or embolism were identified in the 2005 to 2010 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, and outcomes were compared based on weekend vs weekday admission by using multiple logistic and linear regression.Of the 63,768 patients identified with lower extremity vascular emergencies, 15.4% were admitted during the weekend. Patients admitted on the weekend were less likely to have CLI than those admitted on a weekday (51.2% vs 65.4%; P < .001) and were more likely to have ALI than patients admitted during a weekday (48.8% vs 34.5%; P < .001). Weekend admission was independently associated with a lower likelihood of revascularization (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.95; P < .001), a longer time until revascularization (3.09 days vs 2.75 days; P < .001), an increased likelihood of major amputation (aOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.19-1.53; P < .001), in-hospital complications (aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.25; P < .001), and discharge to a skilled nursing facility (aOR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.25; P = .001), and a longer predicted length of stay (10.1 days vs 9.5 days; P < .001). There was no statistically significant association between weekend admission and in-hospital mortality (aOR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.25; P = .10).Patients admitted on the weekend for lower extremity vascular emergencies are significantly more likely to experience adverse outcomes, including major amputation, than patients admitted on a weekday, independent of their presenting diagnosis with ALI or CLI. Further investigation into the etiologies of these differences is needed to address this disparity. These data raise questions about the proper staffing models to optimize urgent treatment of lower extremity vascular emergencies.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs
