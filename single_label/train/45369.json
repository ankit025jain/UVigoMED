{"id":45369,"title":"High rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis in patients undergoing endoscopic treatment of benign biliary stricture.","abstract":"Endoscopic treatment is the best option for patients with postsurgical stricture of main biliary duct. There is scarce information about the incidence of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) complications in this condition. The aim was to evaluate the incidence of complications and the associated risk factors in patients undergoing ERCP for postcholecystectomy biliary stricture.Prospective analysis of patients with postsurgical stenosis of main biliary duct was carried out. Rate of post-ERCP complications was determined and the associated risk factors were analyzed.A total of 25 patients were included. The success rate of endoscopic treatment was 92% (n=23). Two patients had recurrence of stricture with median follow-up of 23 months (range, 0.3 to 65.4 mo). Five patients (20%) developed acute pancreatitis after ERCP. No risk factors were detected in multivariate analysis.Incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis is high in patients with biliary stricture associated with surgical procedures.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686353","annotations":[{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.908618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.817745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.350122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute pancreatitis","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
