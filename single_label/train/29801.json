{"id":29801,"title":"Differences in trait mindfulness across mental health symptoms among adults in substance use treatment.","abstract":"Mindfulness is a growing area of investigation among individuals manifesting substance use disorders, as mindfulness meditation may help to prevent relapse to substance use. The current study examined levels of trait mindfulness in substance users seeking treatment from May 2012 to August 2012 in a Tennessee residential center and whether patients with probable (i.e., diagnoses based on a self-report screening instrument) comorbid depression or PTSD reported lower mindfulness than patients without a probable comorbid diagnosis. Data were collected from a convenience sample of archival patient records (N = 125) and four instruments. The majority of patients were male (n = 84) and non-Hispanic Caucasian (92%); the mean age of the sample was 37.36 (SD = 12.47). Results showed that lower trait mindfulness was associated with increased levels of substance use, depression, and PTSD. Patients with a probable depression or PTSD diagnosis reported lower mindfulness than patients without these disorders. Patients with probable comorbid depression and PTSD reported the lowest levels of mindfulness. These findings suggest that altering levels of mindfulness may be important for individuals manifesting dual-diagnoses in substance user treatment. The study's limitations are noted.
