{"id":88115,"title":"Postural complexity influences development in infants born preterm with brain injury: relating perception-action theory to 3 cases.","abstract":"Perception-action theory suggests a cyclical relationship between movement and perceptual information. In this case series, changes in postural complexity were used to quantify an infant's action and perception during the development of early motor behaviors.Three infants born preterm with periventricular white matter injury were included.Longitudinal changes in postural complexity (approximate entropy of the center of pressure), head control, reaching, and global development, measured with the Test of Infant Motor Performance and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, were assessed every 0.5 to 3 months during the first year of life. All 3 infants demonstrated altered postural complexity and developmental delays. However, the timing of the altered postural complexity and the type of delays varied among the infants. For infant 1, reduced postural complexity or limited action while learning to control her head in the midline position may have contributed to her motor delay. However, her ability to adapt her postural complexity eventually may have supported her ability to learn from her environment, as reflected in her relative cognitive strength. For infant 2, limited early postural complexity may have negatively affected his learning through action, resulting in cognitive delay. For infant 3, an increase in postural complexity above typical levels was associated with declining neurological status.Postural complexity is proposed as a measure of perception and action in the postural control system during the development of early behaviors. An optimal, intermediate level of postural complexity supports the use of a variety of postural control strategies and enhances the perception-action cycle. Either excessive or reduced postural complexity may contribute to developmental delays in infants born preterm with white matter injury.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903116","annotations":[{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Entropy","weight":0.741285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.661254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.649851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.603184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.439646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.414804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Developmental disability","weight":0.277566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.222846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.181281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.149105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"White matter","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.113791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Control system","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Toddler","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Ventricular system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system"},{"name":"Quantity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"White noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Action theory (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_theory_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Motor system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_system"}]}
