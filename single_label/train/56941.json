{"id":56941,"title":"1. Vaginal breech birth--the phoenix arising from the ashes.","abstract":"Vaginal breech birth all but disappeared from UK maternity units after the publication of the Term Breech Trial (Hannah et al 2000). However, mounting evidence does not support caesarean section as the safest mode of birth for the baby or the mother when the baby is presenting breech. But the intervening years have depleted the attending professional's skills. We describe our personal journey to regaining them, learning better ones and introducing safe choice for women. This article is the first in a series which examines the practice and evidence base for the care of women and babies aspiring to experience a safe breech birth.","date":"2014-10-20","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25326964","annotations":[{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.440988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.423583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Breech birth","weight":0.316968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breech_birth"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0492993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Maternity","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0332009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"},{"name":"Phoenix (mythology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology)"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Jim Breech","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Breech"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Cremation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cremation"}]}
