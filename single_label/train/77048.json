{"id":77048,"title":"Usefulness of hyponatremia as a predictor for adverse events in patients with heart failure receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy.","abstract":"Hyponatremia portends a poor prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF). The aim of this study was to evaluate prognostic implication of hyponatremia on adverse events in patients with HF receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Additionally, the impact of improvement of hyponatremia after CRT device implantation was also evaluated. In this retrospective analysis, we included patients in whom a CRT device was implanted between April 2004 and April 2010 at our institution and had a baseline sodium level obtained within 72 hours of implantation. The patients were followed up for 3 years after implantation for subsequent primary composite end points, that is, hospitalization for HF, left ventricular assist device or heart transplant, and all-cause death. Sodium levels were followed up at 3 to 6 months after device implantation. Hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium level of <135 mmol/L. A total of 402 patients were included (age 68.7 ± 12.3 years, women 20.9%). One hundred seventy-nine adverse events were noted in this period. In a Cox proportional hazards univariate model, hyponatremia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.113 to 2.131, p = 0.009), creatinine (HR 1.267, 95% CI 1.156 to 1.389, p <0.001), and diuretics (HR 2.652, 95% CI 1.401 to 5.019, p = 0.003) were associated with occurrence of the composite end point. A total of 57.9% of patients with hyponatremia at baseline had the composite end point compared with 40.7% of those with normal sodium concentration (p = 0.004). Kaplan-Meier curve showed that hyponatremic patients fared worse. Also, patients in whom hyponatremia resolved after CRT device implantation had lower incidence of the composite end point compared with patients who had normal pre-CRT sodium levels but developed hyponatremia later. In conclusion, baseline hyponatremia is associated with poor prognosis in patients with HF. CRT can resolve hyponatremia in some patients after device implantation. Patients with postimplantation hyponatremia (either newly developed or persistent from baseline) have a poor clinical outcome. Post-CRT improvement of hyponatremia is associated with improved clinical outcomes.
