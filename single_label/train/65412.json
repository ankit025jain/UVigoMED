{"id":65412,"title":"[Prognostic significance of mutually exclusive expression of ERG and SPINK1 in endocrine-treated prostatic cancer].","abstract":"To study the expression and prognostic significance of ERG and SPINK1 expression in endocrine-treated prostatic cancer.Prostatic needle biopsies from 118 prostatic cancer patients primarily treated with endocrine therapy were reviewed. Immunohistochemical study for ERG and SPINK1 protein was carried out.Co-expression of ERG and SPINK1 was not observed. The frequency of ERG protein expression in the 118 biopsies studied was 9.3% (11/118). The positive expression correlated with T stage (P=0.04) but not with patient age at diagnosis, prostatic specific antigen level, Gleason's score, M stage, tumor area and progression-free survival. Positive expression of SPINK1 was demonstrated in 11.0% (13/118) of the biopsies. SPINK1-positive cases carried a significantly shorter progression-free survival, as compared with SPINK1-negative cases (P=0.022). The expression was not associated with any other clinicopathologic variables. The following expression pattern showed statistically significant correlation with the clinical progress (P=0.029): ERG+/SPINK1- (11/118, 9.3%), ERG-/SPINK1+ (13/118, 11.0%) and ERG-/SPINK1- (94/118, 79.7%).ERG and SPINK1 proteins are mutually exclusive.SPINK1 expression is associated with more aggressive clinical behavior and can serve as a prognostic biomarker in prostatic cancer.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842011","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.817003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.727312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.657951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.520423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.460249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.430164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.27983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.250134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Electroretinography","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroretinography"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Mutually exclusive events","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_exclusive_events"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
