{"id":59216,"title":"Quality of life (QOL) in women treated for gynecologic malignancies with radiation therapy: a literature review of patient-reported outcomes.","abstract":"To summarize the literature on quality of life for patients treated with definitive radiation for gynecologic cancers, with a specific focus on patient reported outcomes.A literature review was performed to summarize studies about patient-reported outcomes and quality of life in women with gynecologic malignancies who were treated with definitive radiation therapy. Summaries are by disease site, including endometrial, cervical and vulvar cancers.Over 20 different survey instruments have been used to describe patient-reported outcomes for women treated with radiation for gynecologic cancer. Regardless of disease site, all patients describe a degree of compromise in physical and social functioning, as well as sexual dysfunction. Specific symptoms which are most bothersome for patients vary by disease site, such as bowel concerns predominating for endometrial cancer patients, while body image is more concerning for cervical cancer patients.Several quality of life concerns exist for women treated with radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies. Significant overlap exists in the QOL issues affecting these patients. Whether to combine or separate surveys by diagnosis, treatment type, age, or time point should be explored further. Assessing patients' psychological, emotional, and physical concerns helps to understand long-term adjustment, enabling incorporation of these domains into future trials that will ultimately improve patient well-being.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844593","annotations":[{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Body image","weight":0.619924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.615256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.559993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.226985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Gynecologic oncology","weight":0.163605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecologic_oncology"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Vulvar cancer","weight":0.0522101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulvar_cancer"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.0389124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Patient-reported outcome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient-reported_outcome"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
