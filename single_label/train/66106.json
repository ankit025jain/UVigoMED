{"id":66106,"title":"Genetic polymorphisms of ORAI1 and chronic kidney disease in Taiwanese population.","abstract":"Taiwan has very high incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which easily progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The association between inflammation and CKD has been explored in several studies. ORAI1 functions as a pore-forming subunit of the store-operated calcium channels which are involved in the regulation of immune system. Hence, we conducted a case-control study to determine whether the genetic polymorphisms of ORAI1 gene is a susceptibility factor to CKD and its clinical features in a Taiwanese population. Five hundred seventy-nine CKD patients from a hospital-based CKD care program were included in the study. Five tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of ORAI1 were selected from the genotyping data of the Han Chinese population from the HapMap project. Among these polymorphisms, rs12313273 was found to be significantly associated with elevated serum calcium levels, which has been linked to increased risk of death in CKD patients. To have a better management of serum calcium, we suggest that ORAI1 polymorphisms might be used as a potential biomarker for initiating non-calcium-based phosphate binder in CKD patients in the future.
