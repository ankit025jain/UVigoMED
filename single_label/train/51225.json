{"id":51225,"title":"Evaluation of genetic biomarkers for distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid neoplasms.","abstract":"Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) aids in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules. The expression of previously implicated genes was examined to potentially discriminate between benign and malignant thyroid samples.Patients included for study had cytology demonstrating follicular cells of undetermined significance, atypical cells of undetermined significance, follicular neoplasm, or suspicion of malignancy with one of the following postoperative diagnoses: follicular thyroid adenomas, follicular thyroid carcinomas, or follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas (FV-PTCs). FNA and tumor expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), high-mobility group A2 (HMGA2), and trefoil factor 3/3-galactoside-binding lectin (T/G ratio) were analyzed.T/G ratios were not significantly different in the malignant and benign groups. HMGA2 was overexpressed in carcinoma states; however, only FV-PTCs were significant (P = .006). Tumor hTERT expression was detected in 25% of follicular thyroid carcinomas, whereas 5% of FV-PTCs and 10% of follicular thyroid adenomas had expression. FNA aspirates showed similar results.Although HMGA2 and hTERT showed differential expression, they did not consistently differentiate benign from malignant. Further study based on global gene expression is needed to identify markers that could serve as a diagnostic tool.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713092","annotations":[{"name":"Telomerase","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.868908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Lectin","weight":0.775346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectin"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.697734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.492493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Follicular cell","weight":0.461579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_cell"},{"name":"Reverse transcriptase","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.262357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Follicular lymphoma","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_lymphoma"},{"name":"Thyroid neoplasm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_neoplasm"},{"name":"Telomerase reverse transcriptase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase_reverse_transcriptase"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Thyroid nodule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_nodule"}]}
