{"id":81200,"title":"Vestibular unit transplantation in the coverage of gingival recession: a microsurgical approach.","abstract":"The palate, maxillary tuberosity and edentulous ridges are generally used as the donor sites for connective tissue grafts. This article shows the use of vestibular soft tissue of a tooth in the coverage of localized gingival recession. The vestibular unit was harvested during crown lengthening procedures, sutured over the denuded root surface, and covered with a coronally advanced flap without vertical incisions. The healing was uneventful with complete coverage of the recession up to 18 months. The vestibular unit of a tooth can serve as the donor area for a connective tissue graft in the coverage of gingival recessions, resulting in stable outcomes.
