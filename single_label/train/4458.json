{"id":4458,"title":"[Effect of C60 fullerene on viscoelastic properties of human erythrocytes membrane].","abstract":"The effect of C60 fullerene aqueous colloid solution (C60FAS) on viscoelastic properties of human erythrocytes membrane has been studied. It was established that the effect of C60FAS on erythrocytes depends on the medium osmolality and concentration of C60 fullerene in it. In particular, in isotonic solution (0,15 mol/l NaCl) adding C60 fullerene in concentrations from 0,7 to 28 ?mol/l did not cause the hemolytic damage of cells. In hypotonic medium when introducing C60 fullerene (7 ?mol/l concentration) at the beginning of erythrocyte hemolysis its stimulating effect was maximal and when adding C60FAS in 20 s after hemolysis start no this process stimulation is observed. This points to the changes in viscoelastic properties of erythrocyte membranes even during the first seconds of its interaction with C60 fullerene.","date":"2015-01-08","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25566674","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.805127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Colloid","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid"},{"name":"Tonicity","weight":0.744119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Sodium chloride","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"},{"name":"Fullerene","weight":0.707117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullerene"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Osmolarity","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmolarity"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Viscoelasticity","weight":0.485512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscoelasticity"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Buckminsterfullerene","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminsterfullerene"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Gun moll","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_moll"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Chemical interaction","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_interaction"},{"name":"C.D.
