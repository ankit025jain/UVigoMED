{"id":1502,"title":"Using spiritually modified cognitive-behavioral therapy in substance dependence treatment: therapists' and clients' perceptions of the presumed benefits and limitations.","abstract":"Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that has been modified to incorporate clients' spiritual beliefs and practices has been used to treat a variety of problems. This study examines the utility of this modality with the treatment of alcohol dependence and other forms of substance abuse. Toward this end, six focus groups (three therapist groups and three client groups) were conducted to identify the presumed benefits and limitations of using spiritually modified CBT in substance dependence treatment. In terms of benefits, spiritually modified CBT was perceived to enhance outcomes through operationalizing horizontal and vertical sources of social support, divine coping resources, and spiritual motivation. Potential challenges include the risk of therapists inadvertently imposing their own beliefs during the modification process and the possibility of offending clients when conflicts in belief systems emerge, particularly in group setting. The article concludes by providing suggestions for incorporating spiritually modified CBT into treatment and develops a number of illustrative examples of spiritually modified CBT self-statements.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25369720","annotations":[{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Religion","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.708844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Spirituality","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Belief","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.507012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.49308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.425366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"World view","weight":0.376917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_view"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.293174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Divinity","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Consumer/Survivor/Ex-Patient Movement","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer/Survivor/Ex-Patient_Movement"},{"name":"Alcohol dependence","weight":0.0540607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dependence"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Operational definition","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition"},{"name":"Potential","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Mod (video gaming)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(video_gaming)"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Focus group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group"},{"name":"Customer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer"}]}
