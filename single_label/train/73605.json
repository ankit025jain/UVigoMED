{"id":73605,"title":"Epithelioid glioblastoma arising from pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with the BRAF V600E mutation.","abstract":"Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is classified by the World Health Organization as a grade II astrocytic tumor with relatively favorable prognosis among gliomas. A valine-to-glutamic acid substitution at position 600 of the serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF (BRAF V600E) mutation, which is commonly found in PXA, has recently been detected in approximately 50% of all epithelioid glioblastoma (GBM) cases. We herein report a case of epithelioid GBM developing at the site of a left temporal PXA 13 years after the treatment of the primary tumor. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in both tumors. These findings suggest that epithelioid GBM may arise from a PXA with a BRAF V600E mutation.","date":"2014-07-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24894018","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Pleomorphism","weight":0.835292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphism"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.819321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.714481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Astrocyte","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.344178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.14503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.053079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"XScale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XScale"}]}
