{"id":23936,"title":"Serial quantification of procalcitonin (PCT) predicts clinical outcome and prognosis in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).","abstract":"Procalcitonin (PCT), a calcitonin precursor, is commonly measured in the setting of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, the clinical significance of serial PCT changes has not been established. We conducted a prospective observational study of 122 patients with CAP. Thirty-day mortality was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included: (1) initial treatment failure, (2) 30-day mortality and/or initial treatment failure, and (3) intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In subgroup analysis, we classified patients into pneumococcal pneumonia and non-pneumococcal pneumonia groups. The baseline frequency of 30-day mortality was 10.7%. Increases in serum PCT levels from admission to Day 3 were observed with statistically higher frequency in patients with 30-day mortality (P = 0.002). For secondary endpoints, only the 30-day mortality and/or initial treatment failure group was statistically significant (P = 0.007). Subgroup analysis revealed statistically significant changes in the non-pneumococcal pneumonia group (N = 85) across several endpoints, including 30-day mortality (P = 0.001), initial treatment failure (P = 0.013), and 30-day mortality and/or initial treatment failure (P < 0.001). No significant changes in endpoint measurements were found in the pneumococcal pneumonia group (N = 28). Interestingly, serum PCT levels at the time of diagnosis were higher in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia than those with non-pneumococcal pneumonia (P = 0.006), and this positively correlated with disease severity scores for all patients (PCT vs. PSI: R = 0.380, P < 0.001; PCT vs.R = 0.422, P < 0.001) and for non-pneumococcal pneumonia (PCT vs. PSI: R = 0.468, P < 0.001; PCT vs.R = 0.448, P < 0.001), but not for pneumococcal pneumonia. In conclusion, serial quantification of PCT can predict clinical outcomes for patients with CAP.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462441","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.585576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.548787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.520338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.429832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.411358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.330487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.286252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.133002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.119542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Calcitonin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitonin"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"London Buses route N28","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Buses_route_N28"},{"name":"N85 road (Ireland)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N85_road_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Bacterial pneumonia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_pneumonia"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"380","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/380"},{"name":"448","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/448"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Group N","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_N"},{"name":"24 (season 3)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(season_3)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"End point of clinical trials","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_point_of_clinical_trials"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"}]}
