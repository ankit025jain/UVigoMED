{"id":86879,"title":"[Study on serological cross-reactivity of six pathogenic phleboviruses].","abstract":"This article aimed to study the antigenicity of nucleocapsid proteins (NPs) in six pathogenic phleboviruses and to provide theoretical evidence for the development of serological diagnostic reagents. NPs of six pathogenic phleboviruses were expressed and purified using a prokaryotic expression system and rabbits were immunized with individual recombinant NPs. Cross-reactions among NPs and rabbit sera were determined by both indirect ELISA and Western blotting analyses, and the sera titer was determined by indirect ELISA. Furthermore, sera from SFTS patients were also detected by each recombinant NP as a coating antigen using indirect ELISA. The cross-reactions and the sera titer were subsequently determined. Both the concentration and purity of recombinant NPs of six pathogenic phleboviruses met the standards for immunization and detection. The results of indirect ELISA and Western blotting showed that each anti-phlebovirus NP rabbit immune serum had potential serological cross-reactivity with the other five virus NP antigens. Furthermore, the sera from SFTS patients also had cross-reactivity with the other five NP antigens to a certain extent. Our preliminary study evaluated the antigenicity and immune reactivity of six pathogenic phleboviruses NPs and laid the foundation for the development of diagnostic reagents.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272591","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Prokaryote","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.654701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.621785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.620691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.424505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Nucleocapsid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleocapsid"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Antigenicity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenicity"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Protein purification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_purification"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
