{"id":43281,"title":"The protective effect of apelin against water-immersion and restraint stress-induced gastric damage.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the gastroprotective effect of apelin on water-immersion and restraint stress (WIRS)-induced gastric lesions. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, WIRS, F13A + WIRS and F13A. APJ receptor antagonist F13A was administered to rats to determine the influence of apelin on stress-induced gastric injury. WIRS administered for 6 h resulted in the development of gastric mucosal lesions accompanied by a significant increase in plasma corticosterone. WIRS increased the concentration of 4-hydroxynonenol (4-HNE) + malondialdehyde (MDA) and the expression of apelin and hypoxia inducible factor-1? (HIF-1?) in gastric mucosa. In addition, WIRS reduced the mucosal blood flow and gastric prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) concentration. Plasma corticosterone, which was increased due to stress, was significantly decreased in the F13A + WIRS group. Gastric lesions and the 4-HNE + MDA concentration were also higher in the F13A + WIRS compared to the WIRS group. We conclude that apelin has a gastroprotective effect against stress-induced lesions possibly by reducing lipid peroxidation in gastric mucosa.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798037","annotations":[{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.816916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.759622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.723532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E2","weight":0.551464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E2"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.501239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Corticosterone","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosterone"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.295353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Hypoxia-inducible factors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Apelin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apelin"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E"},{"name":"Gastric mucosa","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_mucosa"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Mazda Wankel engine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_Wankel_engine"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"},{"name":"LSWR F13 class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSWR_F13_class"},{"name":"Helsingborgs IF","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsingborgs_IF"}]}
