{"id":23151,"title":"[Treatment and prophylaxis of infectious complications in hepatobiliary surgery].","abstract":"The results of application of the antibacterial chinolone preparation maxicine in hepatobiliary surgery and gynecology in 28 patients were analyzed. In 6 patients the preparation was applied after reconstructive operations on biliary tructs (high hepaticojejunostomy for cicatricial stricture of biliary ducts), in 22--after laparoscopic operations (cholecystectomy, choledocholithotomy, excision of suppurated ovarian cysts). The spectrum of causative agents was presented. There was proved a high efficacy of the preparation for prophylaxis and treatment of the diseases and postoperative complications after interventions on the hepatobiliary zone organs and the ovarian cystic affection.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501959","annotations":[{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.858148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.61497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.601877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.592859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Ovarian cyst","weight":0.373483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cyst"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.26538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Hepatobiliary system","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatobiliary_system"},{"name":"Affection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"}]}
