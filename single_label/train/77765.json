{"id":77765,"title":"[A comparison of 226 Hz and 1 000 Hz tympanometry in diagnosis of infants otitis media effusion].","abstract":"To provide a clinical reference by comparing the conventional 226 Hz tympanometry with 1000 Hz tympanometry in two groups of young children with otitis media effusion evidenced by CT scan.One hundred and seventy-seven young children (226 ears), from 1 to 60 months, with otitis media effusion were involved in this study. They were divided into six groups by age: 0-6 months group, 6-12 months group, 12-18 months group, 18-24 months group, 24-36 months group, 36-60 months group. They were tested with tympanometry of 2 probe-tones of 226 and 1 000 Hz. Type A tympanogram was defined as a normal middle ear function in 226 Hz and single-or double-peak in 1 000 Hz tympanometry. One hundred and fifty-eight normal young children (266 ears) were selected as control group. The results were analysed with Chi square test. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the two methods.In the young children with otitis media effusion, the detection rate of 226 Hz tympanogram in six groups was 21.1%, 35.2%, 46.9%, 42%, 62.5% and 68% respectively, while 94.7%, 98.1%, 96.9%, 91.2%, 95.8% and 88% respectively in 1 000 Hz tympanogram. In the young children with normal middle ear function, the detection rate of 226 Hz tympanogram in six groups was 95.1%, 88.6%, 85.1%, 93.3%, 88.5% and 93.5%, while 87.8%, 94.3%, 89.4%, 95.6%, 94.2% and 97.8% respectively in 1 000 Hz tympanogram. The detection rate was significantly different between 226 and 1 000 Hz tympanogram in the young children under 36-month old.A single-or double-peak 1000 Hz tympanometric patterns as normal criteria was a simple way to evaluate young children s' middle ear function. 1 000 Hz tympanometry should be given priority to the children within 36-month old in detection middle ear function,the 226 and 1 000 Hz tympanometry should be done at the same time within 36-60 months old.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25129969","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.800801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.358263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.21044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.182246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Chi-square test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_test"},{"name":"Tympanometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanometry"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"1824","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1824"},{"name":"1218","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1218"},{"name":"266","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/266"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"226","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/226"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Square (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(geometry)"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}]}
