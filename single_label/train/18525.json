{"id":18525,"title":"The risk of surgical site infection and re-admission in obese patients undergoing total joint replacement who lose weight before surgery and keep it off post-operatively.","abstract":"This study evaluated whether obese patients who lost weight before their total joint replacement and kept it off post-operatively were at lower risk of surgical site infection (SSI) and re-admission compared with those who remained the same weight. We reviewed 444 patients who underwent a total hip replacement and 937 with a total knee replacement who lost weight pre-operatively and sustained their weight loss after surgery. After adjustments, patients who lost weight before a total hip replacement and kept it off post-operatively had a 3.77 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59 to 8.95) greater likelihood of deep SSIs and those who lost weight before a total knee replacement had a 1.63 (95% CI 1.16 to 2.28) greater likelihood of re-admission compared with the reference group. These findings raise questions about the safety of weight management before total replacement of the hip and knee joints.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788497","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Joint replacement","weight":0.690137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_replacement"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.662366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.584953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.574321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.560502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.492341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.250089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.173912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Reference group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_group"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"937","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/937"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Keep","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Weight management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_management"}]}
