{"id":36875,"title":"Aortic valve-sparing in aortic dissection with transposition of great arteries.","abstract":"Patients with transposition of the great arteries have good survival after surgery, but some have complications ranging from heart failure to valve dysfunction. A 42-year-old woman who underwent surgical correction in childhood, presented with aortic dissection and had a valve-sparing root operation, but died immediately postoperatively. Both aortic dissection and valve-sparing root operations in this setting have not been described before. This case highlights facts to consider in the treatment of this presentation.
