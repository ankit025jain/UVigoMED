{"id":59396,"title":"State and trait anxiety as a psychopathological phenomenon correlated with postpartum depression in a Romanian sample: a pilot study.","abstract":"The current study aimed to investigate the rate of postpartum depression and its correlation with both state and trait anxiety. A cross-sectional study was performed on 80 mothers monitored in the Ambulatory of \"Bega\" Obstetrics Clinic from Timisoara. The presence of depression was assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, using a cut-off ? 10. State anxiety was assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory and anchored visual analogue scales. Trait anxiety was dimensionally assessed using the Karolinska Scale of Personality (KSP). More than half of recruited mothers presented a global score significant for postpartum depression (N = 43, 53.8%). Both perspectives of anxiety, as a state (p < 0.001) and as personality traits (e.g. p = 0.003 for psychic anxiety), were significantly correlated with postpartum depression. Furthermore, the levels of worry related to self-perceived health status of both mother and infant were significant in mothers with postpartum depression. We can conclude that postpartum depression was a highly-frequent psychopathological phenomenon among mothers from this sample set. In addition, both state and trait anxiety were common co-occurring clinical features.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824599","annotations":[{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.799132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.741331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Psychic","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.631971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Psychopathology","weight":0.614434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathology"},{"name":"Personality psychology","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.398019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Trait theory","weight":0.36342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_theory"},{"name":"Postpartum depression","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.286427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Edinburgh","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.118004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Karolinska Institutet","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karolinska_Institutet"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Beck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Romanian language","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language"},{"name":"Psychological resistance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resistance"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Analogy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
