{"id":81760,"title":"Multiple simple bone cysts of the jaws: review of the literature and report of three cases.","abstract":"This study contributes three well-documented cases of multiple simple bone cysts (SBCs) of the jaws and reviews previously published cases.A comprehensive literature search of multiple SBCs was conducted using the PubMed database. Synonyms of SBC were used as search key words in combination with \"mandible or jaw,\" \"bilateral, multiple, multifocal, atypical, and unusual.\"A total of 34 cases of multiple SBCs (including two asynchronous cases) were identified, including the three new cases reported here. Multiple SBCs primarily occurred in the second decade (52.9%) and bilaterally in the posterior mandible. Lesions demonstrated female predominance (1.8:1) and were frequently accompanied by bony expansion (44.1%) and a multilocular radiolucent appearance (20.6 %). Recurrence was reported in three patients (mean age: 39.3 years old).Knowledge of the clinical and radiographic features of multiple SBCs is important in the diagnosis and management of this entity.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842451","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.486376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.324282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.256906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.25589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.254482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.229542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Synonym","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Bone cyst","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_cyst"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Keyword (linguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_(linguistics)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Unique key","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_key"},{"name":"AT&T","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T"},{"name":"44,100 Hz","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/44,100_Hz"},{"name":"Anatomical position","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_position"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Asynchrony","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony"},{"name":"Single-board computer","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer"}]}
