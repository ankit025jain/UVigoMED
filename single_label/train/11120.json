{"id":11120,"title":"Dilated cardiomyopathy in a De Brazza's monkey (Cercopithecus neglectus).","abstract":"Cardiomyopathies have been reported in many primates. They may result from an inflammatory response to an infectious agent, nutritional deficiency, familial-genetic inheritance or toxic agents, but in many cases they are idiopathic.A De Brazza's monkey (Cercopithecus neglectus) presented with weight loss and inappetence. Physical examination, blood collection and diagnostic imaging and an electrocardiogram were performed.Radiographs and echocardiogram revealed pleural effusion with partially collapsed lungs, cardiomegaly, and reduced myocardial contractility from myocardial failure.Necropsy revealed pulmonary infarction, subsequent to heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611814","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Dilated cardiomyopathy","weight":0.866597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilated_cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.728081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Cardiomegaly","weight":0.668451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomegaly"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.664119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.538854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.528221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Contractility","weight":0.412137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractility"},{"name":"Nutrition disorder","weight":0.361745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition_disorder"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.223263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"}]}
