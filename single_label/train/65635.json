{"id":65635,"title":"Face and content validation of the prostatic hyperplasia model and holmium laser surgery simulator.","abstract":"Although a number of simulators have been introduced for prostate surgery, none have undergone validation for holmium laser enucleation of the prostate training. This study was carried out to assess the face and content validities as well as feasibility and acceptability of the new prostatic hyperplasia model and prostate surgery simulator for holmium laser enucleation of the prostate.This is a prospective, observational, and comparative study. Participants were given a 30-minute video tutorial followed by a 45-minute simulation session, with one-to-one mentoring. A survey with qualitative and quantitative fields was used to evaluate their experience.This study was carried out in a 2-day modular teaching course hosted by the Holmium User Group at Cambridge University Hospitals, UK, and during the British Association of Urological Surgeons 2013 Annual Meeting.A total of 36 participants comprising 13 urology trainees and 23 senior urologists of varying levels from all around the globe were recruited.Overall, 87% of the participants believed that holmium laser enucleation of the prostate was an effective method of treatment, simulation-based training, and assessment essential for patient safety and 84% believed a validated simulator would be useful for training. Of the participants, 97% agreed that the simulation should be implemented into training programs and only 31% felt it should be part of accreditation. Participants ranked all components of the simulator greater than 7 of 10 on a global rating scale and believed it was a feasible and acceptable method of training and assessment.The new simulator for holmium laser enucleation of the prostate has been demonstrated to be useful as a training tool. This study has established face and content validities of the simulator. Senior and trainee urologists believed the simulator was an acceptable tool for training and assessment and its use feasible for novice trainees to acquire skills and knowledge to a predetermined level of proficiency.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Male Urogenital
