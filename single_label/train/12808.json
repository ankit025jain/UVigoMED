{"id":12808,"title":"Should preconditioning hyperbaric oxygenation protect the liver against ischemia-reperfusion injury? An experimental study in a rat model.","abstract":"We designed studies to test the hypotheses that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy should protect liver against subsequent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury are scarce and controversial. The purpose of this study was to clarify some questions about the association of HBO with the processes of liver I/R.We divided Wistar rats into 5 groups: (1) SHAM operation, (2) I/R, rats submitted to total pedicle ischemia for 30 minutes followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion; (3) HBO60I/R and (4) HBO120I/R, rats respectively submitted to 60 and 120 minutes of HBO therapy at 2 absolute atmospheres and immediately after submitted to the experimental protocol of I/R; (5) HBO120, rats submitted to 120 minutes of HBO therapy at 2 absolute atmospheres and then immediately after humanely killed. The experimental protocol included (1) serum levels of aspartate and alanine aminotransferase; (2) mitochondrial function; (3) tissue malondialdehyde (MDA); and (4) plasma nitrite/nitrate. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test and were considered significant P < 5%.The processes of liver ischemia/reperfusion caused tissue injury with hepatic mitochondrial functional impairment. A single exposure to 120 minutes of HBO caused an increase of tissue MDA. The time of HBO exposure as preconditioning before hepatic I/R is critical in the prevalence of beneficial or deleterious effects. Sixty minutes of hyperoxic preconditioning before liver I/R presents systemic benefits, but no significant tissue preservation. One hundred twenty minutes of hyperoxic preconditioning tissue liver benefits predominate compared with systemic benefits.The HBO preconditioning therapeutic benefits to liver I/R injury are time dependent, suggesting a therapeutic window that needs to be clearly defined in future studies.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507026","annotations":[{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.82664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.71367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Hyperbaric medicine","weight":0.583827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.534913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.490293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.331581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.312335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Hyperoxia","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoxia"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Atmosphere (unit)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.110686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"HBO","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO"},{"name":"Therapeutic window","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_window"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Protocol (natural sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(natural_sciences)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
