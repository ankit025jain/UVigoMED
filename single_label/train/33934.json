{"id":33934,"title":"Low fasting plasma glucose level predicts morbidity and mortality in symptomatic adults with congenital heart disease.","abstract":"Adults with complex congenital heart disease (ACHD) have a high prevalence of abnormal glucose regulation (AGR: impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus). However, the impact of AGR on the prognosis remains unclear.Our purpose was to clarify the prognostic value of AGR in ACHD.We performed a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test in 438 consecutive patients with ACHD (age 26 Â± 8 years), including 38 unrepaired, 148 Fontan, 252 biventricular, and 27 healthy subjects and investigated associations between AGR and clinical events that required hospitalization or caused deaths from all-causes. When compared with the healthy group, fasting blood glucose level (FPG, mg/dl) was lower in the unrepaired and Fontan subjects (p<0.05-0.01) and the prevalence of low FPG (? 80 mg/dl) was also higher in the unrepaired (58%), Fontan (47%), and biventricular group (33%) than in the healthy control (11%) (p<0.0001). Postprandial hyperglycemia (area under the curve of glucose: PG-AUC) was higher in all ACHD groups (p<0.0001 for all). New York Heart Association class and lower FPG independently predicted the hospitalization (FPG ? 84 mg/dl) and mortality (FPG ? 80 mg/dl) (p<0.05-0.0001), while the PG-AUC was not an independent predictor. When compared with the asymptomatic ACHD, symptomatic ACHD with lower FPG had high hazard ratios of 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-3.8, p<0.002) and 3.3 (95% CI: 1.2-11.9, p<0.03) for the hospitalizations and all-cause mortality, respectively.Low FPG is not uncommon in ACHD and the low FPG predicts the morbidity and all-cause mortality in symptomatic ACHD.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780541","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.935129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.736555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.719848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.699312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.665384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.579314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.55398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"York","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"New York Heart Association Functional Classification","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Heart_Association_Functional_Classification"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
