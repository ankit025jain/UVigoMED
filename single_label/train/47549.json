{"id":47549,"title":"Mortality, liver transplantation, and hepatocellular carcinoma among patients with chronic hepatitis B treated with entecavir vs lamivudine.","abstract":"Little is known about whether the antiviral agent entecavir is more effective than a less potent drug, lamivudine, in reducing the risk of death and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B.We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 5374 consecutive adult patients with chronic hepatitis B, treated with entecavir (n = 2000) or lamivudine (n = 3374), at a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, Korea, from November 1, 1999, through December 31, 2011. Data were collected from patients for up to 6 years and analyzed by a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for the entire cohort and for propensity score-matched cohorts.During the study period, 302 patients (5.6%) died, 169 (3.1%) received a liver transplant, and 525 (9.8%) developed HCC. Multivariable analyses showed that compared with lamivudine, entecavir therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of death or transplantation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.64), but a similar risk of HCC (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.87-1.34). In the 1792 overall propensity-matched pairs, entecavir again was associated with a significantly lower risk of death or transplantation (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37-0.64) and a similar risk of HCC (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.80-1.27). Entecavir also reduced the risk of death or transplantation, compared with lamivudine, in 860 pairs of patients with cirrhosis (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.31-0.57) but there were no differences in risk for HCC (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.78-1.28). However, entecavir and lamivudine did not have significantly different effects on clinical outcome in 878 pairs of patients without cirrhosis.In a retrospective study of 5374 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, entecavir therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of death or transplantation than lamivudine. However, the drugs did not have different effects on HCC risk.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583062","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.764428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.693722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.548814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.492566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.37002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.338413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.316275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Lamivudine","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.261872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Entecavir","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entecavir"},{"name":"Seoul","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"November 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_1"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Talent agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
