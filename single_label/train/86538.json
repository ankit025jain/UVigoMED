{"id":86538,"title":"Impact of sociodemographic factors on the radiotherapeutic management of lung cancer: Results of a Quality Research in Radiation Oncology survey.","abstract":"The objective of this study is to describe the impact of sociodemographic (SOC) factors on the management of lung cancer patients treated at radiation therapy facilities participating in the Quality Research in Radiation Oncology survey.A 2-stage stratified random sample of lung cancer patients treated in 2006 to 2007 at 45 facilities yielded 340 stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 144 limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) cases. Five SOC variables based on data from the 2000 US Census were analyzed for association with the following clinical factors: patients living in urban versus rural settings (U/R); median household income (AHI); % below poverty level (PPV); % unemployed (PUE); and % with college education (PCE).The 340 NSCLC patients were stage I, 16%; stage II, 11%; stage III, 62%; stage unknown, 11%. Histologic subtypes were adenocarcinoma, 31.8%; squamous cell carcinoma, 35.3%; large cell carcinoma, 3.2%; and NSCLC NOS, 27.7%. The median age was 66 years. Median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 80. The 144 LS-SCLC had a median age of 63; 73 were male (50.7%). Median KPS was 80. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and modern imaging utilization was associated with treatment at facilities located in higher SOC regions. SBRT was employed in 46.8% stage I NSCLC patients treated in centers where %PUE was below median versus 14.8% in centers where %PUE was above median (P = .02). Four-dimensional computed tomography was utilized in 14.2% of patients treated in centers located in regions with %PPV below median versus 3.7% in centers located in regions with %PPV above median (P < .01). SCLC patients were more likely to receive all of their planned RT when treated at centers located in regions with lower PPV (95.0% vs 79.1%; P = .04).SOC factors may impact use of modern treatment planning and delivery and multidisciplinary management of NSCLC and SCLC. These results may suggest an impact of these SOC factors on access to health care.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Respiratory Tract
