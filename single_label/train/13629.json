{"id":13629,"title":"Potential pharmacokinetic interactions of therapeutic cytokines or cytokine modulators on small-molecule drugs: mechanistic understanding via studies using in vitro systems.","abstract":"The potential pharmacokinetic interactions between macromolecules and small-molecule drugs have received more and more attention with the increasing development of macromolecule therapeutics. Studies have shown that cytokines can differentially modulate drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, which raises concerns on the potential interactions of therapeutic cytokines and cytokine modulators on the disposition of small-molecule drugs. Although many in vitro studies have been conducted to characterize the effects of cytokines on drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, these studies were limited to only a handful of cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-?, and interferon. It is also challenging to translate these in vitro results to in vivo. In addition, information on the impact of cytokine modulators on drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters is rather limited. More research is needed in this area. The present review is to provide a summary of the in vitro findings on the pharmacokinetic interactions of therapeutic cytokines and cytokine modulators on small-molecule drugs. Discussion on current challenges in assessing these interactions is also included.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468612","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Macromolecule","weight":0.864161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromolecule"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.712667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.525521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.403582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.298803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.199121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.105451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.0641452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
