{"id":52831,"title":"The relationship between serum hypoxia-inducible factor 1? and coronary artery calcification in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients.","abstract":"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis, is a heterodimer consisting of HIF-1? and HIF-1? subunits, and is implicated in calcification of cartilage and vasculature. The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between serum HIF-1? with coronary artery calcification (CAC) in patients with type 2 diabetes.The subjects were 405 (262 males, 143 females, age 51.3?±?6.4 years) asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Serum HIF-1? and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured by ELISA. CAC scores were assessed by a 320-slice CT scanner. The subjects were divided into 4 quartiles depending on serum HIF-1? levels.Average serum HIF-1? was 184.4?±?66.7 pg/ml. Among patients with higher CAC scores, HIF-1? levels were also significantly increased (p <0.001). HIF-1? levels positively correlated with CRP, IL-6, UKPDS risk score, HbA1c, FBG, and CACS, but did not correlate with diabetes duration, age, and LDL. According to the multivariate analysis, HIF-1? levels significantly and independently predict the presence of CAC. ROC curve analysis showed that the serum HIF-1? level can predict the extent of CAC, but the specificity was lower than the traditional risk factors UKPDS and HbA1c.As a marker of hypoxia, serum HIF-1? level may be an independent risk factor for the presence of CAC. These findings indicate that elevated serum HIF-1? may be involved in vascular calcification in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564828","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.839264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.752037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Protein dimer","weight":0.751267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_dimer"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.632099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.467162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.320291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
