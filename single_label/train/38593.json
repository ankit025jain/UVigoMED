{"id":38593,"title":"Progressive cardiac dysfunction in Bethlem myopathy during pregnancy.","abstract":"Bethlem myopathy is a congenital myopathy presenting with muscle weakness and joint abnormalities. Although cardiac involvement is frequent in other inherited myopathies, it has not yet been described in Bethlem myopathy.We report a case of progressive deterioration of left ventricular function during pregnancy in a patient with Bethlem myopathy. Worsening of clinical symptoms, particularly dyspnea, necessitated delivery at 36 2/7 weeks of gestation. Myocardial function recovered postpartum with improvement of clinical symptoms.Bethlem myopathy may be associated with progressive left ventricular dysfunction during pregnancy and may require early delivery.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413245","annotations":[{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Muscle weakness","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.669644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Myopathy","weight":0.606562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopathy"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.585027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.529032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.380205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.190214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.161224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.123648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Bethlem Royal Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlem_Royal_Hospital"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"}]}
