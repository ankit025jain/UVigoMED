{"id":87610,"title":"[The specificities of orthopedic trauma in the geriatric patient].","abstract":"Aging of the population represents an ubiquitous and ever-growing phenomenon in the developed countries. Geriatric traumatology is a constant-developping sub-speciality of orthopedics and traumatology; it deals with the specific medical problems developed by older patients when affected by muskuloskeletal trauma. The optimal treatment of this pathology as well as the age threshold used to define the \"geriatric\" patient are still subjects of debate. Chronological age cannot be used as the sole inclusion criteria; physiological age as defined by comorbidities seems to be more appropriate. The aim of this article is to provide a general overview of the problems that the orthopedic surgeons faces when dealing with geriatric trauma: timing of surgery and anesthesia, technical aspects of surgery and fractures, complications and problems with the postoperative management of geriatric patients. Geriatric trauma is already today an important problem; it will certainly become a great challenge in coming years. The solution must reside in a multidisciplinary approach backed up by a solid infra-structure and good management decisions.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065248","annotations":[{"name":"Geriatric trauma","weight":0.833244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatric_trauma"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Orthopedics","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedics"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.711491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Traumatology","weight":0.642588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatology"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.5799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.387514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.359386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Internal combustion engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine"},{"name":"Face (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(geometry)"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary approach","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_approach"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Ubiquitous computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing"},{"name":"Chronology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Infrastructure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"},{"name":"Inclusion (disability rights)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_(disability_rights)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
