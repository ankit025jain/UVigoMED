{"id":45439,"title":"Dual role of acetaminophen in promoting hepatoma cell apoptosis and kidney fibroblast proliferation.","abstract":"Acetaminophen (APAP), is a safe analgesic and antipyretic drug at therapeutic dose, and is widely used in the clinic. However, high doses of APAP can induce hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Most studies have focused on high?dose APAP?induced acute liver and kidney injury. So far, few studies have investigated the effects of the therapeutic dose (1/10 of the high dose) or of the low dose (1/100 of the high dose) of APAP on the cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular effects of therapeutic- or low?dose APAP treatment on hepatoma cells and kidney fibroblasts. As expected, high?dose APAP treatment inhibited while therapeutic and low?dose treatment did not inhibit cell survival of kidney tubular epithelial cells. In addition, therapeutic-dose treatment induced an increase in the H2O2 level, activated the caspase?9/?3 cascade, and induced cell apoptosis of hepatoma cells. Notably, APAP promoted fibroblast proliferation, even at low doses. This study demonstrates that different cellular effects are exerted upon treatment with different APAP concentrations. Our results indicate that treatment with the therapeutic dose of APAP may exert an antitumor activity on hepatoma, while low?dose treatment may be harmful for patients with fibrosis, since it may cause proliferation of fibroblasts.
