{"id":54107,"title":"Protocol for the examination of specimens from patients with pheochromocytomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas.","abstract":"During the last decade there have been revolutionary breakthroughs in understanding the biology of pheochromocytomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas. Discoveries of new susceptibility genes and genotype-phenotype correlations have led to the realization that appropriate patient care requires a complete integration of clinical, genetic, biochemical, imaging, and pathology findings. Clinical practice has in many cases not kept pace with the rate of discovery, underscoring a need for updated procedures for evaluation of patient specimens and reporting of data. We therefore propose a new synoptic reporting approach for pheochromocytomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas that will provide clear and uniform information to pathologists and clinicians, in order to advance the diagnosis of these neoplasms and optimize patient care.
