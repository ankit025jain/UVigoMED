{"id":78454,"title":"[Basilar type migraine: clinical features, differential diagnosis].","abstract":"The work is devoted to the description of neurological, vestibulometric and audiologic data obtained in the examination of 11 patients with basilar type migraine. The features of the disease (neck injuries before the disease, prolonged aura, protracted attacks, similarity with the clinical picture of stroke, occipital pain, cervical root syndrome, muscle-tonus phenomena and others) are described. A role of cervical pathology and labyrinthine hydrops in the disease pathogenesis as well as difficulties of differential diagnosis with Ménière's disease and Barre-Lieou syndrome are discussed.
