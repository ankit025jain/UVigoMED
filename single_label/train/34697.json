{"id":34697,"title":"Early biomarkers of renal injury and protective effect of erythropoietin on kidneys of asphyxiated newborn rats.","abstract":"The aims of this study were to determine which of the two biomarkers of renal injury, kidney injury molecule-1 or cystatin C, is more sensitive and to evaluate whether erythropoietin protects kidneys injured by perinatal asphyxia.Animals were split into three groups designated as follows: AE, pups that survived perinatal asphyxia and subsequently received 2.5 ?g (0.1?ml) of darbepoetin-? (i.p.); A, the pups that survived perinatal asphyxia and received 0.1?ml of 0.9% NaCl; and C, control group. The pups were killed at different ages of life (6?h, 24?h, 48?h, 7 d, and 14 d of age; 10 rats in each subgroup). Immunohistopathological evaluation of kidneys was performed.At 48?h and on days 7 and 14, absolute injury scores were significantly lower in group AE as measured by both biomarkers. Cystatin C expression was the most intensive 6?h after the hypoxic event (average value of absolute injury score was 2.82) and declined over time. Expression of kidney injury molecule-1 was less intensive, with the average value of absolute injury score being 2.02 at 6?h and 2.105 at 24?h; the peak value (2.155) was recorded 48?h after the hypoxic event.Erythropoietin has a protective effect on hypoxic kidneys. Cystatin C is more sensitive as an early biomarker of acute kidney injury in comparison with kidney injury molecule-1.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713815","annotations":[{"name":"Erythropoietin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.845772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.809788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.805588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.645987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.602344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.579766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.526676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Sodium chloride","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.352099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.337213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Asphyxia","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia"},{"name":"Cystatin","weight":0.281463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystatin"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.226509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0782123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Perinatal asphyxia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perinatal_asphyxia"},{"name":"Cystatin C","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystatin_C"},{"name":"Darbepoetin alfa","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darbepoetin_alfa"},{"name":"American English","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"}]}
