{"id":23318,"title":"Novel regimens identified in mice for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in contacts of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.","abstract":"Preventing the development of tuberculosis (TB) in contacts of patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) by the treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) is highly desirable. However, few safe, well tolerated, and effective drugs are available to treat MDR-LTBI and the published guidance is limited. Fortunately, six new chemical entities from four classes developed to treat TB have entered clinical trials in the past decade. We tested three of these drugs alone and in combination in an experimental paucibacillary LTBI chemotherapy model using BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ mice immunized with a recombinant strain of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (rBCG30) and then challenged with a low-dose aerosol of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The regimens tested contained bedaquiline (TMC), PA-824 (Pa), sutezolid (PNU), and/or one of two fluoroquinolones. Control mice received rifampin (RIF) or isoniazid (INH). In BALB/c mice, TMC-containing regimens and the Pa-PNU combination were the most active test regimens and were at least as effective as RIF. Pa, PNU, and levofloxacin had activity comparable to that of INH. Virtually identical results were observed in C3HeB/FeJ mice. This study confirms the potent activity of TMC observed previously in BALB/c mice and highlights Pa alone or in combination with either PNU or a fluoroquinolone as a regimen worthy of evaluation in future clinical trials of MDR-LTBI. Given their closer pathological representation of human TB lesions, C3HeB/FeJ mice may become a preferred model for the experimental chemotherapy of LTBI. Future studies should evaluate additional clinically relevant LTBI regimens in this strain including relapse as an endpoint.
