{"id":15763,"title":"Lyme disease in Poland in 2012.","abstract":"In Poland registration of all cases of Lyme disease is conducted by the Epidemiological Unit of National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene. Most cases of Lyme disease occur in the North- East region of Poland; however, it is important to note that the disease is no longer solely a problem of this region of Poland.The aim of this work is to assess the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland in 2012 as compared to the situation in the previous years.Assessment of the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland was made on the basis of an analysis of individual notifications of suspected Lyme disease submitted to NIZP-NIH by the Provincial Sanitary- Epidemiological Stations; as well as data from \"Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2012\" bulletin, and \"Vaccinations in Poland in 2012\" bulletin (MP Czarkowski and Co, Warsaw 2013, NIPH-NIH, NCI).In 2012 there were 8 782 registered cases of Lyme disease and it is 4.3% higher than in the previous year. The overall incidence in the country amounted to 23.8 per 100 000 people. The highest incidence rate was recorded in Podlaskie province - 75.5 per 100 000 people. 2 063 people were hospitalized due to Lyme disease.In 2012 incidence rate of Lyme disease was gradually dropping down. The registered number of cases was reduced by 4.1% in comparison to the previous year. There is still a fairly low percentage of cases detected with diagnostic test called Western blot method.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135514","annotations":[{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.729716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Lyme disease","weight":0.495556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.453049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Warsaw","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.377528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.32337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.263688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.197118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.122128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"National Cancer Institute","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute"},{"name":"Member of Parliament","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"782","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/782"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"North East England","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_England"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Public university","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Royal Institute of Public Health","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Institute_of_Public_Health"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Licensure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensure"},{"name":"National Institute of Public Health of Japan","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Public_Health_of_Japan"},{"name":"Podlaskie Voivodeship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podlaskie_Voivodeship"}]}
