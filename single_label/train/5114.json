The building inhabitants were smoothly evacuated by commands given over the loudspeakers of the responding emergency workers. They walked quickly through the decontamination tents, following the directions of the hazmat team, and were transported without difficulty by squads and buses to local hospitals and trauma centers, where teams of medical professionals quickly and efficiently cared for them, using familiar protocols and equipment.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322516","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.756096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Dangerous goods","weight":0.702542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_goods"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Explosion","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosion"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.601702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Emergency service","weight":0.58717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.541329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.475548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Train","weight":0.456984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train"},{"name":"Disaster","weight":0.385089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.295323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Bus","weight":0.213002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"},{"name":"Freight rail transport","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_rail_transport"},{"name":"Emergency evacuation","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_evacuation"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Cargo","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo"},{"name":"Chemical warfare","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare"},{"name":"Tent","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Human decontamination","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_decontamination"},{"name":"Cloud","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Loudspeaker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker"},{"name":"Command (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_(computing)"},{"name":"Familiar spirit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_spirit"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"}]}
