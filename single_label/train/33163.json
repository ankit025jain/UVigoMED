{"id":33163,"title":"Anaesthesia of conjoined twins.","abstract":"Conjoined twins have been a source of fascination to the public and the medical profession for centuries. Their birth was initially viewed as an ominous sign of impending disaster. Since Middle Ages into the 19th century they were regarded as monstrosities and were exhibited at circuses and sideshows. The frequency of conjoined twins is approximately 1 in 50,000 gestation, but many of them die in utero, are terminated or stillborn. The true incidence is estimated to be 1 in 200,000 live births. This article gives an overview of Siamese twins and of the prenatal diagnosis in assessing the prognosis, anaesthetic and post-natal surgical management and outcome. Anaesthesia for conjoined twins surgery, whether prior to or for separation, is an enormous challenge to the anaesthesiologist. The site and complexity of the conjunction affect management of the airway, an intravenous access, the extent of blood and number of surgical specialties involved. Preoperative assessment and planning with interdisciplinary communication and cooperation is vital to the success of the operations. Meticulous attention to detail, monitoring and vigilance are mandatory.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24858973","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Stillbirth","weight":0.7963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillbirth"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.791356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Middle Ages","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.688919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.63907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Conjoined twins","weight":0.622844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjoined_twins"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.567388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.526181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"In utero","weight":0.297845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_utero"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0636352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Circus","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Disaster","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster"},{"name":"Century","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"2012 phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
