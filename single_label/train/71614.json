{"id":71614,"title":"[A multi-center retrospective study of L-asparaginase-based regimens as first-line treatment in newly diagnosed extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma].","abstract":"To analyze the short-term efficacy, overall survival (OS), and safety in newly diagnosed extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) patients with L-asparaginase based regimens or CHOP regimen in combination with radiotherapy as first-line treatment.Of the total 181 patients diagnosed by imaging and pathology, 69 patients received CHOP regimen and 112 patients received L-asparaginase based regimens. All the patients received radical radiotherapy(RT)after 6 cycles of chemotherapy.The overall response rates of L-asparaginase-based group and CHOP group were 90.2% and 72.5%, respectively (P=0.002). The 1, 2, 5-year OS and progression-free survival (PFS) in L-asparaginase-based group were 96.0%, 88.3%, 65.1% and 94.2%, 79.8%, 50.0%, respectively. The 1, 2, 5-year OS and PFS in CHOP group were 82.6%, 61.9%, 28.4% and 63.8%, 44.0%, 21.0% (P=0.000).Compared with CHOP regimen, L-asparaginase-based chemotherapy is more effective and safe for newly diagnosed nasal-type ENKTL.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052604","annotations":[{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.619203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.41165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.198552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.18779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"CHOP","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOP"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"}]}
