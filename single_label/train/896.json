{"id":896,"title":"Effects of oral hormone replacement therapy on mean platelet volume in postmenopausal women.","abstract":"To examine the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on mean platelet volume (MPV), lipid profile, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in postmenopausal women who have a high risk and incidence of cardiovascular disease.This study was performed retrospectively. Twenty-seven healthy postmenopausal women received 1 mg estradiol and 2 mg drospirenone orally for 6 months. Twenty-eight healthy postmenopausal women not taking any HRT were admitted to the study as the control population.Time effect (independent from group effect) was statistically significant for the MPV variable (P = 0.025), but there was no significant change in MPV levels and other cardiovascular disease risk markers in women receiving HRT compared to women in the control group.Younger postmenopausal women taking HRT and women who initiated hormone therapy close to menopause are not at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552150","annotations":[{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)","weight":0.811199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy_(menopause)"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.667473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.5543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.549655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.392584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.238585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.118354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Drospirenone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drospirenone"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
