{"id":53163,"title":"Prevalence of androgenic alopecia in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and characterization of associated clinical and biochemical features.","abstract":"To describe the prevalence of androgenic alopecia (AGA) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to characterize associated clinical and biochemical features.Cross-sectional study.Multidisciplinary PCOS clinic at a tertiary academic center.A total of 254 women with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria were systematically examined from 2007 to 2012 by a reproductive endocrinologist, a dermatologist, and a psychologist.Comprehensive dermatologic exams, ultrasonic imaging, serum testing, and Beck Depression Inventory Fast Screen (BDI-FS).Presence of AGA, acne, hirsutism, biochemical hyperandrogenemia, metabolic dysfunction, and clinical depression.Fifty-six of 254 patients with PCOS (22.0%) had AGA. Subjects with PCOS and AGA were more likely to have acne or hirsutism than those without AGA (96.3% vs. 70.6%). Subjects with AGA were more likely to report concern with hair loss (70.4% vs. 37.7%); however, their BDI-FS scores were no different from subjects without AGA. There were no differences between subjects with and without AGA in biochemical hyperandrogenism or metabolic parameters.AGA is prevalent in 22% of subjects meeting diagnostic criteria for PCOS. AGA is associated with other manifestations of clinical hyperandrogenism, but not with greater risk of biochemical hyperandrogenemia or metabolic dysfunction than with PCOS alone.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534277","annotations":[{"name":"Hirsutism","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsutism"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.874168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.850619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Acne","weight":0.834993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.822923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Androgenic alopecia","weight":0.816629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgenic_alopecia"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.741108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.68384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hyperandrogenism","weight":0.538159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperandrogenism"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.489789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Psychologist","weight":0.383578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.341081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Reproductive endocrinology and infertility","weight":0.246458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_endocrinology_and_infertility"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.0903151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Beck Depression Inventory","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck_Depression_Inventory"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Think tank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"}]}
