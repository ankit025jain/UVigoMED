{"id":80230,"title":"IL-25 exhibits disparate roles during Th2-cell differentiation versus effector function.","abstract":"A keenly sought therapeutic approach for the treatment of allergic disease is the identification and neutralization of the cytokine that regulates the differentiation of T helper 2 (Th2) cells. Th2 cells are exciting targets for asthma therapies. Recently, the cytokine IL-25 has been shown to enhance Th2-type immune activity and play important roles in mediating allergic inflammatory responses. To investigate this further, we crossed IL-25(-/-) C57BL/6 mice with G4 IL-4 C57BL/6 reporter mice and developed an assay for in vitro and in vivo IL-4-independent Th2-cell differentiation. These assays were used to determine whether IL-25 was critical for the formation of Th2 cells. We found there was no physiological role for IL-25 in either the differentiation of Th2 cells or their development to effector or memory Th2-cell subsets. Importantly, this data challenges the newly found and growing status of the cytokine IL-25 and its proposed role in promoting Th2-cell responses.
