{"id":24050,"title":"[Pasteurella multocida meningitis with cerebral abscesses].","abstract":"Pasteurella multocida is classically responsible for local soft tissue infections secondary to dog bites or cat scratches. It can be responsible for meningitis in infants and elderly persons. We report the case history of a 5-year-old male child admitted to our pediatric unit for meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed an infection with P. multocida. The suspected mode of contamination was either from the saliva of a pet dog or through an unnoticed skull fracture sustained after an accident 1 year prior to the occurrence of meningitis. In spite of the neurologic complication (cerebral abscess), the progression was favorable after drainage of the abscess, 5 weeks of parenteral treatment, and 3 weeks of oral antibiotic therapy. Meningitis due to Pasteurella sp. is rare and can lead to neurologic complications. The notion of bites or scratches can be absent and the mode of contamination is sometimes difficult to unveil.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457110","annotations":[{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.63861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Pet","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.395494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.329793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.201462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.137759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Skull fracture","weight":0.127267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_fracture"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Pasteurella","weight":0.0322457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurella"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Pasteurella multocida","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurella_multocida"},{"name":"Bite","weight":0.0193761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"}]}
