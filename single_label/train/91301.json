{"id":91301,"title":"An innovative intrastromal keratoprosthesis surgery assisted by femtosecond laser.","abstract":"To demonstrate the surgical application of a new model of epidescemetic keratoprosthesis.A 53-year-old man was referred to our center with severe alkali burns in both eyes and was treated by a combined corneal graft associated with KeraKlear implantation assisted by femtosecond laser and cataract surgery with implantation of an intraocular lens.After 1 month, visual acuity was 0.6 logMAR in both eyes with -2 sphere correction. Slit-lamp examination and anterior segment optical coherence tomography revealed that the device was centered in the pupil area with no infection. No sign of extrusion was detected.The advantage of this device is that it involves nonperforating surgery, thus reducing the postoperative risk of infection and necrosis of tissue around the prosthesis. Large-scale studies with a long follow-up period are required to evaluate the outcome of use of this device.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519504","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.944133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.88253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.742814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.668255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.642622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.552351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.460932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.4412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Alkali","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.258256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Anterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.177919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Extrusion","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"}]}
