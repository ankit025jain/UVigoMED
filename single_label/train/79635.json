{"id":79635,"title":"The relationships of marsupial-dwelling Viannaiidae and description of Travassostrongylus scheibelorum sp. n. (Trichostrongylina: Heligmosomoidea) from mouse opossums (Didelphidae) from French Guiana.","abstract":"The trichostrongylid nematode Travassostrongylus scheibelorum sp. n. from the Linnaeus' mouse opossum, Marmosa murina (Linnaeus) (type host), and the woolly mouse opossum, Marmosa demerarae (Thomas), from French Guiana is described. The nematodes have a synlophe with ridges frontally oriented from right to left, six dorsal and six ventral, at midbody; seven dorsal and seven ventral posterior to the vulva, and two cuticular thickenings within the lateral spaces; a long dorsal ray and a pointed cuticular flap covering the vulva. This is the 12th species of Travassostrongylus Orloff, 1933, which includes species featuring ridges around the synlophe and a didelphic condition. These traits contrast with those in other genera in the Viannaiidae Neveu-Lemaire, 1934, which feature ventral ridges on the synlophe of adults and a monodelphic condition. Members of the family are chiefly Neotropical and are diagnosed based on the presence of a bursa of the type 2-2-1, 2-1-2 or irregular, and cuticle without ridges on the dorsal side (at least during one stage of their development). Herein, we present a reconstruction of the ancestral states of the didelphic/monodelphic condition and the cuticular ridges that form the synlophe in opossum-dwelling trichostrongyles, namely Travassostrongylus and Viannaia Travassos, 1914. Our investigations suggest they are not reciprocal sister taxa and that the change from didelphy to monodelphy and the loss of dorsal ridges, occurred in the common ancestor of species of Viannaia. These results suggest a synlophe with three ventral ridges is not plesiomorphic in the opossum dwelling trichostrongylids.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065130","annotations":[{"name":"French Guiana","weight":0.880059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.844581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.838126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Opossum","weight":0.793108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opossum"},{"name":"Carl Linnaeus","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus"},{"name":"Taxon","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Vulva","weight":0.773817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulva"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Neotropic ecozone","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neotropic_ecozone"},{"name":"Plesiomorphic","weight":0.682016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiomorphic"},{"name":"Cuticle","weight":0.661005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuticle"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Ventral","weight":0.600462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventral"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.399048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Batoidea","weight":0.252494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batoidea"},{"name":"Common descent","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_descent"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.118784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"France","weight":0.112659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Marmosa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmosa"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Oldfield Thomas","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldfield_Thomas"},{"name":"Stage (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Wool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Linnaeus's mouse opossum","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaeus's_mouse_opossum"},{"name":"Fingerprint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0116672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
