{"id":2744,"title":"[Micro-invasive glaucoma surgery].","abstract":"Intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction is the current treatment in glaucoma. In recent years, minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) has been added to the arsenal of surgical options. MIGS can reduce trabecular meshwork resistance to outflow and decrease the IOP with mild side effects. In this article, we review the clinical experience gathered with iSTENT, Bypass, Gold Micro Shunt and the Trabectome.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518075","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.872951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.761554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.622042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.530849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.377973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Trabecular meshwork","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabecular_meshwork"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Glaucoma surgery","weight":0.113933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma_surgery"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Arsenal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal"},{"name":"Trabecula","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabecula"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Tropical cyclone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone"}]}
