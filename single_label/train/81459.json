{"id":81459,"title":"Bone recontouring in fresh sockets with buccal bone loss: a cone beam computed tomography study.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess buccal bone plate recontouring in maxillary fresh extraction sockets with buccal bone loss using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).Healthy patients who required the extraction of one tooth with buccal bone loss in the maxilla were included in this study. CBCT examinations were made before extractions and after 3 months. The alveolar bone levels were assessed from the most coronal, buccal, and palatal bone in which the crest was identified. Buccolingual width at the apical and coronal level was also measured.Fifty healthy patients underwent 50 extractions. Mean bone levels for both single-rooted and multiple-rooted teeth, from a buccopalatal perspective, showed no statistically significant difference between preextraction status and 3 months later. However, in both groups, mean bone levels of the buccal bone plate showed statistically significant differences between extraction and 3 months later. In single-rooted teeth, a mean bone gain of 5.36 ± 2.65 mm was seen after 3 months, and for multiple-rooted teeth, a mean bone gain of 5.89 ± 2.88 mm was seen. Growth in buccolingual width was seen; nevertheless, volume dimensional changes were reported after tooth extraction.In the first months after extraction, it is possible to observe the formation of buccal bone in sockets with previous buccal bone loss.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25032766","annotations":[{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.647416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.606408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.413171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.365185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.361862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.332838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.252285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Dental alveolus","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_alveolus"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"CBCT (TV)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBCT_(TV)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"70 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70_mm_film"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.8_cm_Flak_18/36/37/41"},{"name":"Cone (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry)"},{"name":"Crest (heraldry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(heraldry)"},{"name":"Beam (nautical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)"},{"name":"Spiral computed tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
