There is a need for biomarkers for prediction of survival and guiding individual therapy. MiR-155 is one of most commonly upregulated miRNAs in malignancies, and regulates multiple pro-oncogenic pathways. We aimed to investigate the prognostic impact of miR-155 in resected stage III NSCLC patients.Tumor formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) from 162 resected stage III NSCLC patients were collected. Total RNA including miRNA was extracted, and qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression of miR-155.Spearman rank correlation test showed a positive correlation between miR-155 expression and nodal status (r=0.169, P=0.032). MiR-155 expression had a significant prognostic impact in the total cohort (P<0.001), in squamous cell carcinomas (P=0.002) and in adenocarcinomas (P=0.003). In N0-1 subgroup, miR-155 expression did not have a significant prognostic on overall survival in univariate analysis (P=0.319). In N2 subgroup, miR-155 had a negative prognostic effect on OS in univariate analysis (P<0.001). Cox regression analysis revealed that miR-155 expression was unfavorable prognostic factors of OS (RR=2.311, 95%CI: 1.479-3.611, P<0.001).High expression of miR-155 represents a valuable marker of poor clinical outcomes in patients with stage III NSCLC.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854560","annotations":[{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.687637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.683038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.645936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.624215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.54584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.454162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.43271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.405091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.241559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
