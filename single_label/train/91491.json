{"id":91491,"title":"Anatomic shoulder arthroplasty as treatment for locked posterior dislocation of the shoulder.","abstract":"Chronic locked shoulder dislocations account for 2% to 5% of all shoulder dislocations. There is little information regarding the mid-term to long-term results of anatomic shoulder arthroplasty for treatment of this problem.Thirty-two shoulder arthroplasties were performed in thirty-two patients who had chronic locked posterior dislocation of the shoulder. Eighteen patients were treated with a hemiarthroplasty and fourteen, with a total shoulder arthroplasty. Inclusion criteria included moderate or severe pain and functional limitations. Structural indications included an impression fracture involving ?45% of the humeral head, fibrosis of the articular cartilage, and/or severe osteopenia of the humeral head. When one-third or more of the glenoid was devoid of articular cartilage, a glenoid component was placed. All patients were followed for a minimum of two years (mean, 8.2 years) or until a reoperation.The operations led to pain relief, with the median pain score decreasing from 4 (on a 5-point scale) preoperatively to 3 postoperatively (p < 0.01), and improvement in shoulder external rotation, from a preoperative median of -15° to a postoperative median of 50° (p < 0.001). Instability recurred in three patients in the early postoperative period. Nine patients underwent a reoperation for various reasons. According to a modified Neer rating system, there were four excellent, fifteen satisfactory, and thirteen unsatisfactory outcomes.Although shoulder arthroplasty for locked posterior dislocation can provide pain relief, improved shoulder external rotation, and a low risk of recurrent instability, the overall rate of satisfaction is inferior to that following anatomic arthroplasty for treatment of glenohumeral osteoarthritis.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24500591","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.755358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Glenohumeral joint","weight":0.662889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral_joint"},{"name":"External rotation","weight":0.553808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_rotation"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.509931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Osteopenia","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopenia"},{"name":"Glenoid cavity","weight":0.347037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenoid_cavity"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.337478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.330229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.317857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.285378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.100053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Dislocated shoulder","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocated_shoulder"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hemiarthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiarthroplasty"},{"name":"Upper extremity of humerus","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_extremity_of_humerus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Scale (map)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map)"},{"name":"Neer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neer"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"}]}
