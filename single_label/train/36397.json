{"id":36397,"title":"Full-length dystrophin reconstitution with adeno-associated viral vectors.","abstract":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common lethal muscle disorder in children. It is caused by mutations of the dystrophin gene. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene replacement therapy has been actively pursued to treat DMD. However, this promising therapeutic modality has been challenged by the small packaging capacity of the AAV vector. The size of the full-length dystrophin cDNA is >11?kb, while an AAV virus can carry only a 5?kb genome. Innovative high-capacity AAV vectors may offer an opportunity to express the full-length dystrophin coding sequence. Here we describe several sets of tri-AAV vectors for full-length human dystrophin delivery. In each set, the full-length human dystrophin cDNA was split into three fragments and independently packaged into separate recombinant AAV vectors. Each vector was engineered with unique recombination signals for directional recombination. Tri-AAV vectors were coinjected into the tibialis anterior muscle of dystrophin-deficient mdx4cv mice. Thirty-five days after injection, dystrophin expression was examined by immunofluorescence staining. Despite low reconstitution efficiency, full-length human dystrophin was successfully expressed from the tri-AAV vectors. Our results suggest that AAV can be engineered to express an extra-large (up to 15 kb) gene that is approximately three times the size of the wild-type AAV genome. Further optimization of the trivector strategy may expand the utility of AAV for human gene therapy.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24580018","annotations":[{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.950911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Human genome","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Complementary DNA","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_DNA"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.789684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.751192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Muscular dystrophy","weight":0.725844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Viral vector","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_vector"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.674425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Coding region","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.408618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Dystrophin","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystrophin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.155741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Adeno-associated virus","weight":0.0175845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adeno-associated_virus"},{"name":"Cultivar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Packaging and labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
