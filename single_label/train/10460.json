{"id":10460,"title":"Development and validation of a 4-plex antibody assay for simultaneous detection of IgG antibodies against Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1), TTSuV2, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus types 1 and 2.","abstract":"A fluorescent microbead-based immunoassay (FMIA) for simultaneous detection of IgG antibodies against Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1), TTSuV2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus type 1 (PRRSV-1) and PRRSV-2 was developed. Serum samples were obtained over time from 20 pigs. Twelve of 20 were exposed to TTSuV2 on day 0, 20/20 were vaccinated with a PRRSV-2 vaccine on day 35, and 20/20 were exposed to PRRSV-2 on day 63. Anti-TTSuV antibodies were detected in 30% of the pigs on day 0, and 90% by day 35. All PRRSV-2 vaccinated pigs had detectable anti-PRRSV-2 IgG 21 days after vaccination. Field samples from 17 farms were also tested. The seroprevalence of both PRRSV and TTSuV increased with age. Comparison of the PRRSV-2 FMIA to an ELISA revealed good correlation in young pigs but a high rate of false positives in older pigs. Cross-reaction between PRRSV types was a problem.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650623","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.823181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.746721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.729313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.727604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.649827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.606847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.598602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.59418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.471952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Suidae","weight":0.382072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suidae"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.297503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.295083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.147191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcine_Reproductive_and_Respiratory_Syndrome_Virus"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"2020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Suspended chord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_chord"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Torque","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"},{"name":"Teno","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teno"}]}
