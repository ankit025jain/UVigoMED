{"id":67879,"title":"An automatic multi-atlas segmentation of the prostate in transrectal ultrasound images using pairwise atlas shape similarity.","abstract":"Delineation of the prostate from transrectal ultrasound images is a necessary step in several computer-assisted clinical interventions, such as low dose rate brachytherapy. Current approaches to user segmentation require user intervention and therefore it is subject to user errors. It is desirable to have a fully automatic segmentation for improved segmentation consistency and speed. In this paper, we propose a multi-atlas fusion framework to automatically segment prostate transrectal ultrasound images. The framework initially registers a dataset of a priori segmented ultrasound images to a target image. Subsequently, it uses the pairwise similarity of registered prostate shapes, which is independent of the image-similarity metric optimized during the registration process, to prune the dataset prior to the fusion and consensus segmentation step. A leave-one-out cross-validation of the proposed framework on a dataset of 50 transrectal ultrasound volumes obtained from patients undergoing brachytherapy treatment shows that the proposed is clinically robust, accurate and reproducible.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579138","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.317819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.20609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.149145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Prune","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prune"},{"name":"A priori and a posteriori","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Image registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Automatic transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"},{"name":"Processor register","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register"},{"name":"Segmentation (image processing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(image_processing)"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Automatic firearm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_firearm"},{"name":"User (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0156195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Atlas","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"}]}
