{"id":51264,"title":"Efficacy of ginseng adventitious root extract on hyperglycemia in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.","abstract":"Ginseng has various bioactive effects on human health including its potential activity of improving the glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.Tissue culture raised mountain ginseng adventitious root (TCMGARs) extract enriched with ginsenosides was used as experimental material. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic 'Sprague Dawley' male rats were used as experimental systems and were fed with Tissue culture raised mountain ginseng adventitious root extract. Field cultivated Korean ginseng root extract fed rats were used as positive control and several indices such as body weight, blood glucose level and other serological indicators were tested.Chemical profile showed TCMGARs were rich in varied ginsenosides especially Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd, Rg3, and Rh2 when compared to field cultivated Korean ginseng. TCMGARs extract at dosage levels of 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight significantly lowered the blood glucose, total cholesterol and triglyceride content in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.The data of in vivo experiments on anti-glycemic effects of TCMGARs proves their efficacy and also their use as dietary supplement.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709314","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Ginseng","weight":0.787032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginseng"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.764115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.744206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.733921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.692984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.430793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.401749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.389455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Tissue culture","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_culture"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.15914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Ginsenoside","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginsenoside"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Retinoblastoma protein","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoblastoma_protein"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Korean language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Cardiac marker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_marker"},{"name":"Food fortification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_fortification"},{"name":"Rockwell scale","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_scale"},{"name":"Rhodium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodium"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
