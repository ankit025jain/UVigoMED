{"id":47167,"title":"Diagnostic and mechanistic implications of serum free light chains, albumin and alpha-fetoprotein in hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"Mass spectroscopy analysis suggested low serum albumin and high immunoglobulin free light chain (sFLC) levels may have diagnostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our aims were to apply quantitative assays to confirm these observations, determine their diagnostic utility, and investigate the mechanisms involved.Albumin, sFLC, routine liver and renal function tests were measured in patients with chronic liver disease with (n=102) and without (n=113) HCC. The discriminant performance was compared with the current standard serological test alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) analyses.sFLC and serum albumin were each confirmed to have discriminatory utility in HCC with AUC values of 0.7 and 0.8, respectively. sFLC were strongly correlated with gammaglobulin levels and both these were inversely related to serum albumin levels. The discriminatory utility of sFLC was retained after adjusting for renal and liver function.Serum levels of sFLC and albumin were strongly associated with HCC as predicted by mass spectroscopy. Discrimination of HCC by AFP was improved by the addition of either albumin or sFLC. Larger prospective studies are required to determine how AFP, sFLC and albumin might be combined in a useful diagnostic approach for HCC.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603305","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.778778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.771518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.748874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.641134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.532101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Gamma globulin","weight":0.320833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_globulin"},{"name":"Alpha-fetoprotein","weight":0.272222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-fetoprotein"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin light chain","weight":0.270347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_under_the_curve_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Side chain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_chain"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Chronic liver disease","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_liver_disease"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
