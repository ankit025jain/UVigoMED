{"id":82741,"title":"[Guiding values of facial nerve 3D-TOF-MRA and 3D-FIESTA scan for primary hemifacial spasm operation].","abstract":"To explore the operative guiding values of facial nerve three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D-TOF-MRA) and three-dimensional fast imaging employing steady state acquisition three-dimensional fast imaging employing steady state acquisition (3D-FIESTA) scan.A total of 125 cases of primary hemifacial spasm was treated at our hospital from 2004 to 2012. Among them, 80 cases received preoperative facial nerve MRA scan. The imaging and intraoperative findings were compared to determine the responsible blood vessels.Responsible blood vessels were found in all 80 cases. Sixty patients (75%) had the involvement of single vessel of anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA, n = 57), posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA, n = 1), superior cerebellar artery (SCA, n = 1) and vertebral artery (VA, n = 1). Two or more vessels were implicated in 9 patients (11.25%). The culprits were AICA+ internal auditory artery (n = 8) and PICA+ internal auditory artery (n = 1). The source of responsible vessels of 11 cases could not be determined before surgery. Through intraoperative anatomy, 59 patients had single vessel lesions, including AICA (n = 53), PICA (n = 4), SCA (n = 1) and VA (n = 1). Among 14 cases of multiple vessels, there were AICA + internal auditory artery (n = 7), internal auditory artery + PICA (n = 2), AICA + brain stem perforating artery (n = 3) and AICA + vein (n = 2). Seven cases were uncertain. No significant statistical difference existed between two groups.Facial nerve 3D-TOF-MRA and 3D-FIESTA scan can identify the status of responsible blood vessels to guide operations.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534314","annotations":[{"name":"Vertebral artery","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_artery"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.794661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.785844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Spasm","weight":0.686781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.679772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.62659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.576049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance angiography","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_angiography"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.252227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Posterior inferior cerebellar artery","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_inferior_cerebellar_artery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0881311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0548502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0334286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Superior cerebellar artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_cerebellar_artery"},{"name":"Anterior inferior cerebellar artery","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_inferior_cerebellar_artery"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"}]}
