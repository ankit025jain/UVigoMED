{"id":14481,"title":"Detection of bovine torovirus in fecal specimens from calves with diarrhea in Turkey.","abstract":"Bovine torovirus (BToV), a member of the family Coronaviridae, is an established gastrointestinal infectious agent in cattle. In this study, we performed a survey to detect BToV in Turkey between 2009 and 2011 using 235 fecal samples from neonatal calves with diarrhea that were analyzed by the nested reverse transcription (RT) PCR method using primers located in the consensus sequences of the BToV membrane (M) gene. The BToV M gene was detected in 4.7 % (11/235) of the samples using the nested RT-PCR method. The nucleotide sequences of partial M fragments from the BToV isolates, including the newly identified Turkish isolates, showed more than 96 % identity. The result indicates that BToV is one of the pathogens that contribute to neonatal calf diarrhea cases in Turkey.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24420162","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Reverse transcription","weight":0.751621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.682719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.641134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.508968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.280232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.19764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Consensus sequence","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_sequence"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Coronaviridae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronaviridae"},{"name":"Calf","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Nested polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_polymerase_chain_reaction"}]}
