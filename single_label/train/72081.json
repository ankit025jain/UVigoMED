{"id":72081,"title":"Cardiac myxoma originating from areas of ventricular akinesia.","abstract":"We present a case of large pedunculated myxoma (61Ã—39 mm) in the left ventricular cavity with anterior-septal and anterior free wall akinesia. Angiographic study showed normal coronary arteries, but the clinical signs strongly suggested a previous myocardial infarction. We cannot exclude the possibility that the ventricular akinesia results from embolization of tumor fragments. For a time, cardiac myxomas were believed to arise from mural thrombi. In this case the presence of blood stasis or low-velocity blood flow related to wall motion abnormalities may have played a role in improving tumor growth.
