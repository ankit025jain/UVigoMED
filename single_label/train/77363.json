{"id":77363,"title":"Rat-specific IgG and IgG? antibodies associated with inhibition of IgE-allergen complex binding in laboratory animal workers.","abstract":"The relationship between exposure to rodent allergens and laboratory animal allergy is complex; at highest allergen exposures there is an attenuation of sensitisation and symptoms which are associated with increased levels of rat-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgG4 antibodies. We set out to examine whether the increased levels of rat-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies that we have previously observed at high allergen exposure in our cohort of laboratory animal workers play a functional role through blockage of the binding of IgE-allergen complex binding to CD23 receptors on B cells.Cross-sectional survey of laboratory animal workers (n=776) in six UK pharmaceutical companies were surveyed. IgE-allergen complex binding to B cells was measured in 703 (97.9%) eligible employees; their exposure was categorised by either job group or number of rats handled daily.We observed a significant decrease in IgE-allergen complex binding to B cells with increasing quartiles of both rat-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies (p<0.001). IgE-allergen complex binding to B cells was lower in workers with high allergen exposure, and significantly so (p=0.033) in the subgroup with highest exposures but no work-related chest symptoms.These findings demonstrate a functional role for rat-specific IgG/G4 antibodies in laboratory animal workers, similar to that observed in patients treated with high dose immunotherapy who become clinically tolerant, suggesting a potential explanation for the attenuation of risk at highest allergen exposures.","date":"2014-08-09","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24944289","annotations":[{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.80691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.701005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.655324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.573568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.530537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.49545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.388064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical industry","weight":0.239959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0894997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"CD23","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD23"},{"name":"Sensitization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitization"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
