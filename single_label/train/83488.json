{"id":83488,"title":"Preliminary research concerning antinociceptive and antiinflammatory effects of two extracts from Glinus oppositifolius (L.) Aug. DC.","abstract":"In Mali Glinus oppositifolius (L.) Aug. DC. (Aizoaceae) is used to treat inflammations and joint pains.The present study was designed to evaluate the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of the aqueous and ethanol extracts obtained from the aerial parts of the plant.The aqueous and ethanol extracts (G-A1 and G-E1, respectively) were studied regarding their acute toxicity. The extracts were further evaluated in different models using nociceptive (chemical, thermal, mechanical) and inflammatory stimuli. Experimental protocol was implemented according to international regulations in animal experiments.No acute toxicity was noticed for these two extracts. ED50 (mg/kg bw) values were determined in different nociception models: the constrictive abdominal response test (G-A1: 229.00 +/- 53.30; G-E1: 146.38 +/- 31.75), hot plate test (G-A1: 278.59 +/- 73.00; G-E1: 383.52 +/- 89.69), Randall-Selitto test (G-A1: 207.14 +/- 26.15), evaluation of the inflammatory edema test (G-A1: 228.31 +/- 13.84; G-E1: 62.55 +/- 89.69).The results of the inflammatory nociception studies show that G-E1 extract had a higher potency than G-A1 extract in the constrictive abdominal response test. Also, for the same level of anti-inflammatory activity, G-E1 extract was more potent than G-A1 extract. These results encourage further studies to separate, isolate and identify the phytochemicals responsible for the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25341314","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.814491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.781633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.671336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.643318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.578707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.536827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.404175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mali","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.249309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Acute toxicity","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_toxicity"},{"name":"Phytochemical","weight":0.155638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochemical"},{"name":"Arthralgia","weight":0.146247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthralgia"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Thermal","weight":0.0970692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"General Electric","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Washington, D.C.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
