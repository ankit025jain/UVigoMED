{"id":30708,"title":"[Recreational usage of dextromethorphan--analysis based on internet users experiences].","abstract":"In the last decade we have observed a considerable increase in nonmedical usage of dextromethorphan (DXM) among young age groups, especially school children between 13 and 16 yrs. We analysed the \"trip reports\" after use of DXM, available on a website: www.hyperreal.info in the years 1999-2013. The data collected by authors were analysed according to: age, sex, symptoms, dose of DXM, a reason and a place of using the drug. A review of 124 \"trip reports\" showed that the majority of their writers are male (M 90.3%, F 9.7%). Young people, aged 16-20 (80.4%), dominated among the study population. The most common place of using DXM was a flat of a drug user (70.2%), and the reason of using a willingness to experiment with new psychoactive substances (41.9%) as well as the desire of \"get high\" (25.8%). The majority of users used DXM at least once again in their lives (56.5%). A single dose of the ingested drug ranged from 120 mg to 1575 mg (mean 539.25 mg). Most often received doses were 450 mg (30.4%), 300 mg (12%), 900 mg (11.2%). DXM was positively assessed by the internauts as a recreational psychoactive substance (84.7%). The most common clinical symptoms described by internauts were: difficulties with walking (74.2%), visual illusions (73.4%), altered sense of time (41.9%), feeling of exteriorisation (35.5%), euphoria (33.1%), nausea and vomiting (32.3%), auditory illusions (30.6%) and pruritus (29.8%).1. DXM is the popular psychoactive substance which has gained a positive opinion among the Internet users. 2. Easy accessibility of DXM may pose a serious threat to health of young people who experiment with psychoactive substances. 3. The improvement of DXM sales control should be considered.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466686","annotations":[{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Psychoactive drug","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug"},{"name":"Euphoria","weight":0.781812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.583707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.56717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.485456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Dextromethorphan","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextromethorphan"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.365706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.282573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.252868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.251349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.19681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.053154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Sales","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"1990s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Time perception","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_perception"},{"name":"Writer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer"},{"name":"Illusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion"},{"name":"Optical illusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_illusion"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
