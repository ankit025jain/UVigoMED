{"id":51560,"title":"Bariatric surgery versus intensive medical therapy for diabetes--3-year outcomes.","abstract":"In short-term randomized trials (duration, 1 to 2 years), bariatric surgery has been associated with improvement in type 2 diabetes mellitus.We assessed outcomes 3 years after the randomization of 150 obese patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes to receive either intensive medical therapy alone or intensive medical therapy plus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. The primary end point was a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0% or less.The mean (±SD) age of the patients at baseline was 48±8 years, 68% were women, the mean baseline glycated hemoglobin level was 9.3±1.5%, and the mean baseline body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 36.0±3.5. A total of 91% of the patients completed 36 months of follow-up. At 3 years, the criterion for the primary end point was met by 5% of the patients in the medical-therapy group, as compared with 38% of those in the gastric-bypass group (P<0.001) and 24% of those in the sleeve-gastrectomy group (P=0.01). The use of glucose-lowering medications, including insulin, was lower in the surgical groups than in the medical-therapy group. Patients in the surgical groups had greater mean percentage reductions in weight from baseline, with reductions of 24.5±9.1% in the gastric-bypass group and 21.1±8.9% in the sleeve-gastrectomy group, as compared with a reduction of 4.2±8.3% in the medical-therapy group (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Quality-of-life measures were significantly better in the two surgical groups than in the medical-therapy group. There were no major late surgical complications.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679060","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.80638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Gastric bypass surgery","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.757159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.723534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Bariatric surgery","weight":0.693564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sleeve gastrectomy","weight":0.405063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeve_gastrectomy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.280151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Bariatrics","weight":0.229382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatrics"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"}]}
