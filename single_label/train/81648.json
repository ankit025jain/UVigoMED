{"id":81648,"title":"Tooth wear in aging people: an investigation of the prevalence and the influential factors of incisal/occlusal tooth wear in northwest China.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of tooth wear in the aging population of northwest China and to investigate the factors associated with such tooth wear.Cross-sectional analytic clinical and questionnaire study was performed in 704 participants who had a mean age of 46.5?Â±?0.2 SD and of which 367(52.13%) were males and 337(47.87%) female. These participants were invited when they attended the hospital which located in northwest China for routine oral examination.In the maxilla of the examined patients, the rate of tooth wear varied from 85.51% for molar group, 89.77% for premolar group, 100.0% for canine group to 87.22% for incisor group. In the mandible, the rates were 86.36%, 88.92%, 100.0% and 91.19% for the four groups respectively. Moreover, both the incisor and canine groups of these patients showed median scores of 3, the premolar group showed a median score of 1, and the molar group had a median score of 2. Additionally, multiple factors were considered to contribute to these patterns of tooth wear, especially the habitual consumption of a hard or sour diet (P?<?0.05,odds ratio 1.21, 95% confidence intervals 1.04-1.49).Tooth wear is a common disease in which the anterior teeth exhibit greater wear than posterior teeth. The data support an association between tooth wear and dietary patterns.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902953","annotations":[{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"China","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.657259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.605583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.595305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Canine tooth","weight":0.592303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.552319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.451109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.418179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.196208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.177943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Taste","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"}]}
