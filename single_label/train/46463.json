{"id":46463,"title":"The E genotype of hepatitis B: clinical and virological characteristics, and response to interferon.","abstract":"10 hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes are known with different geographic distribution and response to interferon (IFN) therapy. The E genotype is the more prevalent genotype in West and Central Africa, but few data about response to IFN are available. We describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics in a cohort of patients immigrants from Africa in our country with HBV E genotype chronic hepatitis infection (CHB).63 patients with CHB and E genotype were included; 41 with CHB and low viral load were treated with PEG-IFN monotherapy; 10 with CHB and high viral load with sequential approach (entecavir and PEG-IFN). 12 patients with inactive CHB were followed with blood sample and abdomen ultrasonography every six months.The virological response in the monotherapy group was 17.9%. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss was observed in 1 patient (2.5%); 56 patients (88%) showed at the time of diagnosis of CHB another infectious diseases that required specific treatment before PEG-IFN; this treatment was also affected by an higher incidence of side-effects (>50%). All patients with high viremia showed a primary non-response to PEG-IFN.The HBV E genotype evidences the worse response to PEG-IFN and maybe requires novel treatment options.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631900","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.414759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Entecavir","weight":0.186667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entecavir"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.091096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Central Africa","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Africa"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
