{"id":68252,"title":"Generation of male differentiated germ cells from various types of stem cells.","abstract":"Infertility is a major and largely incurable disease caused by disruption and loss of germ cells. It affects 10-15% of couples, and male factor accounts for half of the cases. To obtain human male germ cells 'especially functional spermatids' is essential for treating male infertility. Currently, much progress has been made on generating male germ cells, including spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids, from various types of stem cells. These germ cells can also be used in investigation of the pathology of male infertility. In this review, we focused on advances on obtaining male differentiated germ cells from different kinds of stem cells, with an emphasis on the embryonic stem (ES) cells, the induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). We illustrated the generation of male differentiated germ cells from ES cells, iPS cells and SSCs, and we summarized the phenotype for these stem cells, spermatocytes and spermatids. Moreover, we address the differentiation potentials of ES cells, iPS cells and SSCs. We also highlight the advantages, disadvantages and concerns on derivation of the differentiated male germ cells from several types of stem cells. The ability of generating mature and functional male gametes from stem cells could enable us to understand the precise etiology of male infertility and offer an invaluable source of autologous male gametes for treating male infertility of azoospermia patients.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534952","annotations":[{"name":"Spermatogonium","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatogonium"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Spermatid","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Azoospermia","weight":0.793586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azoospermia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Spermatocyte","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatocyte"},{"name":"Germ cell","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Gamete","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Male infertility","weight":0.703062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_infertility"},{"name":"Pluripotent","weight":0.667421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluripotent"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.635199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.520715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.491104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Induced pluripotent stem cell","weight":0.255064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"}]}
