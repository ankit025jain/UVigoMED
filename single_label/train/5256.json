{"id":5256,"title":"[Quality evaluation on different specifications of cervi cornu pantotrichum with its effect on ovariectomized osteoporosis model rats].","abstract":"To study the effect of eight specifications of Cervi Cornu Pantotrichum on the osteoporosis of ovariectomized rats and grade the eight different specifications of Cervi Cornu Pantotrichum.Totally 100 SD female rats were divided randomly into 10 groups, namely the normal group, the model group and eight Cervi Cornu Pantotrichum groups of different specifications. Their bilateral ovaries were excised to reproduce the osteoporosis model. Meanwhile, the rats were given the eight different specifications of Cervi Cornu Pantotrichum for consecutively 12 weeks. Subsequently, the effects of the different specifications of Cervi Cornu Pantotrichum on bone mineral density and serum biochemical indicators of rats were observed. A clustering analysis was made for the eight specifications of Cervi Cornu Pantotrichum, with the serum content of ALP, BMP-2 and BGP as influencing factors.After 12 weeks, the eight different specifications of Cervi Cornu Pantotrichum could significantly improve ALP, BMP-2, BGP in serum and bone mineral density of ovariectomized rats. And the cluster analysis showed similar results to the quality classification of traditional commercial herbs Cervi Cornu Pantotrichum.Different specifications of Cervi Cornu Pantotrichum can antagonize the osteoporosis of ovariectomized rats, and their effects are related to the quality of commercial herbs.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25244769","annotations":[{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.803668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.270073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.221708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.17956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.176385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.168332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Border Gateway Protocol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol"},{"name":"BMP file format","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein 2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein_2"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Cornu (horn)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornu_(horn)"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Specification (technical standard)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"}]}
