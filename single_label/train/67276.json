{"id":67276,"title":"Laser-assisted hatching improves clinical outcomes of vitrified-warmed blastocysts developed from low-grade cleavage-stage embryos: a prospective randomized study.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of quarter zona-pellucida (ZP) opening by laser-assisted hatching (QLAH) on the clinical outcomes following transfer of vitrified-warmed blastocysts developed from low-grade cleavage-stage embryos in patients with all high-grade and fair-grade cleavage-stage embryos transferred without achieving pregnancy. Patients were randomized into two groups: QLAH (n=101) and control (n=102). The implantation and clinical pregnancy rates were significantly higher in the QLAH group compared with the control group (P=0.021 and P=0.034, respectively). The live birth rate of the QLAH group was also higher, although not significantly. When the clinical outcomes according to the day of blastocyst vitrification were compared between the groups, the implantation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates of the QLAH group were significantly higher (P<0.05) than those of the control group for day 6 blastocysts, but not for day 5 or day 5/day 6 blastocysts. These results suggest that QLAH improves the clinical outcomes of vitrified-warmed blastocysts, especially of day 6 vitrified blastocysts, developed from low-grade cleavage-stage embryos.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631166","annotations":[{"name":"Cryopreservation","weight":0.906247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopreservation"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Blastocyst","weight":0.728398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastocyst"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.692169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.515354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.355443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Birth rate","weight":0.242617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Zona pellucida","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zona_pellucida"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Vivipary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivipary"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Radioactive waste","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_waste"}]}
