{"id":30692,"title":"[Acute methoxetamine intoxication--a case report with serum and urine concentrations].","abstract":"Methoxetamine (MXE) is a novel synthetic drug, structurally related to phencyclidine, with ketamine-like properties. Available in Poland since 2010, with no legal control, is adverti. sed as the \"ideal dissociation drug\". The aim of this study was to present a case of nasal methoxetamine acute poisoning in a 28-year-old man, the course of treatment, and the method of identification of this substance in serum and urine. In the course of this intoxication extreme agitation and aggression with slight response to benzodiazepines were observed. The patient was confused, hallucinated. In addition, the physical examination re. vealed tachycardia 120/min and normal blood pressure (130/80 mm Hg). The period of acute poisoning was covered by amnesia. The MXE concentrations in serum and urine were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method, and were respectively 270 ng/ml and 660 ng/ml. Confirmed MXE poisoning increases our knowledge about this new substance, providing relevant clinical and analytical data.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466717","annotations":[{"name":"Poison","weight":0.816363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.721059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Phencyclidine","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine"},{"name":"Amnesia","weight":0.69329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.608697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Hallucination","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.532115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.504678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.490724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.481647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.363251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.334221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Substance intoxication","weight":0.319198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.30545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Dissociation","weight":0.269887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.174371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.162852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Psychomotor agitation","weight":0.13164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychomotor_agitation"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
