{"id":30298,"title":"Outlier populations: individual and social network correlates of solvent-using injection drug users.","abstract":"We previously identified a high prevalence of Hepatitis C (HCV) amongst solvent-using injection drug users (S-IDU) relative to other injection drug users within the same locality. Here we incorporated social network variables to better characterize some of the behavioural characteristics that may be putting this specific subgroup of IDU at elevated disease risk.A cross-sectional survey of at-risk populations was carried out in Winnipeg, Canada in 2009. Individuals reporting any history of injection drug and/or solvent use were included in the study. Associations between subgroup membership, infection with HCV and HIV and individual and social network variables were examined.In relation to other IDU, S-IDU were more likely to be infected with HCV, to report ever having shared a syringe, and to associate with other IDU. They were further differentiated in terms of their self-reported sexual orientation, ethnicity and in the injection drugs typically used.Solvent use stands as a proxy measure of numerous other characteristics that put this group of IDU at higher risk of infection. Provision of adequate services to ostracized subpopulations may result in wider population-level benefits.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24523923","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.705716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.696964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Sexual orientation","weight":0.657862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.634532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.634145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.585775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.540469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Winnipeg","weight":0.465406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg"},{"name":"Solvent","weight":0.451388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.424832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Syringe","weight":0.385745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringe"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.384761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.380921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Social network","weight":0.121708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Shunning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunning"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Outlier","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier"}]}
