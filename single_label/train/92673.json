{"id":92673,"title":"Forty-five cases of chest keloids treated with subcutaneous super-tension-reduction suture combined with postoperative electron-beam irradiation.","abstract":"Chest keloids are challenging to surgeons because of their high recurrence rate.To investigate the effectiveness of the subcutaneous super-tension-reduction suture technique with postoperative electron-beam irradiation in the treatment of chest keloids.Forty-five patients with chest keloids underwent excision. To minimize the wound-closing tension, subcutaneous super-tension-reduction suture was used. The maximum tension reduction was placed on both dermis and subcutaneous tissue, which were far away from the incision. The consequence of such suturing was that the wound edges were moved centrally to elevate them like a bump after tying the buried knot. All patients received fractionated electron-beam radiation therapy starting within 24 hours after surgery, in a 5-Gy dose daily for 3 to 4 consecutive days, to a total dose of 15 to 20 Gy.The wounds healed primarily in all 45 cases. The bump at the incision began to flatten out after 2 to 3 months and was almost completely flat by 12 months postoperatively. Only 1 case of relapse (2.2%) was observed within 2 years of follow-up examination.The use of subcutaneous super-tension-reduction suture after chest keloids excision can greatly decrease tension on the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue and can, in combination with postoperative electron-beam irradiation, decrease the rate of relapse.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25357171","annotations":[{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.84873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.707927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Keloid","weight":0.626043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.48543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.399321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.396424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.20613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Knot","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot"},{"name":"Flat racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_racing"},{"name":"Radiation hardening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening"}]}
