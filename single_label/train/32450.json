{"id":32450,"title":"Congenital malformations of pediatric surgical interest: prevalence, risk factors, and prenatal diagnosis between 2005 and 2012 in the capital city of a developing country. Bogot√°, Colombia.","abstract":"Congenital anomalies (CAs) cause nearly one third of infant deaths worldwide. Various surveillance systems have been established, such as the Bogota Congenital Malformations Surveillance Program (BCMSP). Some CAs are of special interest to pediatric surgeons: omphalocele, gastroschisis, intestinal and esophageal atresia, anorectal malformations, vascular anomalies, diaphragmatic hernias, hypospadias and cryptorchidism. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of such CAs, and identify possible risk factors.Data from the BCMSP were collected between January 2005 and April 2012. CAs were classified in accordance with the ICD-10 and grouped for analysis purposes. Data on CA frequencies were obtained from the BCMSP. Association analyses were performed using the case-control methodology.282,523 births were registered. 4682 (1.66%) had one or more CAs at birth. The prevalence of CAs requiring pediatric surgery was 1 in 1000. The most frequent CAs were vascular anomalies, hypospadias, and anorectal malformations. Exposure to external factors was significantly associated with selected CAs. 51% of selected birth defects were not diagnosed in prenatal ultrasound.This study highlights the importance of evaluating the local prevalence of congenital malformations. We propose the creation of specialized centers in Bogota to manage patients with CAs.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24952796","annotations":[{"name":"Cryptorchidism","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptorchidism"},{"name":"Hypospadias","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypospadias"},{"name":"Gastroschisis","weight":0.858244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroschisis"},{"name":"Esophageal atresia","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_atresia"},{"name":"Omphalocele","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalocele"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Prenatal diagnosis","weight":0.816036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pediatric surgery","weight":0.742055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_surgery"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.6473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.458563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Infant mortality","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.336774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Obstetric ultrasonography","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetric_ultrasonography"},{"name":"ICD-10","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Atresia","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atresia"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Capital city","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_city"},{"name":"Anorectal anomalies","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectal_anomalies"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"}]}
