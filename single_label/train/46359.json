{"id":46359,"title":"Hepatic angiosarcoma and liver transplant: a report of 2 cases with diagnostic difficulties.","abstract":"Angiosarcoma is a rare primary malignant mesenchymal tumor of the liver. The prognosis of hepatic angiosarcoma is poor with an average life expectancy of 6 months after diagnosis. Diagnosing hepatic angiosarcoma is challenging because of nondiagnostic liver biopsy or specious history and radiologic presentation. We report 2 cases with hepatic angiosarcoma which were diagnosed histopathologically in the native liver after liver transplant. One of 2 patients was lost to follow-up, and another patient died of relapsing hepatic angiosarcoma 18 months after the liver transplant.
