{"id":62291,"title":"[Effect of microRNA-17-92 cluster on the biological characteristics of K562 cells and its mechanisms].","abstract":"The objective of this study was to explore the effects of microRNA-17-92 on the biological characteristics of K562 cells. The expression of miR-17-92 in K562 cells transfected with miRNA-17-92 mimic was detected by real time PCR. The effect of microRNA-17-92 on K562 cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 method. Apoptosis of K562 cells was detected by Annexin V-PI labeling. Cell cycle distribution was determined by using flow cytometry. Western blot was performed to determine the protein levels of Crk. The results indicated that the transfection with miR-17-92 mimic increased expression of mature miR-17-92 in K562 cells. Compared with control group, cell proliferation and cell amount in S-phase of miR-17-92 mimic transfected group significantly increased, cell apoptosis decreased. The expression of signal connector protein Crk was greatly up-regulated in miR-17-92-mimic-transfected K562 cells. It is concluded that miR-17-92 can promote proliferation, inhibit apoptosis and regulate the cell cycle of K562 cells.
