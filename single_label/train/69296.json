{"id":69296,"title":"A simple reconstruction of the posterior aspect of rhabdosphincter and sparing of puboprostatic collar reduces the time to early continence after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.","abstract":"Incontinence is a drawback after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Several surgical methods to improve continence have been described however with contradictory results.To determine whether a modified surgical technique during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) improves postoperative continence.This is a prospective nonrandomized study with two consecutive series of 100 patients in each group. The first group from 2005 to 2008 underwent a standard LRP. The second group from 2009 to 2011 was subjected to a modified LRP by sparing of puboprostatic ligaments, including the preservation of arcus tendineous, and using a simple posterior tension-releasing suture adapting the urethra stump to the bladder before the anastomosis. The patients had the same preoperative work-up and comparable preoperative baseline characteristics. The 2-year follow-up of the patients included a continence questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Urinary peak flow (Qmax) and post-void residual (PVR) volume were assessed at 3 months. Continence was defined as 0-1 pad/day.Only 99 patients were evaluated in each group. The patients had comparable operative characteristics. The continence rates after the modified technique vs the standard were 33% vs 16%, p=0.007 at 1 month; 66% vs 44%, p=0.002 at 3 months; 81% vs 67%, p=0.034 at 6 months; 92% vs 80%, p=0.024 at 12 months; and 95% vs 86%, p=0.05 at 2 years. No significant differences were found regarding voiding functions, the Qmax, the PVR volume, or the IPSS. Three patients developed urethral stricture in the standard group compared with none in the modified group. The negative margin rates were unchanged.The anterior preservation and posterior suture technique studied is a simple, safe, and efficient method to shorten the time to continence after LRP without adverse effects on voiding or compromising the margin rates.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456218","annotations":[{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.914388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.826578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.654701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Sex reassignment surgery","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.593984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.338789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.253035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.185579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.118155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Collar (BDSM)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collar_(BDSM)"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}]}
