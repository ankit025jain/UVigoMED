{"id":78248,"title":"Intratympanic gentamicin as a treatment for drop attacks in patients with Meniere's disease.","abstract":"Vertigo attacks in most cases of Meniere's disease (MD) are successfully treated with lifestyle changes and medication. However, approximately 6% of patients with MD develop drop attacks (DAs), a potentially life-threatening condition. Traditional treatment for DAs has been surgical labyrinthectomy. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of intratympanic gentamicin for DAs in patients with MD.Retrospective charts review.All charts were reviewed from Meniere DA patients at our hospital during the 10-year period from 2002 to 2012 who had been treated with intratympanic gentamicin and had been followed for at least 1 year afterward.Twenty-four ears fulfilled inclusion criteria. The time for manifestation of DAs varied from 1 to 20 years after diagnosis (mean 10 years). A total of 83.3% of ears with intractable MD and DA achieved complete symptom control of DAs after the first intratympanic gentamicin cycle and 95.8% after the further injections. Among patients with no DA recurrence by the end of the study follow-up, the symptom-free interval varied from 12 to 120 months (mean: 43.5 months). All 15 patients with ? 24 months follow-up were still free of DAs. Elevated or absent vestibular evoked myogenic potential thresholds were more common in DA than in contralateral ears, and hearing loss was not a major complication of the treatment.Intratympanic gentamicin treatment appears to be a long-lasting and effective treatment for MD with DAs.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24729095","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.436608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.406604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.287882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.251242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.0574438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Absolute threshold of hearing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold_of_hearing"},{"name":"District attorney","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"Myogenic contraction","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myogenic_contraction"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Tradition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
