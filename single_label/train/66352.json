{"id":66352,"title":"Androgen-independent proliferation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells infected by xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus.","abstract":"Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is a novel gammaretrovirus that was originally isolated from human prostate cancer. It is now believed that XMRV is not the etiologic agent of prostate cancer. An analysis of murine leukemia virus (MLV) infection in various human cell lines revealed that prostate cancer cell lines are preferentially infected by XMRV, and this suggested that XMRV infection may confer some sort of growth advantage to prostate cancer cell lines. To examine this hypothesis, androgen-dependent LNCaP cells were infected with XMRV and tested for changes in certain cell growth properties. We found that XMRV-infected LNCaP cells can proliferate in the absence of the androgen dihydrotestosterone. Moreover, androgen receptor expression is significantly reduced in XMRV-infected LNCaP cells. Such alterations were not observed in uninfected and amphotropic MLV-infected LNCaP cells. This finding explains why prostate cancer cell lines are preferentially infected with XMRV.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721431","annotations":[{"name":"Dihydrotestosterone","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Murine leukemia virus","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murine_leukemia_virus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.712788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"LNCaP","weight":0.52408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNCaP"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.355557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.104058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"List of distinct cell types in the adult human body","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body"},{"name":"Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotropic_murine_leukemia_virus-related_virus"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Human T-lymphotropic virus","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_T-lymphotropic_virus"},{"name":"Gammaretrovirus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gammaretrovirus"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"}]}
