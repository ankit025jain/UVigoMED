{"id":42601,"title":"Role of c-Src activity in the regulation of gastric cancer cell migration.","abstract":"Gastric cancer is associated with increased migration and invasion. In the present study, we explored the role of c-Src in gastric cancer cell migration and invasion. BGC-823 gastric cancer cells were used to investigate migration following treatment of these cells with the c-Src inhibitors, PP2 and SU6656. Migration and invasion were analyzed by wound healing and Transwell assays. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of MT1-MMP and VEGF-C, while the activity of MMP2 and MMP9 was monitored with gelatin zymography assay. Immunoprecipitation was used to detect interactions among furin, pro-MT1-MMP and pro-VEGF-C. MT1-MMP and VEGF-C expression levels were inhibited by PP2 and SU6656 treatment, in accordance with decreased c-Src activity. Similarly, the zymography assay demonstrated that the activity of MMP2 and MMP9 was decreased following PP2 or SU6656 treatment. Blockade of c-Src also inhibited the invasive and migratory capacity of BGC-823 cells. Notably, c-Src interacted with furin in vivo, while interactions between furin and its substrates, pro-MT1-MMP and pro-VEGF-C, were decreased by c-Src inhibitors. In conclusion, the interaction among furin and pro-MT1-MMP or pro-VEGF-C or other tumor-associated precursor enzymes can be regulated by c-Src activity, thus reducing or changing the expression of these enzymes in order to reduce the development of gastric cancer, invasion and metastasis.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24841138","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Gelatin","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.730647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.594376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.473925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.365799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.345962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Furin","weight":0.329167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furin"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Immunoprecipitation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoprecipitation"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor C","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_C"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Protein phosphatase 2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_phosphatase_2"},{"name":"Bird migration","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
