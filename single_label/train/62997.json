{"id":62997,"title":"[Lymphoedema--diagnosis and treatment].","abstract":"Lymphoedema is a common complication of oncological treatment. Various methods of imaging are used in its diagnosing and monitoring. However, presently lymphoscintigraphy has become the golden standard. A physical examination and detailed medical history also play a very important role. There are still no effective methods of prevention and treatment of lymphoedema in spite of medical progress. The treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach with the use of various methods of physiotherapy (pressure therapy, pneumatic pumps and electric high-voltage treatment), pharmacology and surgery. Patient's education and suitable physical exercises are also significant.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490468","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.697067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.668297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.599803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.513143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Sentinel lymph node","weight":0.438373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_lymph_node"},{"name":"History","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.041581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Pneumatics","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Lymphedema","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"}]}
