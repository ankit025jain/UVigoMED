{"id":37974,"title":"Behavioral profile in RASopathies.","abstract":"Here, we describe neurobehavioral features in patients with RASopathies (i.e., Noonan syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome, Costello syndrome, and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome), developmental disorders caused by mutations in genes coding transducers participating in the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade. Parents of 70 individuals with a RASopathy were asked to fill out the following questionnaires: Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Social Communication Questionnaire version lifetime (SCQ-L), and Modified Checklist for Autism in toddlers (M-CHAT). Data analysis indicated high rates of internalizing (37%) and externalizing problems (31%) on CBCL. Scores over the cut-off were documented in 64% of patients with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, 44% with Costello syndrome, and 12% with Noonan syndrome on SCQ-L/M-CHAT. Our findings indicate that mutations promoting dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK cascade mark an increased psychopathological risk and highlight that autistic-like behavior could be underdiagnosed in patients with RASopathies.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24458522","annotations":[{"name":"Noonan syndrome","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noonan_syndrome"},{"name":"Autism","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.549404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Psychopathology","weight":0.446315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Developmental disorder","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disorder"},{"name":"Social communication","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_communication"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Toddler","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler"},{"name":"Internalization","weight":0.0523561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalization"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiofaciocutaneous_syndrome"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Emotional dysregulation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Costello syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costello_syndrome"},{"name":"Attachment measures","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_measures"},{"name":"LEOPARD syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEOPARD_syndrome"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Confidence trick","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick"},{"name":"Transducer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer"},{"name":"Costello","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costello"},{"name":"Scores New York (Gentlemen's club)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scores_New_York_(Gentlemen's_club)"},{"name":"Externalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externalization"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Noonan, North Dakota","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noonan,_North_Dakota"},{"name":"Biochemical cascade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_cascade"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"}]}
