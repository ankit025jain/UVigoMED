{"id":79469,"title":"[2 cases of pulsatile tinnitus caused by sigmoid sinus diverticulum and literature review].","abstract":"To describe the anatomy,radiographic manifestation, and surgical treatment of pulsatile tinnitus due to sigmoid sinus diverticulum.The retrospectively study of diagnosis,clinical and radiographic manifestations,and surgical treatment of 2 cases of pulsatile tinnitus caused by sigmoid sinus diverticulum was carried out.Bony defect was found in the anterior sigmoid wall in both cases, and one of them was combined with invasion of soft tissues in mastoid cells. Both of them undertook a surgery to reconstruct sinus wall and received a satisfactory results.Sigmoid sinus diverticulum is one of causes which lead to pulsatile tinnitus. It can be identified by imaging examination and can be cured by sinus wall reconstruction.","date":"2014-01-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417170","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.732558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.66425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tinnitus","weight":0.659258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.615082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.357917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diverticulum","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulum"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mastoid process","weight":0.0495716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_process"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Sigmoid sinus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_sinus"},{"name":"Mastoid cells","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_cells"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Pulsatile insulin","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsatile_insulin"}]}
