{"id":43351,"title":"Rectovestibular fistula with vaginal atresia: our experience and a proposed course of management.","abstract":"Rectovestibular fistula with coexisting vaginal atresia poses a surgical dilemma with regard to the timing and type of reconstruction. We present our experience and suggest an appropriate course of management.Seven patients with rectovestibular fistula and coexisting vestibular atresia were operated in our hospital during January 2004 through December 2013. The details of their bowel, menstrual and sexual functions were recorded.Five of the seven patients who underwent anoplasty in childhood presented to us in their teens with primary amenorrhea and cyclical abdominal pain. All five had sigmoid colon neovaginoplasty. Four of these had the uterus or its remnants anastomosed to the neovagina. All four have regular menstrual cycles. One patient is sexually active and has satisfactory sexual function. The bowel function in all the five patients is good. The remaining two patients presented in their infancy and had the anorectovestibular fistula left as the neovagina. The recto-sigmoid was pulled down to form the neoanus. Both these patients have bowel incontinence.We recommend the rectovestibular fistula be used as the neoanus and not as the neovagina. Delayed bowel vaginal replacement has excellent results and allows for optimal assessment of functioning uterine body or remnants.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793106","annotations":[{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Amenorrhoea","weight":0.860485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenorrhoea"},{"name":"Vaginoplasty","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginoplasty"},{"name":"Vaginal atresia","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_atresia"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.459055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Atresia","weight":0.430346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atresia"},{"name":"Sexual function","weight":0.243667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_function"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Sexual reproduction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
