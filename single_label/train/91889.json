{"id":91889,"title":"Delivery of growth factors using a smart porous nanocomposite scaffold to repair a mandibular bone defect.","abstract":"Implantation of a porous scaffold with a large volume into the body in a convenient and safe manner is still a challenging task in the repair of bone defects. In this study, we present a porous smart nanocomposite scaffold with a combination of shape memory function and controlled delivery of growth factors. The shape memory function enables the scaffold with a large volume to be deformed into its temporal architecture with a small volume using hot-compression and can subsequently recover its original shape upon exposure to body temperature after it is implanted in the body. The scaffold consists of chemically cross-linked poly(?-caprolactone) (c-PCL) and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. The highly interconnected pores of the scaffold were obtained using the sugar leaching method. The shape memory porous scaffold loaded with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) was also fabricated by coating the calcium alginate layer and BMP-2 on the surface of the pore wall. Under both in vitro and in vivo environmental conditions, the porous scaffold displays good shape memory recovery from the compressed shape with deformed pores of 33 ?m in diameter to recover its porous shape with original pores of 160 ?m in diameter. In vitro cytotoxicity based on the MTT test revealed that the scaffold exhibited good cytocompatibility. The in vivo micro-CT and histomorphometry results demonstrated that the porous scaffold could promote new bone generation in the rabbit mandibular bone defect. Thus, our results indicated that this shape memory porous scaffold demonstrated great potential for application in bone regenerative medicine.
