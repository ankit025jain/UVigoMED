{"id":88813,"title":"Continuous distal migration and internal rotation of the C-stem prosthesis without any adverse clinical effects: an RSA study of 33 primary total hip arthroplasties followed for up to ten years.","abstract":"In 2005, we demonstrated that the polished triple-tapered C-stem at two years had migrated distally and rotated internally. From that series, 33 patients have now been followed radiologically, clinically and by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) for up to ten years. The distal migration within the cement mantle had continued and reached a mean of 2 mm (0.5 to 4.0) at ten years. Internal rotation, also within the cement mantle, was a mean 3.8° (external 1.6° to internal 6.6°) The cement mantle did not show any sign of migration or loosening in relation to the femoral bone. There were no clinical or radiological signs indicating that the migration or rotation within the cement mantle had had any adverse effects for the patients.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788493","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.591466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.398053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.131169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.121662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.110465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Bird migration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration"},{"name":"Polishing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polishing"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Internal rotation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rotation"},{"name":"Emigration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigration"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Mantle (geology)","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)"}]}
