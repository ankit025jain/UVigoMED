{"id":67365,"title":"[Why, when and how to monitor new oral anticoagulants].","abstract":"Several direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now widely used in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events. Unlike vitamin K antagonists, DOACs exhibit predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. DOACs are to be administered at fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring. However, in some patient populations or specific clinical circumstances, measurement of drug exposure may be useful, such as in suspected overdose, in patients with a haemorrhagic or thromboembolic event during treatment with an anticoagulant, in those with acute renal failure, or in patients who require urgent surgery. This article provides practical guidance on laboratory testing of DOACs in routine practice and summarizes the influence of DOACs on commonly used coagulation assays.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624625","annotations":[{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.882746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.703857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.550455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.481252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vitamin K","weight":0.372222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_K"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.365899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.329395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.249442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.178263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"}]}
