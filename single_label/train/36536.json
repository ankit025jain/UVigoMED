{"id":36536,"title":"Does early tetralogy of Fallot total correction give better final lung volumes?","abstract":"Pulmonary blood flow may affect lung development in adulthood. Early total correction of tetralogy of Fallot may affect development of final lung volumes. We evaluated the effect of age at total correction on lung volumes years after the operation.In a retrospective cohort study on patients with totally corrected tetralogy of Fallot (mean age, 13.40 years at the time of follow-up), forced vital capacity, slow vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and other parameters were measured 154.8?±?46.25 months after the operation. Comparison were made of 3 groups: ?2-, 2-8-, and >8-years old at the time of total correction surgery.Among 322 enrolled patients, the mean values of the follow-up spirometry results in ?2-, 2-8-, >8-year-olds and the percentage of predicted values were respectively: vital capacity: 4.46?±?0.57?L (107%?±?10.96%), 3.89?±?0.58?L (91.10%?±?12.25%), 3.25?±?0.48?L (82.35%?±?10.62%), p?<?0.001; forced vital capacity: 4.28?±?0.63?L (95.90%?±?18.77%), 3.76?±?0.58?L (90.83%?±?12.52%), 3.14?±?0.49?L (83.26%?±?11.71%), p?<?0.001; forced expiratory volume in 1 s: 4.22?±?0.63?L (104.84%?±?13.64%), 3.66?±?0.58?L (90.61%?±?12.59%), 3.02?±?0.48?L (84.31%?±?12%), p?<?0.001.Early correction of defects or reestablishments of perfusion of tetralogy of Fallot before completion of lung development might improve final adulthood lung volumes and capacities. It is better to consider total correction for all tetralogy of Fallot patients below 2-years old, or at least below 8-years old, if it is technically possible.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570491","annotations":[{"name":"Lung","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.755649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.509059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.435916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tetralogy of Fallot","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.204754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Lung volumes","weight":0.171124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_volumes"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.115174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Vital capacity","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_capacity"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Tetralogy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"846","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/846"},{"name":"1012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1012"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"890","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/890"},{"name":"27th century","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27th_century"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"3112","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3112"}]}
