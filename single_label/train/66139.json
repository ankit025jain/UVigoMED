{"id":66139,"title":"[Psychological experiences and coping strategies of children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease on renal replacement therapy].","abstract":"Children, adolescents and young adults with end-stage renal disease need a renal replacement therapy (dialysis) or a renal transplant to survive. The dialysis is related to a very complex care, which includes invasive and painful procedures. Chronic diseases have a strong influence not only on the physical but also on the psychological development of children and adolescents. The most important psychological consequences include social isolation, differences in body image, limited lifestyle, as well as the changed personal relationships with family and friends. Therefore, caregivers should also have knowledge about the psychological consequences, being able to provide adequate help and support to children, adolescents and young adults.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741813","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.718362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.704798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.603714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.574286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.486601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.420466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Body image","weight":0.409146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.348449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.114803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Social isolation","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_isolation"},{"name":"Developmental psychology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.0703369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Renal replacement therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
