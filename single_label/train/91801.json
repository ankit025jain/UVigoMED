{"id":91801,"title":"Management of delayed suprachoriodal haemorrhage after intraocular surgery and trauma.","abstract":"[corrected] To indentify surgical risk factors for delayed suprachoroidal haemorrhage (DSCH) and to report the outcomes of an effective intervention in a consecutive of patients.The clinical data of ten patients diagnosed with DSCH in our hospital between July 2007 and December 2012 were extracted from hospital records and analyzed, including ophthalmologic examination, ophthalmologic ultrasonography, surgical procedures, and outcome measures including visual acuity and intraocular pressure.Ten eyes of ten patients including six men and four women with mean age of 56.6?±?17.67 years, with DSCH, were enrolled. After diagnosis, drainage or/and pars plana vitrectomy were performed for eight patients; another two received conservative treatment. All the patients were followed up for 15.2?±?4.3 months. Intraocular pressure decreased significantly (p?<?0.001); the mean final visual acuity improved significantly after intervention (p?<?0.001).We emphasized other great risk factors such as intraoperative mitomycin-C use, systemic anticoagulation or thrombolysis, and chronic kidney disease. It seems that earlier surgical intervention after the diagnosis of DSCH will be beneficial to patients by improving their final visual acuity.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473672","annotations":[{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.848185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Thrombolysis","weight":0.793174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombolysis"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.696813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.612944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Eye surgery","weight":0.565883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_surgery"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.314783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.302215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.251026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
