{"id":53304,"title":"The pancreatic ?-cell transcriptome and integrated-omics.","abstract":"? Cells represent one of many cell types in heterogeneous pancreatic islets and play the central role in maintaining glucose homeostasis, such that disrupting ?-cell function leads to diabetes. This review summarizes the methods for isolating and characterizing ? cells, and describes integrated 'omics' approaches used to define the ? cell by its transcriptome and proteome.RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based protein identification have now identified RNA and protein profiles for mouse and human pancreatic islets and ? cells, and for ?-cell lines. Recent publications have outlined these profiles and, more importantly, have begun to assign the presence or absence of specific genes and regulatory molecules to ?-cell function and dysfunction. Overall, researchers have focused on understanding the pathophysiology of diabetes by connecting genome, transcriptome, proteome, and regulatory RNA profiles with findings from genome-wide association studies.Studies employing these relatively new techniques promise to identify specific genes or regulatory RNAs with altered expression as ?-cell function begins to deteriorate in the spiral toward the development of diabetes. The ultimate goal is to identify the potential therapeutic targets to prevent ?-cell dysfunction and thereby better treat the individual with diabetes.http://links.lww.com/COE/A5.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526012","annotations":[{"name":"Proteome","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteome"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Transcriptome","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Non-coding RNA","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.639535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.562319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Cis-regulatory element","weight":0.25518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cis-regulatory_element"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.254482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Helix","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix"},{"name":"Omics","weight":0.119278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omics"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Integrase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrase"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
