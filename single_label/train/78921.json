{"id":78921,"title":"Expanded selection criteria in adult cochlear implantation.","abstract":"Cochlear implantation has become the standard procedure for restoring substantial hearing in the profoundly deaf. The excellent performance of most of the CI recipients coupled with the rapid evolution of implant technology lead to a distinct expansion in selection criteria for CI. These changes in candidacy primarily include patients with (1) moderate preoperative speech recognition with hearing aids, (2) significant residual hearing, (3) single-sided deafness, and (4) geriatric patients. Many of these patients' conditions were regarded as a clear contraindication to CI only a few years ago. In this article an overview of the current and new aspects of candidacy for cochlear implantation is provided.
