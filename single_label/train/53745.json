{"id":53745,"title":"Predicting the outcome of platinum-based chemotherapies in epithelial ovarian cancer using the 8092C/A polymorphism of ERCC1: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"In the present study, we performed this meta-analysis to estimate the association between excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) gene polymorphism and clinical resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in the patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).A total of 10 studies consist of 1479 EOC patients relating ERCC1 rs11615C/T and rs3212986C/A polymorphisms to the response of platinum-based chemotherapy were included in this meta-analysis.The analysis showed that the AA genotype of the rs3212986C/A polymorphism in ERCC1 was associated with progression-free survival of EOC patients (HR?=?1.39, 95% CI?=?1.12-1.73) and that the CA or AA genotypes could influence overall survival (HR?=?1.28, 95% CI?=?1.05-1.56; and HR?=?1.55, 95% CI?=?1.17?2.05, respectively).The ERCC1 rs3212986C/A polymorphism may be a useful prognostic marker in platinum-based treatment of EOC.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499239","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.738551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.72334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.683469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.670495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.411184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.36434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"ERCC1","weight":0.327293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERCC1"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"CI1 fossils","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI1_fossils"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1479","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1479"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Excision repair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excision_repair"},{"name":"Croatian Radiotelevision","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Radiotelevision"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"The Automobile Association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Automobile_Association"}]}
