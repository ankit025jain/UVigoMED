{"id":77558,"title":"An analysis of gender differences in patients with hand eczema?-?everyday exposures, severity, and consequences.","abstract":"Hand eczema is often related to high-risk occupations and aggravating exposures in everyday life. The disease is twice as frequent in women as in men, partly because of diverse exposure patterns. Other gender differences may be relevant for treatment and prevention.To gain insights into the common features and differences between men and women with hand eczema.The clinical disease severity of patients (n?=?306) attending for dermatological treatment at two settings was assessed with the Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI). Self-reported medication adherence, aggravating factors, hand eczema-related consequences and quality of life were obtained from a questionnaire.Men and women had equal clinical severities of disease, with an overall median HECSI of 43. Self-reported medication adherence was equal between the genders, but, among patients aged >?40?years, more reported higher adherence. The impact of disease was larger in women than in men. Women reported significantly more aggravating factors and sick leave. Also, women had a more impaired quality of life than men at equal levels of disease severity, and this could be associated with the higher number of aggravating factors.Gender differences in hand eczema need to be considered in the dermatological treatment and counselling of patients.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618009","annotations":[{"name":"Gender","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.752466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.603266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Sex differences in humans","weight":0.310508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.27769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Eczema","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.186716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0388964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Personal life","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life"},{"name":"Sick leave","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_leave"},{"name":"306","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/306"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Hand (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_(comics)"},{"name":"Aggravation (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggravation_(law)"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"},{"name":"Frustration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustration"}]}
