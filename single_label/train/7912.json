{"id":7912,"title":"[Effects of sacral canal injection on nerve root local inflammatory factors in rat model with lumbar disc herniation].","abstract":"To explore the effects of sacral canal injection on nerve root local inflammatory factors in rat model with lumbar disc herniation, in order to identify its mechanism of treatment.Forty-eight male SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation group(group A), model group (group B), Chinese medicine group(group C) and western medicine group(group D). There were 12 rats in each group. The model of lumbar disc herniation was established using compression and inflammatory stimulation in group B, C, D. All rats were given epidural catheterization and group A and B with physiological saline (1 ml/kg), group C with mixed liquor of 2% lidocaine and compound Danshen injections and physiological saline (2:2: 16) and group D with mixed liquor of 2% lidocaine and triamcinolone acetonide injection and physiological saline (2:2:16), once a week for a total of three treatments. Four rats were killed every 1 week after injection for once, and the inflammatory factors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin-l (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were detected by ELISA method.The levels of TNF-alpha, PGE2, IL-1 and IL-6 in compressed nerve tissues in group B were increased than those of group A (P < 0.01). The levels of PGE2, IL-1 and IL-6 in group C and D were decreased than those of group B, and group D was much less(P<0.05). There was no significant difference in level of TNF-alpha among group B, C, D (P > 0.05).Compound compression with inflammatory stimulation can lead to massive release of inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-alpha, PGE2, IL-1 and IL-6. Both injection with compound Danshen injections and triamcinolone acetonide injections by sacral canal can reduce the levels of part inflammatory mediators (PGE2, IL-1 and IL-6), and the effect of Glucocorticoid is better than Danshen (P < 0.05).","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Animal
