{"id":79680,"title":"[The epidemiology of malaria in Bursa--2009-2012].","abstract":"Malaria is a common disease in many tropical and subtropical areas, which may threaten life. In this study, we examined the epidemiology of malaria in Bursa province using the data provided by the Province Health Directorate, collected over 2009 to 2012.The data include a total of 29.683 blood samples taken by active and passive surveillance. Giemsa-stained thin and thick blood smears were examined with a 100X oil immersion objective using a standard microscope.A total of 21 (0.07%) malaria cases were detected. Of these, 20 (95.2%) cases were male and 1 (4.8%) case was female, with highest rates occurring in June and September. All of the cases were imported, of whom 10 (47.6%) were caused by Plasmodium vivax and 11 (52.4%) by P. falciparum. All P. falciparum cases were found to be imported cases that traveled to African nations (CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Sudan, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Somalia). Malaria cases were mainly observed in the 15-to-44-year-old range.We believe that these results will lead to better-targeted and more effective malaria control programs.","date":"2014-07-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016112","annotations":[{"name":"Equatorial Guinea","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_Guinea"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Senegal","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal"},{"name":"Somalia","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia"},{"name":"Mali","weight":0.874928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali"},{"name":"Sudan","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Guinea","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.721221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.703062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.523377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.506572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Subtropics","weight":0.406078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.318158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.289775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.247451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.154061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.14902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Bursa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursa"},{"name":"Baptism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Smear campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Flag","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
