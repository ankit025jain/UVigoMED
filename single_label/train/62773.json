{"id":62773,"title":"Pattern of subcutaneous fat during follow-up of a cohort of North Indian children with Kawasaki disease: a preliminary study.","abstract":"Kawasaki disease (KD) has been associated with abnormal lipid profiles. The latter, in turn, have been linked to changes in subcutaneous fat. In this comparative cross-sectional study we have quantified distribution of subcutaneous fat during follow-up of a cohort of North Indian children with KD.We compared 35 KD children (at least 2 years after disease) and 33 healthy controls. Study parameters included weight, height and skinfold thickness (SFT) over biceps, triceps, midaxillary, subscapular, medial calf and suprailiac areas. Waist and hip circumferences were also recorded. All parameters were measured four times at 6-monthly intervals using standardized techniques. Serum lipids were assayed in the study group.Study children were enrolled 3.7 ± 2.5 years after KD and mean age at enrolment was 8.26 ± 3.65 years. Suprailiac SFT measured higher in boys with KD (P ? 0.05). Biceps SFT was higher in the study group, but the difference was not significant. Other SFT were not affected. Waist and hip circumference was higher in the study group than controls (P ? 0.05). Waist/hip circumference ratio was not affected. Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides were higher in the study group as compared to historical controls (95.60 ± 36.12 and 129.40 ± 64.62 mg/dL vs. 80.10 ± 2.20 and 91.1 ± 29.85; P ? 0.05). Total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels remained unaffected.Children with KD (especially boys) had increased subcutaneous fat deposition in the suprailiac region and waist, during follow-up. Serum LDL-C and triglycerides were elevated. KD children may have a tendency to develop central obesity. Further studies, with longer follow-up, would be necessary to show whether this has implications for development of coronary artery disease later in life.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517191","annotations":[{"name":"Abdominal obesity","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"},{"name":"Body fat percentage","weight":0.848144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.83179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.819817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.717082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.571178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.408756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Kawasaki disease","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_disease"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Triceps brachii muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceps_brachii_muscle"},{"name":"Calf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Native Americans in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"North India","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Biceps brachii muscle","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biceps_brachii_muscle"}]}
