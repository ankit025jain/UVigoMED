{"id":59289,"title":"Expression and effects of high-mobility group box 1 in cervical cancer.","abstract":"We investigated the significance of high- mobility group box1 (HMGB1) and T-cell-mediated immunity and prognostic value in cervical cancer. HMGB1, forkhead/winged helix transcription factor p3 (Foxp3), IL-2, and IL-10 protein expression was analyzed in 100 cervical tissue samples including cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and healthy control samples using immunohistochemistry. Serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) was immunoradiometrically measured in 32 serum samples from 37 cases of squamous cervical cancer. HMGB1 and SCC-Ag were then correlated to clinicopathological characteristics. HMGB1 expression tends to increase as cervical cancer progresses and it was found to be significantly correlated to FIGO stage and lymph node metastasis. These findings suggest that HMGB1 may be a useful prognostic indicator of cervical carcinoma. In addition, there were significant positive relationships between HMGB1 and FOXP3 or IL-10 expression (both p<0.05). In contrast, HMGB1 and IL-2 expression was negatively correlated (p<0.05). HMGB1 expression may activate Tregs or facilitate Th2 polarization to promote immune evasion of cervical cancer. Elevated HMGB1 protein in cervical carcinoma samples was associated with a high recurrence of HPV infection in univariate analysis (p<0.05). HMGB1 expression and levels of SCC-Ag were directly correlated in SCC (p<0.05). Thus, HMGB1 may be a useful biomarker for patient prognosis and cervical cancer prediction and treatment.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837834","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_intraepithelial_neoplasia"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.867542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Gynecology_and_Obstetrics"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.809257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.798635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.628903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.623007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0846203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Helix","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
