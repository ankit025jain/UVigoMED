{"id":37766,"title":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia: structural challenges and stem cell treatment potential.","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for premature infants. Currently, most treatment strategies are mainly palliative and do not address the underlying structural changes of the lungs leading to the symptoms. New research and ongoing experiments with mesenchymal stem cells are showing capabilities to mitigate structural damage and promote vascular growth that leads to normal lung architecture in animal models. Looking at the pathophysiology that contributes to BPD and assessing current treatment options available, there still appears to be a gap in treatment that addresses the structural issues within the lungs. This article reviews the findings of several mesenchymal stem cell experiments and the potential for future treatment to help repair the lungs in infants with BPD.
