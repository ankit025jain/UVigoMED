{"id":78523,"title":"Cochlear implantation in a patient with Paget's disease.","abstract":"Paget's disease of the temporal bone can cause hearing loss that eventually develops into profound deafness. However, the treatment options for hearing loss associated with Paget's disease are limited. Thus far, only 3 cases of cochlear implantation in patients with Paget's disease have been reported. In this study, we describe a 62-year-old woman who underwent cochlear implantation for progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The patient gained useful open-set speech perception over a 5-year postoperative period. Cochlear implantation can be beneficial in patients with profound hearing loss associated with Paget's disease.
