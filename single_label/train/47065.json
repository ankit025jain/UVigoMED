{"id":47065,"title":"[Detection and analysis of HBV in polymorphonuclear neutrophils of patients with hepatitis B].","abstract":"To study the infection and replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in polymorphonuclear neutrophils of the patients with chronic hepatitis B.The neutrophils were isolated and purified by neutrophil isolation medium, and the loads of HBV-DNA in neutrophils were detected by PCR.Positive detection rate of HBV-DNA in neutrophils of chronic hepatitis B patients was 30.95% (13/42), and among them, the HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative ones were 52.94% (9/17) and 16.00%(4/25), respectively. After treatment of adefovir, the positive rate of HBV-DNA in neutrophils of chronic hepatitis B patients was 9.52% (4/42), and among them, the HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative ones were 17.65%(3/17) and 4.00%(1/25), respectively. There were significantly different positive rates in the patients before and after treatment (P<0.05).HBV can infect the neutrophils of the patients with chronic hepatitis B to achieve extrahepatic occult infection. Adefovir has a good inhibitory effect against the latent or hidden HBV in neutrophils.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606751","annotations":[{"name":"Adefovir","weight":0.89756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adefovir"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.748291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.628353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.418003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.119691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Occult","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1342","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1342"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"}]}
