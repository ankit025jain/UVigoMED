{"id":38628,"title":"[Role of procalcitonin in the diagnosis of early neonatal infection].","abstract":"To limit the regulation of antibiotherapy in neonatal early infections by improving the tracking and the diagnosis of infected newborns.First part: analysis of procalcitonin (PCT) in the cord. Method of tracking: 87 cases. Cut-off PCT=0.5 ng/mL. Measurement of CRP at 24 h if PCT>0.5 ng/mL. Second part: analysis of the PCT between 4 h and 6 h in the event of infectious risk; 47 cases over 6 months. Cut-off PCT=2 ng/mL. Measurement of CRP at 12 h and/or 24 h.In 2012, there were 10 antibiotherapies prescribed per 1000 births versus 30/1000 in 2011. A reduction in two thirds of the indications was seen.Markers of inflammation, i.e., the PCT (good specificity and good negative predictive value from 0 to 6 h of life) and CRP (good sensitivity and good positive predictive value from 12 to 24 of life) should be combined in time.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411569","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.682034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.359464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.297559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.274617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.123079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Porphyria cutanea tarda","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyria_cutanea_tarda"},{"name":"Tracking (hunting)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_(hunting)"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home"}]}
