{"id":84718,"title":"[The effect of treatment of chrysotile with chloride iron (III) on the effect of genomic instability in cultured human lymphocytes].","abstract":"All forms of asbestos are carcinogenic to humans, that caused the prohibition of its use in Europe, America, etc. However, the unique physical and chemical properties of asbestos and many opportunities for its applications in various industries and human activities require the creation of new technologies to. Analysis of genomic instability in human lymphocytes in a large range of doses (micronucleus test with cytochalasin B showed a decline of core indicators of genome instability (frequency of dividing cells with cytogenetic damage, asymmetry in the distribution of the genetic material in mitosis, proliferative activity) incubation of cells with asbestos modified chloride iron, as compared to the initial sample. These data are consistent with the results of analysis of the intensity of neutrophil chemiluminescence of luminol by exposure of human blood samples studied. Based on the findings made some practical recommendations to the protocol cytogenetic analysis of genomic instability of people exposed to asbestos.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Pathological
