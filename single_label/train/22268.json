{"id":22268,"title":"Non-invasive, epicutaneous immunisation with toxoid in deformable vesicles protects mice against tetanus, chiefly owing to a Th2 response.","abstract":"A non-invasive, intra/transcutaneous immunisation of mice with a suitable combination of tetanus toxoid, ultradeformable vesicle (Transfersome®) carrier, and monophosphoryl lipid A adjuvant targets immuno-competent cells in a body and can protect 100% of the tested mice against an otherwise lethal (50×LD50) parenteral tetanus toxin challenge. The late immune response to the epicutaneously applied tetanus toxoid in such vesicles consists chiefly of circulating IgG1 and IgG2b antibody isotypes, indicative of a specific Th2 cellular response bias. Immunisations by subcutaneous injections moreover protect 100% of mice against a similar, otherwise lethal, dose of tetanus toxin. However, the immune response to transcutaneous and invasive immunisation differs. The latter elicits mainly IgG1 and IgG2b as well as IgG2a antibody isotypes, indicative of a mixed Th1/Th2 response. The cytokine response of the intra/transcutaneously and subcutaneously immunised mice reflects the difference in the organ-specific manner. IFN-? concentration is appreciably increased in the draining lymph nodes and IL-10 in spleen. Since tetanus is a neutral antigen, both the Th1-specific IFN-? and the Th-2 specific-IL-10 are observable.
