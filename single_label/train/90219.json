{"id":90219,"title":"H-reflexes reduce fatigue of evoked contractions after spinal cord injury.","abstract":"Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) over a muscle belly (mNMES) generates contractions predominantly through M-waves, while NMES over a nerve trunk (nNMES) can generate contractions through H-reflexes in people who are neurologically intact. We tested whether the differences between mNMES and nNMES are present in people with chronic motor-complete spinal cord injury and, if so, whether they influence contraction fatigue.Plantar-flexion torque and soleus electromyography were recorded from 8 participants. Fatigue protocols were delivered using mNMES and nNMES on separate days.nNMES generated contractions that fatigued less than mNMES. Torque decreased the least when nNMES generated contractions, at least partly through H-reflexes (n?=?4 participants; 39% decrease), and torque decreased the most when contractions were generated through M-waves, regardless of NMES site (nNMES 71% decrease, n?=?4; mNMES, 73% decrease, n?=?8).nNMES generates contractions that fatigue less than mNMES, but only when H-reflexes contribute to the evoked contractions.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24638882","annotations":[{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.684672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.447016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Soleus muscle","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soleus_muscle"},{"name":"Functional electrical stimulation","weight":0.382194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_electrical_stimulation"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.278525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Electrical muscle stimulation","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_muscle_stimulation"},{"name":"Torque","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Uterine contraction","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_contraction"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
