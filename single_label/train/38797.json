{"id":38797,"title":"Modern surgical management of patients with tetralogy of Fallot.","abstract":"Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic heart defect seen in children beyond infancy. There is considerable variation in surgical management today ranging from differences in timing of complete repair versus initial use of a shunt for palliation, and methods for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction. This article will examine some of the current surgical management techniques for patients with Tetralogy of Fallot.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401265","annotations":[{"name":"Tetralogy of Fallot","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot"},{"name":"Cyanotic heart defect","weight":0.849187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanotic_heart_defect"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Cyanosis","weight":0.751213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanosis"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Ventricular outflow tract","weight":0.490664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_outflow_tract"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.307366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Tetralogy","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Outflow (meteorology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outflow_(meteorology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
