{"id":64758,"title":"[Two-micron laser resection of the prostate-tangerine technique for the treatment of large-volume prostate].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical efficiency and safety of two-micron laser resection of the prostate-tangerine technique (TmLRP-TT) for the treatment of large-volume ( > 70 ml) prostate in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).This retrospective analysis included 80 BPH patients with the prostatic volume larger than 70 ml, all treated by TmLRP-TT. We comparatively analyzed the levels of hemoglobin and serum sodium before and after surgery, recorded intra- and post-operative com- plications, and followed up the patients at 6 and 12 months after operation for International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL), maximum flow rate (Qmax), and postvoid residual urine volume (PVR).All the operations were successfully completed. The mean hemoglobin decreased (0.68 +/- 0.43) g/dl intraoperatively, but no apparent reduction was observed in serum sodium. Lower urinary tract symptoms were relieved significantly in all the cases. At 12 months after surgery, IPSS was decreased by 73.89% as compared with the baseline (20.03 +/- 6.9 vs 5.23 +/- 3.59), QOL by 64.55% (4.09 +/- 1.19 vs 1.45 +/- 1.36), and PVR by 79.30% (97.31 +/- 57.90 vs 20.14 +/- 24.20 ml), while Qmax increased by 140.42% ([8.04 +/- 3.62] vs [19.33 +/- 3.28] ml/s). The incidence of complications was low either intraoperatively or during the 12 months after operation.TmLRP-TT is a safe and effective surgical endoscopic approach to the treatment of large-volume prostate in BPH patients.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306807","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.845744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.840788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.662436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.617784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.579824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.373852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0930287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Lower urinary tract symptoms","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_urinary_tract_symptoms"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
