{"id":51287,"title":"The sympathetic neural hyperalgesia/edema syndrome, a common cause of female pelvic pain, manifesting as a pseudopheochromocytoma with marked clinical improvement with sympathomimetic amines.","abstract":"To show that a common but not well-known disorder of the sympathetic nervous system can present with symptoms suggesting a pheochromocytoma.The standard treatment of this disorder (which is characterized by an abnormal water load test), i.e., sympathomimetic amine therapy, was given to a woman with paroxysmal tachycardia and hypertension.Over a period of six months, the treatment eradicated the paroxysmal symptoms to which all other therapies had failed.This condition recently named as sympathetic neural hyperalgesia edema syndrome can present with symptoms of a pheochromocytoma and will respond to therapy with low dosages of dextroamphetamine sulfate.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707689","annotations":[{"name":"Pheochromocytoma","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheochromocytoma"},{"name":"Dextroamphetamine","weight":0.88077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.86265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Sympathomimetic drug","weight":0.85303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathomimetic_drug"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.781177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Hyperalgesia","weight":0.754552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.224581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Paroxysmal attack","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_attack"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Pelvic pain","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_pain"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"}]}
