{"id":34764,"title":"Haemoptysis from a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation in a post molar pregnancy gestational trophoblast tumour patient managed by radiological embolisation: a case report.","abstract":"Gestational trophoblastic tumours are a rare form of malignancy, which in the majority of cases arise from abnormal trophoblast cells formed in a complete molar pregnancy. These tumours are extremely sensitive to chemotherapy and high cure rates approaching 100% can be expected. The disease is usually limited to the uterus where the abnormal trophoblast proliferation and human chorionic production can lead to vascular changes including the formation of arteriovenous malformations.We describe the case of a 28-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to the United Kingdom's Gestational Trophoblast Tumour Service with rising human chorionic gonadotropin levels following a uterine evacuation for a complete molar pregnancy. She was commenced on chemotherapy but subsequently reported two episodes of haemoptysis. Computed tomography imaging demonstrated findings consistent with a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, probably due to a small pulmonary metastasis, complicated by recent haemorrhage. These findings were confirmed on emergency pulmonary arteriography, and the pulmonary arteriovenous malformation was successfully embolised.Arteriovenous malformations secondary to gestational trophoblastic tumours at metastatic sites have only been reported in a very limited number of cases. When significant bleeding occurs, as in this case of a pulmonary lesion, urgent referral for embolisation is indicated.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708611","annotations":[{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.903277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Hemoptysis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.818551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.803965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Trophoblast","weight":0.796792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophoblast"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hydatidiform mole","weight":0.763874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydatidiform_mole"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.740884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.680581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.626444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.613936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.512631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.475373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.318918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.14993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"}]}
