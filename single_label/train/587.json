{"id":587,"title":"Diphtheria outbreak in Thailand, 2012; seroprevalence of diphtheria antibodies among Thai adults and its implications for immunization programs.","abstract":"An age distribution shift in diphtheria cases during a 2012 outbreak in northeastern of Thailand suggests adults are increasingly at risk for infection in Thailand. Data regarding immunity against diphtheria among the adult Thai population is limited. We review a 2012 diphtheria outbreak in Thailand and conducted a nationwide seroepidemiological survey to determine the prevalence of diphtheria antibodies among Thai adults in order to inform immunization programs. A total of 41 confirmed cases, 6 probable cases and 101 carriers of diphtheria were reported from northeastern and upper southern Thailand. The diphtheria outbreak in northeastern Thailand occurred among adults aged > or =15 years; sporadic cases occurred among children from upper southern Thailand. We conducted a seroepidemiological survey of 890 Thai adults from 4 age groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49 and 50-59 years) in 7 different geographical areas of Thailand (Chiang Mai, Ratchaburi, Chon Buri, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Phitsanulok, Khon Kaen and Songkhla). Diptheria toxin antibody levels were measured with a commercially available ELISA test. The seroprotection rate ranged from 83% to 99%, with the highest in eastern Thailand (Chon Buri, 99%) and the lowest in northern Thailand (Chiang Mai, 83%). Diphtheria antibodies declined with increasing age. We recommend one doseof diphtheria-tetanus toxoid (dT) vaccine once after 20 years of age in order to boost the antibody and revaccinations every 10 years to prevent future outbreaks.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417516","annotations":[{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Nakhon Si Thammarat","weight":0.677229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhon_Si_Thammarat"},{"name":"Songkhla","weight":0.558028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songkhla"},{"name":"Chonburi Province","weight":0.552709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chonburi_Province"},{"name":"Chiang Mai","weight":0.547422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Mai"},{"name":"Phitsanulok","weight":0.542162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phitsanulok"},{"name":"Khon Kaen Province","weight":0.437543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khon_Kaen_Province"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.373713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Ratchaburi Province","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchaburi_Province"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.314973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.304061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Diphtheria","weight":0.265579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.244571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Southern Thailand","weight":0.169985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Thailand"},{"name":"Demographics of Thailand","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Thailand"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Isan","weight":0.0347418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isan"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Northern Thailand","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Thailand"},{"name":"Central Thailand","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Thailand"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Dance in Thailand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_in_Thailand"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Toxoid","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoid"},{"name":"Monarch","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch"},{"name":"Silicon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"}]}
