{"id":90813,"title":"[Osteoconductive behaviour of beta-tricalcium phosphate ceramics in osteoporotic, metaphyseal bone defects of the distal radius].","abstract":"Surgical treatment of osteoporotic distal radius fractures with locking plates does not completely prevent loss of reduction. Additional bone deficit stabilisation with the use of bone substitute materials is receiving increased attention. Most knowledge on the in vivo behavior of bone substitutes originates from a small number of animal models after its implantation in young, good vascularized bone.This paper investigates the osteoconductivity, resorption and biocompatibility of beta-tricalcium phosphate as a temporary bone replacement in osteoporotic type distal radius fractures.15 bone samples taken from the augmented area of the distal radius of elderly people during metal removal were examined.The material was found to be osteoconductive, good degradable, and biocompatible. Degrading process and remodelling to woven bone seem to require more time than in available comparative bioassays.The material is suitable for temporary replacement of lost, distal radius bone from the histological point of view.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573825","annotations":[{"name":"Biocompatibility","weight":0.811032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocompatibility"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.753378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.728326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.676915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.664358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.660403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.649722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.622042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.538817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.518573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.494708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Ceramic","weight":0.458494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.443093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.290324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Radius (bone)","weight":0.277753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_(bone)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.215536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.21264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Metaphysis","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysis"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.167108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Weaving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving"},{"name":"Substitute (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Bioassay","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioassay"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Narrative mode","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_mode"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"}]}
