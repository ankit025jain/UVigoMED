{"id":35972,"title":"Eruca sativa and its flavonoid components, quercetin and isorhamnetin, improve skin barrier function by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-? and suppression of inflammatory cytokines.","abstract":"Atopic dermatitis, which is related to dermatologic disorders and is associated with skin barrier dysfunction, represents an epidemic problem demanding effective therapeutic strategies. In the present study, we showed that the treatment with Eruca sativa extract resulted in a significant increase in the transactivation activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) response element such as PPAR-? and suppression in the expression of inflammatory cytokine and antimicrobial peptides. In addition, E. sativa extract promotes the expression of filaggrin related to skin barrier protection. Quercetin and isorhamnetin, flavonoids' constituents of E. sativa, also promoted PPAR-? activity. These results indicate that E. sativa extract may be an appropriate material for improving skin barrier function as a skin therapeutic agent for atopic dermatitis.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610745","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Quercetin","weight":0.723868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Peroxisome","weight":0.673817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.600895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.577993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor","weight":0.499795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor"},{"name":"Antimicrobial peptides","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_peptides"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.357706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.212202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Transactivation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactivation"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Alfalfa","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfalfa"},{"name":"Response element","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_element"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"}]}
