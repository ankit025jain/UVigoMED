{"id":88451,"title":"[Cases of non-fatal chop wounds to the head].","abstract":"Chop wounds, due to the fact that they are usually located on the head and are inflicted by a weapon or an object with a large mass, usually lead to death from an extensive damage to the skull and brain structures. Non-lethal chop wounds to the head are found very rarely in forensic practice. The following paper presents three cases, in which the occurrence of wounds has been attributed to the use of an axe. In the first case, the sustained injuries actually resulted in a life-threatening condition. The injuries in the second case bore attributes of exposure to direct danger to life and health within the meaning of the relevant article of the Criminal Code. The third case can be considered interesting, not only because of the nature of the suffered post-traumatic lesions, but also in view of the circumstances of the death of the victim occurring later on in life.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847640","annotations":[{"name":"Brain","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Forensic science","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.694598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Weapon","weight":0.564734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.46808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.409074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.250571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Omega-3 fatty acid","weight":0.199594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.182924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0988814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Axe","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axe"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Neuroanatomy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroanatomy"},{"name":"Caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliber"},{"name":"Criminal code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_code"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Chop, Ukraine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chop,_Ukraine"}]}
