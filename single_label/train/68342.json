{"id":68342,"title":"Double-J ureteral stent under local anesthesia for women.","abstract":"Ureteral stent placement is a key urologic procedure used to manage ureteral obstructions. It is usually performed under general anesthesia (GA) with its inherent risks. The objective was to evaluate safety, feasibility and tolerance of ureteral stent placement under local anesthesia (LA) in women.From January 2010 to January 2013, we prospectively and consecutively reviewed all female patients who had an urgent retrograde ureteral stent placement under LA. Only primary stent placements were included in the study. Pain was assessed after surgery by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and pain and comfort assessment during stent placement were reported. We compared outcomes and tolerance with patients under general anesthesia (GA) matched by age and operatives indications during the same period.We included 36 patients (18 under LA and 18 under GA) with a mean age of 59.4 +/- 22.4 years. The mean operative time was 24.4 +/- 12.9 min and 18.8 +/- 6.5 min in LA group and GA group (p = 0.110), respectively. One patient needed GA due to a poor tolerance. The mean perioperative VAS scores under LA and GA were 5.89 +/-2.95 and 2.06 +/- 2.67 (p < 0.0001), respectively. There were no intraoperative complications in either group. The procedure was painful for 16 (88.8%) patients from the LA group and 9 (50%) patients would not accept to undergo this intervention under LA again.Ureteral stent placement under LA in women can be performed safely and effectively. However, this procedure is painful and should be proposed only to selected cases.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529012","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.46748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.392857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.353517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.252918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.227918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Ureteric stent","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureteric_stent"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"All-female band","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-female_band"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Analog Science Fiction and Fact","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
