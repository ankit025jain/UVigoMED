{"id":82619,"title":"Caries experience and related factors in 4-6 year-olds attending dental clinics in Kinshasa, DR of Congo.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and severity of caries experience (CE) in 4-6 year-olds attending dental clinics in Kinshasa, DR Congo, and to explore possible associations with reported behavioural and socio-demographic factors.A convenience sample of children attending five dental clinics was recruited. Carers, usually parents, completed a questionnaire consisting of socio-demographic information, oral health and tobacco consumption profile of parents, socio-economic family situation and oral health habits of the child. Children were clinically examined using WHO criteria by trained dentist-examiners. To investigate factors associated with CE, multivariate logistic regression was applied with the significance level set at 0.05.Some 158 children with mean age 5.3 (sd 0.7) years were recruited; 80% presented with clinical signs of CE. Between-meal snacking and drinking was reported by 78% and 65%; 35% had sugar-containing drinks. Most (81%) brushed once a day and 82% brushed in the morning. Prevalence of CE was associated with gender, frequency of meals, consumption of drinks during meals and consumption of sugar-containing drinks; severity with type of infant feeding and sugar-content of the last meal at night.The present study shows that both prevalence and severity of caries experience were associated with reported dietary habits, confirming the importance of preventive interventions dealing with these habits in young children living in a developing country.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Stomatognathic
