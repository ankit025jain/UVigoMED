{"id":89104,"title":"[Minimally invasive percutaneous osteosynthesis with intramedullary nail and close reduction by manipulation for the treatment of femoral shaft fractures].","abstract":"To explore the technique and clinical results of close reduction by manipulation and minimally invasive percutaneous osteosynthesis with intramedullary nail for the treatment of femur shaft fractures. methods: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze 96 patients with the femur shaft fractures who had been treated with close reduction by manipulation and minimally invasive percutaneous osteosynthesis with intramedullary nail. There were 67 males and 29 females. The average age of patients was 39 years old (ranging from 16 to 88). According to AO fracture classification for the femur shaft fractures,there were 29 cases of type A,46 type B,21 type C.All the patients were followed up and the duration ranged from 12 to 24 months (averaged, 15 months). All the fractures showed union. The time required for the bony union ranged from 3 to 10 months (averaged,4 months). The clinical results were evaluated by Thorsen classification system. At the latest follow-up, 87 patients obtained excellent results, 7 good, 2 fair.This treatment method combines advantages of intramedullary nail with close manipulative reduction, so can get satisfactory clinical results for the treatment of femoral shaft fracture with minimal trauma.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754151","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.883669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.15119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Intramedullary rod","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramedullary_rod"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.119397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0663472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Order of Australia","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Axle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"AC power plugs and sockets","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sven-Ole Thorsen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven-Ole_Thorsen"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Linnaean taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaean_taxonomy"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Stellar classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Psychological manipulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation"}]}
