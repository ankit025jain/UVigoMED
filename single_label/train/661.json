{"id":661,"title":"[Epidemiological characteristics of typhoid fever and antibiotic susceptibility testing of Salmonella Typhi isolates in Guangxi, 1994-2013].","abstract":"Through analyzing the typhoid epidemics and to determine and monitor regional resistance characteristics of the shift of drug resistant profile on Salmonella (S.) Typhi, to understand the related epidemiological characteristics of typhoid fever and to provide evidence for the development of strategies, in Guangxi.Data of typhoid fever from surveillance and reporting system between 1994 to 2013 was collected and statistically analyzed epidemiologically. The susceptibility of 475 S. Typhi isolates from patients on ten antibiotics was tested by broth micro-dilution method and minimum inhibition concentration was obtained and interpreted based on the CLSI standard.From 1994 to 2013, a total of 57 928 cases of typhoid fever were reported in Guangxi province with an annual incidence of 6.29/100 000 and mortality as 0.03%. The higher incidence was observed in the population under 20 years of age. There was no significant difference on incidence between male and female, but farmers and students were among the hardest hit groups. More cases were seen from the northern part of the province. Cases appeared all year round with the peak from May to October. A total of 13 major outbreaks during 2001 to 2013 were reported and the main transmission route was water-borne. All the strains were sensitive to third generation cephalosporins cefotaxime and fluoroquinolones norfloxacin. The susceptibility rates to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin was around 98% but relative lower susceptible rate to ciprofloxacin was seen as 89.89% . The lowest susceptibility was found for streptomycin and sulfamethoxazole agents, with the rates as 67.73% and 65.89% , respectively. One strain was found to have been resistant to ciprofloxacin and another 47 isolates with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Twenty eight isolates were found to be resistant to multiple antibiotics and one displayed ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole tetracycline and nalidixic acid (ACSSxT-NAL) resistance profile. This was the first report in China. Multi-drug resistant strains were frequently isolated from small scale outbreaks of typhoid fever.The incidence of typhoid fever in Guangxi was still high and some strains showed multi-drug resistance and reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, indicating that the surveillance and monitor programs on drug resistance of S. Typhi should be strengthened, to prevent large scale outbreaks of typhoid fever in this province.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25376685","annotations":[{"name":"Nalidixic acid","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalidixic_acid"},{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Cefotaxime","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefotaxime"},{"name":"Chloramphenicol","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloramphenicol"},{"name":"Tetracycline","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline"},{"name":"Typhoid fever","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever"},{"name":"Norfloxacin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfloxacin"},{"name":"Ampicillin","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampicillin"},{"name":"Streptomycin","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomycin"},{"name":"Ciprofloxacin","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciprofloxacin"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Cephalosporin","weight":0.827907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.826996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.818916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Salmonella","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella"},{"name":"Sulfamethoxazole","weight":0.802005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfamethoxazole"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Salmonella enterica enterica","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella_enterica_enterica"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.780965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.337099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.281649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.281638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"China","weight":0.280993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Guangxi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxi"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Waterborne diseases","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterborne_diseases"}]}
