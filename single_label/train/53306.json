{"id":53306,"title":"Influence of diabetes and diabetes type on anatomic and visual outcomes following central rein vein occlusion.","abstract":"To determine the influence of diabetes and diabetes type on ocular outcomes following central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).Retrospective chart review of all patients evaluated over a 4-year period in a tertiary diabetes eye care center. Ophthalmic findings were recorded including visual acuity and the presence of retinal neovascularization at presentation, after 3-6 months, and at last follow-up.The records of 19,648 patients (13,571 diabetic; 6077 nondiabetic) were reviewed. The prevalence of CRVO in diabetic patients (N=72) and nondiabetic patients (N=27) were 0.5 and 0.4%, respectively. Disc neovascularization (21.3 vs 0.0%, P=0.05) and panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) (48.7 vs 21.4%, P=0.01) were more common in diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic patients. Compared with type 2 diabetic patients, retinal neovascularization (28.6 vs 3.7%, P=0.004) and subsequent PRP (78.6 vs 41.9%, P=0.01) were more likely in type 1 patients. Optic nerve head collateral vessels (CVs) were observed less than half as often (21.4 vs 56.5%, P=0.04) in patients with type 1 diabetes. Presence of optic nerve head CVs at baseline was associated with less likelihood of PRP (14.3 vs 46.1%, P=0.03).In this cohort, the rates of CRVO in diabetic and nondiabetic patients were similar to previously published population-based studies. Following CRVO, diabetic patients had higher rates of disc neovascularization and were more likely to require subsequent PRP than nondiabetic patients. As compared with CRVO patients with type 2 diabetes, patients with type 1 diabetes and CRVO had worse anatomic outcomes with substantially increased risks of retinal neovascularization and PRP; however, final visual acuity outcomes were similar.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525865","annotations":[{"name":"Optic nerve","weight":0.837399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.703019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.702056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.692984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.675683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Optometry","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometry"},{"name":"Central retinal vein occlusion","weight":0.398948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein_occlusion"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.382766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.369884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Optic disc","weight":0.30341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_disc"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.267606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.21232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"N27 road (Ireland)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N27_road_(Ireland)"},{"name":"N72 road (Ireland)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N72_road_(Ireland)"},{"name":"648","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/648"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Central retinal vein","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Collateral (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)"},{"name":"Rein","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rein"},{"name":"Curriculum vitae","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae"}]}
