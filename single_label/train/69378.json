{"id":69378,"title":"[Deterioration of kidney function as a risk factor for mortality among patients hospitalized for heart failure].","abstract":"Acute deterioration of kidney function among patients admitted to the hospital for cardiac failure is associated with an increased mortality.To investigate the association between deterioration of kidney function and mortality among patients hospitalized for cardiac failure.Patients admitted for decompensated cardiac failure to 14 Chilean hospitals between 2002 and 2009 were incorporated to the study. Clinical and laboratory features were registered. Serum creatinine values on admission and discharge were determined. Hospital and long term mortality was determined requesting death certificates to the National Identification Service at the end of follow up, lasting 635 ± 581 days.One thousand sixty four patients were incorporated and 1100, aged 68 ± 13 years (45% females) had information about renal function. Seventy seven percent were hypertensive and 36% were diabetic. Mean ejection fraction was 41 ± 18% and 34% had an ejection fraction over 50%. Mean admission creatinine was 1.7 ± 1.6 mg/dl and 19% had a creatinine over 2 mg/dl. Serum creatinine increased more than 0.5 mg/dl during hospitalization in 9% of general patients and in 11% of diabetics. The increase in creatinine was associated with a higher risk of hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR) 12.9, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 6.7-27.6) and long term mortality (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6-3).The deterioration of renal function during hospitalization of patients with heart failure is a risk factor for hospital and long term mortality.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448855","annotations":[{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.820264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.80691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.71056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.641958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.515095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.340845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.266348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Serum creatinine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_creatinine"},{"name":"Decompensation","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensation"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Death certificate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_certificate"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
