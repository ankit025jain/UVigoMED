{"id":50706,"title":"Subacute antidiabetic and in vivo antioxidant effects of methanolic extract of Bridelia micrantha (Hochst Baill) leaf on alloxan-induced hyperglycaemic rats.","abstract":"The methanolic leaf extract of Bridelia micrantha was tested for subacute antidiabetic and in vivo antioxidant effects in alloxan-induced hyperglycaemic rats. The subacute treatment of the extract (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg) produced 75, 68 and 63% reduction in fasting blood sugar level respectively, on day 14 of treatment. The extract produced time-dependent effect, but did not show a dose-dependent effect. Its optimum antidiabetic activity was noted at the dose of 125 mg/kg and this was comparable to glibenclamide 2 mg/kg (positive control). The extract (125 mg/kg) showed good oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) effect in both normoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic rats. The OGTT effect of the extract (125 mg/kg) did not differ significantly (p>0.05) from glibenclamide (2 mg/kg). The antioxidant effect of the extract was assayed through the determination of the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and catalase activity. The extract produced a dose-dependent decrease in the serum level of TBARS and gave its optimum catalase activity at the dose of 500 mg/kg. This study suggests that the B. micrantha extract has antihyperglycaemic and antioxidant activities. Therefore, could be a potential source of novel antidiabetic and antioxidant agent for the management of diabetes mellitus.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760763","annotations":[{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.823868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.817496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.761001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.664259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.631923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Glibenclamide","weight":0.596395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibenclamide"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.380612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.201781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.167811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Sugars in wine","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugars_in_wine"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
