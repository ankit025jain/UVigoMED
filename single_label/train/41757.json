{"id":41757,"title":"Serial changes of serum cytokines in Crohn's disease following treatment with adalimumab.","abstract":"We examined serum cytokine levels in Crohn's disease (CD) patients before and after Adalimumab (ADA) treatment.A total of 24 patients with CD were enrolled (4 colonic type, 6 ileal type, 14 ileo-colonic type). Patients were divided into two groups according to disease duration. Patients were given ADA (160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2), followed by maintenance therapy (40 mg every other week). Serum levels of 17 cytokines were simultaneously determined using a Bio-Plex suspension array system before, 4 and 8 weeks after ADA treatment. Serum CRP levels were also measured before, 4 and 8 weeks after treatment.IL-6 and MCP-1 levels were significantly decreased in all CD patients and in the ileo-colonic type 8 weeks after ADA treatment compared to before treatment (P <0.05). MCP-1 levels were significantly decreased 8 weeks after treatment compared to pre-treatment samples if disease onset occurred longer than 8 years. A significant correlation was noted between CRP and IL-6 levels.The reduction of IL-6 and MCP-1 would be an important role for the improvement of inflammation after ADA treatment in CD which might be associated with disease types and disease duration,","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901140","annotations":[{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.916951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.713328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.709619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Adalimumab","weight":0.699175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalimumab"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.637615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.47071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.398421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.241109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"CCL2","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCL2"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"American Diabetes Association","weight":0.0988413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Diabetes_Association"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Array data structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Opioid replacement therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Metacarpophalangeal joint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpophalangeal_joint"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Array system","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_system"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
