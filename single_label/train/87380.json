{"id":87380,"title":"Oral nutritional support in hip fracture patients.","abstract":"Hip fracture care hs changed significantly over the past 7 years, but poor nutritional intake remains in this patient group, both before and after their hospital admission. This article explores the importance of improving nutritional status as part of the multidisciplinary team's efforts to enhance recovery and improve outcomes after surgery, with a specific focus on the role and evidence for using oral nutritional supplements. Strategies to optimise status and dietary intake should start in the preoperative stage and continue post-operatively in the community.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230433","annotations":[{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.296595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Admission note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_note"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"List of Latin digraphs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_digraphs"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"}]}
