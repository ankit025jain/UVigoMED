{"id":91130,"title":"Lysophosphatidic acid and apolipoprotein A1 predict increased risk of developing World Trade Center-lung injury: a nested case-control study.","abstract":"Metabolic syndrome, inflammatory and vascular injury markers measured in serum after World Trade Center (WTC) exposures predict abnormal FEV1. We hypothesized that elevated LPA levels predict FEV??<?LLN.Nested case-control study of WTC-exposed firefighters. Cases had FEV??<?LLN. Controls derived from the baseline cohort. Demographics, pulmonary function, serum lipids, LPA and ApoA1 were measured.LPA and ApoA1 levels were higher in cases than controls and predictive of case status. LPA increased the odds by 13% while ApoA1 increased the odds by 29% of an FEV??<?LLN in a multivariable model.Elevated LPA and ApoA1 are predictive of a significantly increased risk of developing an FEV??<?LLN.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548082","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.674928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.649722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Third World","weight":0.402615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein","weight":0.194419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Lysophosphatidic acid","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysophosphatidic_acid"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein A1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_A1"},{"name":"World Trade Center","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Firefighter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Nested","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
