{"id":25954,"title":"[Basic knowledge on coagulation and fibrinolysis to understand thrombus-formation machinery].","abstract":"Recent advances in genetic engineering and optical instrumentation have largely contributed to a better understanding of nicely organized spatiotemporal regulations of coagulation and fibrinolysis. In-vivo real time imaging analyses revealed how only partially activated platelets interact with vascular endothelial cells under blood flow, and how platelets are differently activated to form stable thrombus having limited size. Interactions between plasma components and vascular endothelial cells(VECs) are also analyzed by real time imaging, and the mechanism to keep high fibrinolytic potential on VECs is well documented. In this article, we review these recent progresses in basic research on coagulation and fibrinolysis, which were mainly achieved by imaging technique.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163308","annotations":[{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.854513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.794864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.478289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.470229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.302615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.270553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.172054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.153446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Spacetime","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Instrumentation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation"},{"name":"Pure research","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_research"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.0222132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"BASIC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC"},{"name":"Stable isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope"},{"name":"Keep","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep"},{"name":"Vocational Education Committee","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_Education_Committee"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Interactions (The Spectacular Spider-Man)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactions_(The_Spectacular_Spider-Man)"}]}
