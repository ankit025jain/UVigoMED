{"id":61858,"title":"[Febrile episodes of unknown origin, elevated level of plasma ferritin and rapidly developed multiorgan dysfunction].","abstract":"A previously healthy 40-year-old man developed febrile episodes of unknown origin, articular symptoms, venous occlusion of the lower limb and transient elevation of hepatic enzymes, and cutaneous symptoms. Computed tomography scanning revealed enlarged lymph nodes, but no sample was collected. In addition to microcytic anemia, a high serum ferritin level and an increased IL-2 receptor value in serum were found. Drug therapy against tuberculosis and borreliosis was started, but febrile episodes continued and in a few days the patient developed multiorgan dysfunction. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis associated with T-cell lymphoma was revealed as the underlying condition.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660387","annotations":[{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.89675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.815977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Lyme disease","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.672482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.530008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.114755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Microcytic anemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcytic_anemia"},{"name":"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemophagocytic_lymphohistiocytosis"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0242565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"}]}
