{"id":30599,"title":"[Occasional smoking in Norway].","abstract":"In recent decades, daily smoking has become less common, while occasional smoking has stayed at the same level. The purpose of the study is to describe occasional smokers on the basis of their smoking behaviour and socio-demographic characteristics.Data from Statistics Norway's quarterly surveys of tobacco use in 2010 and 2011 were used. Information on smoking habits, smoking-related behaviour and the respondents' attitudes to their own smoking was collected in telephone interviews.Of the 8,700 men and women aged 16-74 (response rate 57%) who were included, altogether 1,583 were daily smokers and 907 occasional smokers. The occasional smokers were younger, more frequently lived in large cities and had a higher level of education and income than the daily smokers. Twenty-nine of 174 (17%) occasional smokers used snus on a daily basis, compared to 10 of 394 (3%) of the daily smokers. The occasional smokers had great confidence in their ability to quit: 95% responded that they would be smoke-free in five years, compared to 55% of the daily smokers (n = 2,158). Fifty-five (35%) of the occasional smokers lit up several times weekly (16 cigarettes per week on average), while the remaining (65%) smoked only once per week as a maximum (five cigarettes per week on average). Those who smoked several times each week had attitudes to their own smoking and usage pattern for tobacco that were similar to those of the daily smokers. Nearly half of the occasional smokers defined themselves as non-smokers.Norwegian occasional smokers are a heterogeneous group in terms of their smoking pattern and frequency, and many define themselves as non-smokers.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477149","annotations":[{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.597515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Norway","weight":0.580555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.38828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.32253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.314447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.129985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Smoking (cooking)","weight":0.124493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Magazine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine"},{"name":"Snus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"394","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/394"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"1674","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1674"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"907","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/907"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Habituation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habituation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
