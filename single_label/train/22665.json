{"id":22665,"title":"Adjunctive management of central line-associated bloodstream infections with 70% ethanol-lock therapy.","abstract":"Ethanol is bactericidal against most pathogens implicated in central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and biofilms. Current Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines cite insufficient evidence to support adjunctive ethanol-lock therapy (ELT) for central venous catheter (CVC) salvage in patients with CLABSI in combination with systemic antimicrobial treatment. We evaluated the safety and potential efficacy of 70% ELT for CLABSI at our institution after implementation of a hospital ELT protocol.We collected data on all patients treated with adjunctive 70% ELT for catheter salvage from September 2009 to September 2011 and assessed clinical outcomes and adverse events associated with ELT.Sixty-eight hospitalized patients received 70% ELT for CVC salvage: 45 (66%) met the criteria for CLABSI. Five (11%) had persistent or recurrent bacteraemia triggering CVC removal; 28 (62%) preserved their CVC long term. There were no documented adverse events associated with ELT.Adjunctive 70% ELT is an inexpensive, well-tolerated option for CVC salvage in patients with CLABSI and warrants further investigation.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526514","annotations":[{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Central venous catheter","weight":0.798218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.793125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Bactericide","weight":0.661495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactericide"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.632206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.625339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.624106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.60524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.603602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.584469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.510535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.459516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.328977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.274684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases Society of America","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_Diseases_Society_of_America"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Peripheral venous catheter","weight":0.095195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_venous_catheter"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Legal burden of proof","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"}]}
