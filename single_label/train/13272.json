{"id":13272,"title":"Trichostatin A increases the levels of plasma gelsolin and amyloid beta-protein in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","abstract":"Gelsolin (GSN), a multifunctional protein, binds to amyloid beta-protein (A?), inhibits its fibrillization, solubilizes preformed A? fibrils, and helps in its clearance from the brain. Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, induces the protein expression of gelsolin. In the present study, we investigated how TSA-treatment of APPswe/PS1?E9 transgenic (Tg) mice of Alzheimer's disease (AD) will affect the plasma levels of gelsolin and A?.TSA (5mg/kg body weight on alternate days for two months) was intraperitoneally injected to AD Tg mice. Gelsolin was measured by Western blotting and A? was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.TSA-treatment significantly increased the levels of plasma gelsolin by 1.79-fold as compared with vehicle-treated control mice (p<0.01). The levels of A? 1-40 and A? 1-42 in the plasma were also higher in TSA-treated mice in comparison with vehicle-treated mice. The treatment of transgenic AD mice with TSA did not affect the body weight in both male and female groups as compared to vehicle-treated animals. A positive correlation was observed between the plasma levels of gelsolin and A? 1-40 (r=0.594, p=0.042) or A? 1-42 (r=0.616, p=0.033) in AD Tg mice.These results suggest that TSA increases the levels of plasma gelsolin and A? in AD Tg mice, which may have implications in gelsolin-mediated clearance of A?.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Animal
