{"id":54907,"title":"Effect of yellow-tinted intraocular lens on standard automated perimetry and short wavelength automated perimetry in patients with glaucoma.","abstract":"To investigate the effect of cataract surgery and yellow-tinted intraocular lens (IOLs) implantation on perimetry indices of short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) and standard automated perimetry (SAP) testing in patients with coexisting cataract and glaucoma.In this prospective comparative case series, phacoemulsification with implantation of yellow-tinted Acrysof Natural IOL was performed in 16 eyes of 16 patients with visually significant cataract (best-corrected visual acuity (VA) better than 20/120) and mild to moderate glaucoma. Pre- and postoperative values for VA and for perimetry indices including mean deviation (MD), pattern standard deviation (PSD), and foveal threshold (FT) from both SAP and SWAP testing were compared.Postoperative VA improved significantly after cataract surgery and yellow-tinted IOL implantation (P < 0.001). After cataract extraction and IOL implantation, MD and FT on SWAP testing improved significantly (P = 0.001); however, there was no statistically significant change with SAP testing between the pre- and postoperative perimetry indices. There was no statistically significant change in PSD with either SAP or SWAP testing postoperatively. The differences between pre- and postoperative values for all perimetry indices under study were not significant when comparing SAP with SWAP tests, except for MD which had improved statistically significantly in SWAP testing (P = 0.03).In mild to moderate glaucoma patients with cataracts, the perimetry indices of SWAP testing improved after phacoemulsification and yellow-tinted IOL implantation. This suggests that the yellow-tinted IOLs have less effect on SWAP testing than visually significant cataracts.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25100904","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.760143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Wavelength","weight":0.756096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.752243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.621261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.279079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Perimetry","weight":0.278627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimetry"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.274725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.208754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.170942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"SAP AG","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_AG"},{"name":"Absolute deviation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_deviation"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Foveal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveal"},{"name":"SWAP","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAP"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Social Democratic Party (Portugal)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_(Portugal)"},{"name":"Fourier transform","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
