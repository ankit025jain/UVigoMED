{"id":56051,"title":"Primary posterior laser-assisted capsulotomy.","abstract":"To describe new techniques for performing primary posterior laser-assisted capsulotomy (PLC) to prevent posterior capsule opacification after cataract surgery.After lens and cortex removal, three different techniques were used to cut the posterior capsule with an image-guided (optical coherence tomography [OCT]) femtosecond laser. Technique 1: Prior to intra-ocular lens (IOL) implantation, the posterior capsule was carefully opened and elevated with ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) whereas the anterior hyaloid surface remains intact. After sterile re-docking, the posterior capsule was cut and removed and followed by IOL implantation. Techniques 2 and 3: After IOL implantation, a thin layer of OVD was injected between the IOL optic and the posterior capsule. After sterile re-docking, Berger's space and the posterior capsule were identified using OCT and the capsule was cut by the laser. The posterior capsule is located close to the anterior hyaloid membrane in Technique 2 and the posterior capsule is located between the posterior optic surface of the IOL and the anterior hyaloid in Technique 3.Technique 1 was performed in 50 PLC cases. All capsulotomies were easy to remove and no complications were observed. Techniques 2 and 3 were performed in 53 of 55 PLC cases. In 45 of these cases (82%), the posterior capsule was localized with open space between the IOL and Berger's space. In all treated PLC cases, a 360Â° cut was successfully accomplished.The described techniques for PLC have the potential to prevent and solve posterior capsule opacification in routine cases.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763479","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.902927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.816171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.777621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.515055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.50751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.475603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Sterilization (microbiology)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Vitreous membrane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_membrane"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Technique (album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technique_(album)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hyaline","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaline"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
