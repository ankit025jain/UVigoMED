It was found that long-term feeding a high-calorie diet increased blood concentration of glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and insulin and reduced the rate of glucose uptake in comparison with rats receiving standard ration.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770747","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.790266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.378737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.23704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.102124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.0546142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Prediabetes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Rationing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Glucose uptake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_uptake"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
