{"id":91209,"title":"Neuropsychiatry of persistent symptoms after concussion.","abstract":"A minority of individuals will continue to experience debilitating symptoms for more than several months after sustaining a concussion. These problems may have multiple causes, including persistence of the original concussion symptoms, but they also may be due to factors such as depression and anxiety, physical problems, and psychological issues (including coping with an adverse insurance and legal system). This article reviews the differential diagnosis and treatment strategies for patients with chronic symptoms that persist after a concussion.
