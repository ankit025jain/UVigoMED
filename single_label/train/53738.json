{"id":53738,"title":"Fluorescence-guided surgery with a fluorophore-conjugated antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), that highlights the tumor, improves surgical resection and increases survival in orthotopic mouse models of human pancreatic cancer.","abstract":"We have developed a method of distinguishing normal tissue from pancreatic cancer in vivo using fluorophore-conjugated antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The objective of this study was to evaluate whether fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) with a fluorophore-conjugated antibody to CEA, to highlight the tumor, can improve surgical resection and increase disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in orthotopic mouse models of human pancreatic cancer.We established nude-mouse models of human pancreatic cancer with surgical orthotopic implantation of the human BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer. Orthotopic tumors were allowed to develop for 2 weeks. Mice then underwent bright-light surgery (BLS) or FGS 24 h after intravenous injection of anti-CEA-Alexa Fluor 488. Completeness of resection was assessed from postoperative imaging. Mice were followed postoperatively until premorbid to determine DFS and OS.Complete resection was achieved in 92 % of mice in the FGS group compared to 45.5 % in the BLS group (p = 0.001). FGS resulted in a smaller postoperative tumor burden (p = 0.01). Cure rates with FGS compared to BLS improved from 4.5 to 40 %, respectively (p = 0.01), and 1-year postoperative survival rates increased from 0 % with BLS to 28 % with FGS (p = 0.01). Median DFS increased from 5 weeks with BLS to 11 weeks with FGS (p = 0.0003). Median OS increased from 13.5 weeks with BLS to 22 weeks with FGS (p = 0.001).FGS resulted in greater cure rates and longer DFS and OS using a fluorophore-conjugated anti-CEA antibody. FGS has potential to improve the surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499827","annotations":[{"name":"Carcinoembryonic antigen","weight":0.89825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoembryonic_antigen"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.819078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.700903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.647214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.627487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.567905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.536003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.449231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.245833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Geological Society of London","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_Society_of_London"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Completeness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Basic life support","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_life_support"},{"name":"Fluorophore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorophore"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
