{"id":69808,"title":"[Preparation and characterization of cucurbitacin B sodium deoxycholate/phospholipid-mixed oral fast dissolving film and antitumor activity study].","abstract":"A novel drug delivery system combining oral fast dissolving film with sodium deoxycholate/phospholipid mixed micelles was prepared to increase the absorption of cucurbitacin B that is a poor aqueous solubility substance. Encapsulation efficiency, particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity coefficient, investigated the morphology, disintegration time of oral fast dissolving film and the pharmacodynamic properties of cucurbitacin B sodium deoxycholate/phospholipid-mixed micelles before and after solidified in mice were evaluated and compared. The oral fast dissolving film prepared in this study showed a homogeneous pale yellow and could completely disintegrated in the 30 s. It could meet the requirements of rapidly disintegrating fully. The encapsulation efficiency, particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity coefficient of cucurbitacin B sodium deoxycholate/phospholipid-mixed micelles loaded in oral fast dissolving film were (43.36 +/- 2.12)%, (108.82 +/- 5.2) nm, (-34.18 +/- 1.07) mV, 0.088 +/- 0.012, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency, particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity coefficient of cucurbitacin B sodium deoxycholate/phospholipid-mixed micelles in solution were (41.26 +/- 2.22)%, (181.82 +/- 4.48) nm, (-30.67 +/- 0.81) mV, 0.092 +/- 0.012, respectively. The difference of pharmacodynamics among film of cucurbitacin B-loaded micelles, cucurbitacin B-loaded micelles and free cucurbitacin B in vivo was compared. Solubility of cucurbitacin B loaded in sodium deoxycholate/phospholipid-mixed micelles has also been greatly improved. The tumor inhibition rate of cucurbitacin B loaded in sodium deoxycholate/phospholipid-mixed micelles was significantly improved and did not change significantly before and after solidified. These showed that the sodium deoxycholate/phospholipid-mixed micelles could enhance the antitumor activities of cucurbitacin B and the stability of cucurbitacin B sodium deoxycholate/phospholipid-mixed micelles was improved significantly after solidified by oral fast dissolving film technology without pharmacodynamic properties changed significantly.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282885","annotations":[{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.753561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"In
