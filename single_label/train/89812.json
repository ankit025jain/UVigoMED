{"id":89812,"title":"Posterior sternoclavicular joint injuries in skeletally immature patients.","abstract":"The management of sternoclavicular injuries in skeletally immature patients has not been well described. The purpose of this study was to describe the authors' experience treating this rare and potentially life-threatening injury. All skeletally immature patients who underwent treatment for a medial clavicular physeal fracture or sternoclavicular dislocation between 2003 and 2011 were identified using ICD-9 diagnostic codes. Sternoclavicular injuries with posterior displacement were isolated from this cohort for a thorough chart review. Patients were contacted to complete brief phone surveys and shoulder-specific outcome instruments. A total of 12 boys (mean age, 14.8Â±2.74 years), followed for an average of 10.3 months (range, 0-54 months), were identified. The incidence of significant associated symptoms was 8.3% (1 of 12). Eight patients were initially treated with closed reduction, 2 (25%) successfully and 6 (75%) requiring subsequent open reduction. Four of the 12 patients underwent an immediate open reduction. Braided composite sutures were used to treat all injuries that underwent open reduction (10 of 12). Complete data were obtained from 6 patients, all of whose injuries had been treated with open reduction. All 6 had returned to their full activity level, and all self-reported perfect Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) and Simple Shoulder Test scores (0 and 12, respectively). Among skeletally immature patients, medial clavicular physeal fractures and sternoclavicular dislocations can be effectively managed with closed or open reduction. When closed reduction is unsuccessful or is contraindicated, open reduction with braided composite sutures is associated with excellent results.
