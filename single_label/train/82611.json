{"id":82611,"title":"[Serum, oral and gingival fluid levels of heat shock protein-70, cytokines and their autoantibodies by periodontal disease].","abstract":"The study of 25 patients with periodontitis showed that the level of heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) and IL-1?, IL-8 was increased in serum, buccal and gingival fluids as compared with healthy individuals, as well as the serum level of IgG autoantibodies both to HSP70 and to cytokines. In oral and gingival fluids sIgA autoantibodies to the same antigens were found. It was suggested that these autoantibodies can eliminate HSP-70 pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus regulating their levels in the inflammation area.
