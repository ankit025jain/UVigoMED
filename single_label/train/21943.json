{"id":21943,"title":"Antiurease activity of plants growing in the Czech Republic.","abstract":"The antiurease activity of the aqueous extracts of 42 plants growing in the Czech Republic was investigated. A phenol-hypochlorite reaction was used for the determination of ammonia produced by urease. The inhibitory activity of the extracts at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL varied from 17.8% to 80.0%. Extracts from six Potentilla species expressed inhibitory activity against jack bean urease. They were further investigated for their phenolic constituents and the major compounds were subjected to molecular docking. The results revealed that both jack bean urease and Helicobacter pylori urease were inhibited by quercetin-3-O-?-D-galactopyranoside-6?-gallate (1), myricetin-3-O-?-D-glucuronide (2), tiliroside (3) and B-type procyanidin (4). The antiurease activity of the investigated Potentilla species is probably due to the presence of complex phenolic constituents such as flavonoid glycosides and catechin dimers.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579848","annotations":[{"name":"Quercetin","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin"},{"name":"Ammonia","weight":0.922164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.92209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Catechin","weight":0.723269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechin"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Myricetin","weight":0.637597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myricetin"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.540438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.485991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.430486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Glycoside","weight":0.392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside"},{"name":"Urease","weight":0.382443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urease"},{"name":"Bean","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean"},{"name":"Proanthocyanidin","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proanthocyanidin"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.28188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Gallic acid","weight":0.261224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_acid"},{"name":"Phenols","weight":0.208152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenols"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Docking (molecular)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)"},{"name":"Potentilla","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentilla"},{"name":"Czech Republic","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Protein dimer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_dimer"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"}]}
