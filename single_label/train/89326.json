{"id":89326,"title":"Life-space mobility declines associated with incident falls and fractures.","abstract":"To determine the effect of falls and fractures on life-space mobility in a cohort of community-dwelling older adults.Prospective, observational study with a baseline in-home assessment and 6-month telephone follow-up interviews over 4 years.Central Alabama.Community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older recruited from a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries stratified according to sex, race, and urban versus rural residence (N = 970).Sociodemographic factors, medical history, depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale), cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination), mobility-related symptoms, transportation difficulty, and healthcare use were assessed during a baseline in-home interview of participants. Life-space mobility and falls or injuries (including fractures) were assessed at the baseline interview and at 6-month intervals in follow-up telephone calls.Four hundred fifty-four (47%) participants reported at least one fall during the 4-year follow-up. The life-space score fell 3.2 points from the beginning to the end of the 6-month interval during which a fall occurred, adjusting for other known predictors of decline in life-space mobility. The decrease in interval life-space score was progressively greater for a fall and an injury (-4.7 points), a fall and a fracture (-14.2 points), and a fall and a hip fracture (-23.6 points).Falls, whether associated with an injury or not, were independently associated with a decrease in life-space mobility in the ensuing 6 months. Further studies are needed to determine reasons for life-space mobility decline in community-dwelling older adults with incident falls without any injuries.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731095","annotations":[{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.812462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Medicare (United States)","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.439691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.38828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Central Alabama","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Alabama"},{"name":"Geriatric Depression Scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatric_Depression_Scale"},{"name":"Alabama","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"970","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/970"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Scale model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Staatsexamen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staatsexamen"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Random sample","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social mobility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Beneficiary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneficiary"}]}
