{"id":51640,"title":"Determination of antioxidant capacity, ?-amylase and lipase inhibitory activity of Crotalaria juncea Linn in vitro inhibitory activity of Crotalaria Juncea Linn.","abstract":"The present study involves the determination of antioxidant capacity and in vitro ?-amylase and lipase inhibitory activity of the Crotalaria juncea Linn extract. The content of polyphenols, flavonoids, and tannins in the extracts was estimated by spectrophotometry. Antioxidant activity on goat liver lipid peroxidation and linoleic acid emulsion were determined and ?-amylase and lipase inhibitory activity was also evaluated. All the extracts had shown antioxidant property, ?-amylase, and lipase inhibitory properties. Aqueous extract was found to show maximum antioxidant activity on goat liver. Antilipid peroxidation and antioxidant activity were determined to be 66.94 ± 0.616 (p < .01) and 59.54 ± 0.2 (p < .01), respectively. Maximum ?-amylase and lipase inhibitory activities of 71.42 ± 1.37 (p < .01) and 57.14 ± 2.74% (p < .01), respectively, were exhibited by macerated methanol extract. The results had shown that all the extracts exhibited low inhibition and antioxidant activity as compared to standard.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670121","annotations":[{"name":"Methanol","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.82955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Spectrophotometry","weight":0.778916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.76088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Linoleic acid","weight":0.723194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid"},{"name":"Amylase","weight":0.714271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.695251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tannin","weight":0.669644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Lipase","weight":0.650072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipase"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.591391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.566416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Oxygen radical absorbance capacity","weight":0.375534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_radical_absorbance_capacity"},{"name":"Emulsion","weight":0.233333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion"},{"name":"Goat","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Phenolic compounds in wine","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenolic_compounds_in_wine"}]}
