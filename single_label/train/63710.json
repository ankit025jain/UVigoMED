{"id":63710,"title":"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia due to heparin lock in a hemodialysis patient: a case report.","abstract":"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a potentially fatal clinical condition which can develop after exposure to unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparins. Even small doses of heparin such as heparin flushes in hemodialysis catheter can induce the development of HIT. However, the true incidence of heparin lock-related HIT is unknown. We report a 58-year-old woman with acute kidney injury because of obstructive uropathy who developed HIT after heparin-free hemodialysis. She was found to have severe thrombocytopenia with deep vein thrombosis of left lower limb and arterial thrombosis of the right anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The heparin-platelet factor 4 antibody was positive and she was put on plasmapharesis. However, her condition further deteriorated and succumbed shortly. Heparin lock solution in the hemodialysis catheter was believed to be the cause of HIT in our patient.
