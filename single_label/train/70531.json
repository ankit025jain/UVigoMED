{"id":70531,"title":"Synthesis of immunotargeted magneto-plasmonic nanoclusters.","abstract":"Magnetic and plasmonic properties combined in a single nanoparticle provide a synergy that is advantageous in a number of biomedical applications including contrast enhancement in novel magnetomotive imaging modalities, simultaneous capture and detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and multimodal molecular imaging combined with photothermal therapy of cancer cells. These applications have stimulated significant interest in development of protocols for synthesis of magneto-plasmonic nanoparticles with optical absorbance in the near-infrared (NIR) region and a strong magnetic moment. Here, we present a novel protocol for synthesis of such hybrid nanoparticles that is based on an oil-in-water microemulsion method. The unique feature of the protocol described herein is synthesis of magneto-plasmonic nanoparticles of various sizes from primary blocks which also have magneto-plasmonic characteristics. This approach yields nanoparticles with a high density of magnetic and plasmonic functionalities which are uniformly distributed throughout the nanoparticle volume. The hybrid nanoparticles can be easily functionalized by attaching antibodies through the Fc moiety leaving the Fab portion that is responsible for antigen binding available for targeting.","date":"2014-09-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177973","annotations":[{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.752284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.728081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Magnetic moment","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.619871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.485982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.466724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.384619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Absorbance","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance"},{"name":"Molecular imaging","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_imaging"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.167108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Plasmon","weight":0.154971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmon"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Fragment crystallizable region","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_crystallizable_region"},{"name":"Microemulsion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microemulsion"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Semiconductor device fabrication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"MRI contrast agent","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI_contrast_agent"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
