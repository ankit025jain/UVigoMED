{"id":50704,"title":"Level of circulating endothelial cells and expression of nuclear factor kappa beta of human's peripheral blood mononuclear cells in subjects with certain conditions.","abstract":"to detect the levels of CEC and expression of NF?B in the three groups of subjects with certain conditions.this study is an exploratory study using human peripheral blood samples. The study subjects comprised three groups, the group of 23 healthy people, a group of 35 people that has one or more risk factors for vascular disease and a group of 15 vascular disease patients (coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke). CEC were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). CEC level is identified through the measurement of CD45 and CD146 by flowcytometry method. NF?B expression is recognized by ELISA method (imgenex, USA).the highest average levels of CEC were found in the sick group (28.6%). The highest average expression of NF?B (924.9495) is found in the group with risk factors. The lowest average expression of NF?B and CEC is found in the healthy group. Statistical analysis of ANOVA at the interval confidence of 95% shows a significant difference (p=0.00) levels of CEC and NF?B expression between the healthy group with the group with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and patients with known CVD.increase of level CEC and NF?B expression has a strong relationship with vascular disease and its risk factors.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760806","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.877613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.797493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.724534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.688546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Vascular disease","weight":0.514089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_disease"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.392779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.316423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.297819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0842264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0450952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"PTPRC","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPRC"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
