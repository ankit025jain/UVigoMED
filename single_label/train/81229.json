{"id":81229,"title":"[MRI of the temporomandibular joint--the gold standard].","abstract":"MRI has been established as the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD), as it allows for a noninvasive detailed evaluation of the joint that is not otherwise available. During the last decade, the introduction of dynamic (cine-mode) MR imaging has made functional evaluation feasible in addition to the morphologic study of the joint. The major advantage of MRI is its ability to study the articular disc and its congruity as well as its location relative to the condyle in both closed- and open-mouth positions. Due to its high contrast resolution, MRI is unique in demonstrating joint effusion, bone edema and sclerosis, rupture of the retrodiscal layers and impairment of the lateral pterigoid muscle. In Mor-Mar Imaging Center we performed during the last two years MRI studies of the TMJ in 234 subjects, 172 (74%) female and 62 (26%) male patients. The average age of the patients was 29 years. In this article we present our experience in the evaluation of TMD and review the main indications and findings. In addition, our experience in optimizing the MRI sequence protocols in both static and dynamic modes are discussed. MRI examinations provide the clinician with anatomic and physiologic information that can guide treatment decisions. It has a special role in monitoring and evaluating treatment results, both conservative and surgical.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Stomatognathic
