{"id":87232,"title":"[Treatment of atlanto-axial vertebral instability fractures with cervical posterior pedicle screw internal fixation and interbody fusion].","abstract":"To explore the clinical effects of cervical posterior pedicle screw internal fixation and interbody fusion for the treatment of atlanto-axial vertebral instability fractures.From July 2008 to July 2013, 21 patients with atlanto-axial vertebral instability fractures were treated with vertebral pedicle screw internal fixation and interbody fusion through posterior approach. There were 14 males and 7 females, aged from 20 to 55 years old with an average of 32 years. Lifted and guided the atlanto-axial vertebral pedicle screw to reduce atlanto-axial vertebral displacement.All patients were followed up from 6 to 24 months with an average of 12.5 months. Wounds got healed without complication of infection. Clinical symptoms were relieved at 6 months after operation. According to ASIA score standard to assess at 6 months after operation, the items of motion, light touch and needle score had obviously improved, and respectively were 99.45 ±0.27, 111.09 ± 0.47,111.11 ± 0.58. VAS and NDI scores also had obviously improved, and respectively were 1.04 ± 0.38 and 12.56 ± 2.24. Imaging examinations showed internal fixation locations were good, without atlanto-axial joint instability.Cervical posterior pedicle screw internal fixation and interbody fusion can effectively restore the stability of atlanto-axial joint, reduce complication and obtain satisfactory effects.","date":"2015-01-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25571660","annotations":[{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.86392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.722654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.518116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.39772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.167861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Atlanto-axial joint","weight":0.122673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanto-axial_joint"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Pedicle of vertebral arch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicle_of_vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"2008 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Joint stability","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_stability"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"}]}
