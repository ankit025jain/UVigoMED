{"id":55454,"title":"A longitudinal comparison of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence in geographic atrophy.","abstract":"To identify reliable criteria based on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) to monitor disease progression in geographic atrophy attributable to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) compared with lesion size determination based on fundus autofluorescence (FAF).Prospective longitudinal observational study.setting: Institutional. study population: A total of 48 eyes in 24 patients with geographic atrophy. observation procedures: Eyes with geographic atrophy were included and examined at baseline and at months 3, 6, 9, and 12. At each study visit best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), FAF, and SD OCT imaging were performed. FAF images were analyzed using the region overlay device. Planimetric measurements in SD OCT, including alterations or loss of outer retinal layers and the RPE, as well as choroidal signal enhancement, were performed with the OCT Toolkit. main outcome measures: Areas of interest in patients with geographic atrophy measured from baseline to month 12 by SD OCT compared with the area of atrophy measured by FAF.Geographic atrophy lesion size increased from 8.88 mm² to 11.22 mm² based on quantitative FAF evaluation. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that results similar to FAF planimetry for determining lesion progression can be obtained by measuring the areas of outer plexiform layer thinning (adjusted R(2) = 0.93), external limiting membrane loss (adjusted R(2) = 0.89), or choroidal signal enhancement (R(2) = 0.93) by SD OCT.SD OCT allows morphologic markers of disease progression to be identified in geographic atrophy and may improve understanding of the pathophysiology of atrophic AMD.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Eye
