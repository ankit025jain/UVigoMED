{"id":68893,"title":"Pediatric robotic pyeloplasty in patients weighing less than 10 kg initial experience.","abstract":"To report the feasibility and safety of a robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty (RALP) in patients weighing <10 kg.Three patients weighing between 5 and 8 kg who were affected by severe congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction, including a child with solitary kidney, were subjected to RALP. Three trocars were placed; sutures and pyeloplasty remodeling were performed with interrupted stitches. A double J stent was inserted through a 2-mm transparietal angiocatheter to protect the pyelic suture.The procedures were all completed within 90 minutes, the \"docking\" time requiring 20 minutes. The patients were discharged on postoperative day 2, without any complications.Comprehensive assessment of pyelic suture in a very narrow field with 2 operative instruments is feasible and safe. Robotic pyeloplasty provides all the advantages of mini-invasive surgery with the added advantage of higher magnification and excellent surgical navigation in very small spaces and on fragile infant tissues.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487172","annotations":[{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.769534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.717789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.621221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.619937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.594927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.389893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.257566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Magnification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification"},{"name":"Renovation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation"},{"name":"Docking (animal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(animal)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Computer-assisted surgery","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_surgery"},{"name":"Pyeloplasty","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyeloplasty"}]}
