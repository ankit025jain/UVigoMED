{"id":42708,"title":"RAC1b overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in KRAS/BRAF WT metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with first-line FOLFOX/XELOX chemotherapy.","abstract":"Chemotherapy is the principal treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. RAC1b, a RAC1 spliced variant, is over-expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), and impairs apoptosis by activation of nuclear-factor-KB. Since RAC1b has been associated with the BRAF(V600E) mutation, associated with poor prognosis in CRC, we evaluated the role of RAC1b expression as a predictor of chemotherapy efficacy in mCRC.We analysed KRAS and BRAF mutation, microsatellite instability and RAC1b expression in 157 mCRC patients treated with FOLFOX/XELOX in first-line therapy.KRAS mutations were detected in 46 patients (34%), 10 patients were BRAF mutant (7%) and 79 were WT for both, KRAS and BRAF (59%). RAC1b overexpression was found in 30 patients (19%). In the multivariate analysis, BRAF mutational status was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival (OS); hazard ratio (HR), 2.78 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.35-5.72; p=0.0057). RAC1b overexpression was a poor survival factor for OS (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.2-4.59; p=0.01) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.78; p=0.01) in KRAS/BRAF WT mCRC patients.RAC1b overexpression constitutes a marker of poor prognosis in KRAS/BRAF WT mCRC patients treated with first-line FOLFOX/XELOX therapy.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24833563","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Microsatellite (genetics)","weight":0.850585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.849348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.773497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Microsatellite instability","weight":0.71905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_instability"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.674451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.654754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.604701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"KRAS","weight":0.594437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"RAC1","weight":0.202462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAC1"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.177919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"BRAF (gene)","weight":0.169585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAF_(gene)"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.128571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Cyclic redundancy check","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check"},{"name":"355","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/355"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"}]}
