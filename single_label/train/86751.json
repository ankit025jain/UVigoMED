{"id":86751,"title":"Protein kinase inhibitors to treat non-small-cell lung cancer.","abstract":"Activating mutations of the EGFR and rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) best illustrate the therapeutic relevance of molecular characterization in NSCLC patients.For this review article, all published data on the most relevant Phase III trials with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of NSCLC were collected and analyzed.Eight Phase III trials clearly established EGFR TKIs as the best therapeutic option for front-line therapy in EGFR-mutated patients. In pretreated NSCLC, EGFR TKIs are considered more effective than standard monotherapy with cytotoxics in presence of classical EGFR mutations, whereas in the EGFR wild-type population, a similar efficacy to docetaxel or pemetrexed in term of survival has been demonstrated. In ALK-translocated NSCLC, a Phase III trial demonstrated the superiority of a multi-target TKI, including ALK, in terms of progression-free survival, response rate and toxicity profile when compared to standard second-line chemotherapy. New agents targeting EGFR or ALK are under evaluation particularly in individuals with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs or crizotinib.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745764","annotations":[{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.858625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Pemetrexed","weight":0.818574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemetrexed"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.751623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Anaplasia","weight":0.697067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplasia"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.671019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.522641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.337159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.250421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.191855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.149486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase","weight":0.13919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplastic_lymphoma_kinase"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"}]}
