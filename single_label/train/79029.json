{"id":79029,"title":"Benefits of the use of ICT in school activities by students with motor, speech, visual, and hearing impairment: a literature review.","abstract":"Information and communication technology (ICT) has the potential to enhance participation in educational activities for students with physical disabilities. Even though incorporating ICTs into teaching and learning in education has become an important issue, it is unclear what evidence research has provided. The aim of this study was to investigate types of ICT items and how ICT is being used by students with physical disabilities, and describe the benefits of ICT use in school activities.A systematic literature search, covering the period 2000-May 2012, was performed in the databases AMED, CINAHL, Eric, OTseeker, Psych Info, PubMed, and Scopus. Data analysis entailed extracting, editing, grouping, and abstracting findings.A total of 32 articles were included, 16 of which were intervention studies. More than half of the studies concerned students with motor impairments. Type of ICT used differed among impairment groups, and ICT seemed to be especially beneficial for writing, spelling, and communication.Even though the review found heterogeneity across the studies students seemed to benefit from ICT use regardless of the type. For future research it is important to highlight intervention studies, especially for students with visual, hearing, and communication impairments.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506197","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.771015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Information and communications technology","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology"},{"name":"Writing","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing"},{"name":"School","weight":0.670684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.630919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.615995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.54584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.540631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.49216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.332034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.219121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.209495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.127283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.107807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Spelling","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Editing","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Scopus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Data mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining"},{"name":"Entailment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entailment"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Electric motor","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"}]}
