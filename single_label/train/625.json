{"id":625,"title":"Lyme disease with effusion either in hip or knee in children from Podlaskie region treated in clinic in 2004-2010.","abstract":"Lyme disease (LB) relatively commonly causes arthritis among patients, especially in LB endemic area. The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence of LB in children with hip and knee effusion in the North Eastern region of Poland. Conclusions from our study should justify the need of taking into account LB in the diagnosis of hip or knee effusion in children.The medical records of 321 children, aged 2-18 years, with synovitis of the hip or knee were reviewed.In 273 cases with hip effusion: 32 (11.72%) patients were diagnosed with LB, 233 (85.74%) with transient arthritis, 6 (2.19%) with purulent arthritis, and 2 (0.73%) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. In 48 cases with knee effusion: 12 (25%) patients were diagnosed with Lyme arthritis, 24 (50%) with transient arthritis, 5 (10.42%) with reactive arthritis, 4 (8.33%) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and 3 (6.25%) with purulent arthritis.The high prevalence of LB in children with hip or knee effusion in endemic areas suggests the need of diagnostics also for LB in all patients presenting with acute monoarticular arthritis. Antibiotic treatment results in complete recovery.","date":"2014-11-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25394303","annotations":[{"name":"Lyme disease","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.72001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis","weight":0.62634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_idiopathic_arthritis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Reactive arthritis","weight":0.553049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_arthritis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.296238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.212873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Synovitis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovitis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Linebacker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Eastern Region (Ghana)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Region_(Ghana)"},{"name":"233 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/233_(number)"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Podlaskie Voivodeship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podlaskie_Voivodeship"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"}]}
