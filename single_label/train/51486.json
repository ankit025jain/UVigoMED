{"id":51486,"title":"GSTM1-null and GSTT1-null genotypes are associated with essential arterial hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"To evaluate whether the genetic polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferases M1 (GSTM1) and T1 (GSTT1), Ile105Val of the GSTP1 (rs947894), and the Val16Ala polymorphism of the MnSOD (rs4880) are associated with essential arterial hypertension (EAH) in Caucasians with type 2 diabetes.1015 Slovenian subjects (Caucasians) with type 2 diabetes with/without EAH were enrolled in the cross-sectional study. Genotypes were determined by multiplex PCR amplification and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.In the cross-sectional study, GSTM1-null genotype and GSTT1-null genotype were associated with EAH in subjects with type 2 diabetes (59.0% vs. 50.3%, p=0.007; 28.5% vs. 20.7%, p=0.008; consequently).After adjustment for age, body mass index, and hsCRP level, GSTM1-null and GSTT1-null genotypes were found to be independent risk factors for the development of EAH in Slovenian patients with type 2 diabetes.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685594","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.912986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.774944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.381821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"GSTP1","weight":0.376702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSTP1"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.356056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Isoleucine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoleucine"},{"name":"Multiplex polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_S-transferase_Mu_1"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Valine","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valine"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Slovenia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia"},{"name":"1015","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1015"},{"name":"Null hypothesis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis"},{"name":"SOD2","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOD2"},{"name":"Multiplexing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"M1 motorway","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_motorway"}]}
