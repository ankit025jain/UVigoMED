{"id":65572,"title":"[Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: position paper for structured therapy monitoring].","abstract":"This position paper is intended to help to structure and to standardize therapy monitoring in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). With the treatment options available today, patients with metastatic disease can often maintain good quality of life and stable disease for several years. It is crucial that once a therapy becomes insufficiently effective that it be replaced in a timely manner by a new treatment option. From a prognostic point of view, it is important that patients receive as many as possible and in the ideal case all currently available treatment options.
