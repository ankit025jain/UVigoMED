{"id":43503,"title":"Gastric cancer staging: EUS and CT.","abstract":"Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer. Only complete resection of all gross disease with negative microscopic margins (R0 resection) provides a long-term survival benefit, and the overall 5-year relative survival rate is approximately 20%. To improve survival and quality of life, new therapeutic approaches have been introduced.A total of 277 patients (171 men, 106 women) were included in this analysis. The results from the preoperative EUS and MDCT were compared to the postoperative pathological findings. A radial scanning ultrasonic endoscope was used. In patients with early gastric cancer, especially in cases confined to mucosa, endoscopic resection is performed to avoid unnecessary surgical procedures. To achieve R0 resection for locally-advanced gastric cancer, neoadjuvant treatments have been investigated.Laparoscopic surgery has been shown to improve quality of life for both early and locally advanced gastric cancer. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), which is considered to be the most precise method for locoregional staging, was commonly used for differentiating mucosal lesions from submucosal lesions. By contrast, computed tomography (CT) was used to detect the presence of distant metastasis. The difference in accuracy between the < or = 20-mm group and other groups was statistically significant for both EUS and MDCT (P = 0.026 and P = 0.044, respectively).However, recent technological advances with the helical and multi-detector scanners have provided better CT performance.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Digestive System
