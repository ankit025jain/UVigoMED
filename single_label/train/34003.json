{"id":34003,"title":"Evidence-based medicine: Craniosynostosis.","abstract":"After studying this article, the participant should be able to: (1) Make the appropriate diagnosis for each of the single-sutural synostoses, based on the physical examination. (2) Explain the functional concerns associated with these synostoses and why surgical correction is indicated. (3) Distinguish between the different types of surgical corrections available, the timing for these various interventions, and in what ways these treatments achieve overall management objectives. (4) Identify the basic goals involved in caring for the syndromic synostoses.This article provides an overview of the diagnosis and management of infants with craniosynostosis. This review also incorporates some of the treatment philosophies followed at The Craniofacial Center in Dallas, but is not intended to be an exhaustive treatise on the subject. It is designed to serve as a reference point for further in-depth study by review of the reference articles presented. This information base is then used for self-assessment and benchmarking in parts of the Maintenance of Certification process of the American Board of Plastic Surgery.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24776557","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.596675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.458563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.433689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Philosophy","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Craniosynostosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniosynostosis"},{"name":"American Board of Plastic Surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Board_of_Plastic_Surgery"},{"name":"Maintenance of Certification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_of_Certification"},{"name":"Benchmarking","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Board_of_Commissioners_for_Foreign_Missions"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification"},{"name":"Synostosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synostosis"},{"name":"Craniofacial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniofacial"},{"name":"Treatise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Corrections","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrections"},{"name":"Management by objectives","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_objectives"},{"name":"Distinguishing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguishing"},{"name":"Reference","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference"},{"name":"Dallas","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas"}]}
