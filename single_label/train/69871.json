{"id":69871,"title":"[Biological activity of lipids and photosynthetic pigments of Sargassum pallidum C. Agardh].","abstract":"The biological activity of lipids and photosynthetic pigments of the kelp Sargassum pallidum (Turner) C. Agardh has been studied. Free fatty acids and their esters demonstrated considerable antimicrobial activity against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus[ital] and Escherichia coli), yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans), and opportunistic pathogenic (Aspergilius niger) and phytopathogenic (Fusarium oxysporum, and Septoria glycines) fungi. Glyceroglycolipids and neutral lipids demonstrated moderate activity. Fucoxanthin and chlorophylls weakly suppressed the growth of microorganisms. None of the studied substances demonstrated activity against Ehrlich's carcinoma. It was shown that the season of weed harvesting affected both antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of different lipids due to changes in their fatty acid composition.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272757","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.873842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Photosynthesis","weight":0.823712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Kelp","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.79047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Plant pathology","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_pathology"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Fusarium","weight":0.75392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusarium"},{"name":"Weed","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weed"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Chlorophyll","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Ester","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.625048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Opportunistic infection","weight":0.494333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_infection"},{"name":"Sargassum","weight":0.357569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargassum"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.336785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Photosynthetic pigment","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthetic_pigment"},{"name":"Fucoxanthin","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucoxanthin"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.126224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Harvest","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0408852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Fusarium oxysporum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusarium_oxysporum"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Septoria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septoria"},{"name":"Fatty acid methyl ester","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_methyl_ester"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Aspergillus niger","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_niger"}]}
