{"id":82615,"title":"Does decompression of odontogenic cysts and cystlike lesions change the histologic diagnosis?","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to report the histopathologic findings after postdecompression definitive treatment of odontogenic cystlike lesions and determine whether the diagnosis was consistent with the pretreatment diagnosis, thereby answering the clinical question: does decompression change the histologic diagnosis?The authors implemented a retrospective cohort study from a sample of patients diagnosed with a benign odontogenic cystlike lesion and who underwent decompression followed by definitive surgery as part of their treatment. The predictor variable was treatment by decompression and the dependent variable was change in histologic diagnosis. Age, gender, and lesion location were included as variables. The ?(2) test was used for statistical analysis of the categorical data and P values less than .05 were considered statistically significant.Twenty-five cysts and cystlike lesions in 25 patients were treated with decompression followed by enucleation and curettage. The mean age was 34 years (range, 13 to 80 yr) and 56% (14) were male patients. Lesions were located in the mandible in 76% (19 of 25) of patients. Postdecompression histologic examination at the time of definitive surgical treatment was consistent with the preoperative biopsy diagnosis in 91% (10 of 11) of keratocystic odontogenic tumors, 67% (2 of 3) of glandular odontogenic cysts, 75% (3 of 4) of dentigerous cysts, and 100% (7 of 7) of cystic ameloblastomas.The histologic diagnosis at time of definitive treatment by enucleation and curettage is consistent with the predecompression diagnosis. Therefore, all lesions should be definitively treated after decompression based on the initial lesion diagnosis, with all patients placed on appropriate follow-up protocols.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576437","annotations":[{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.790693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.693393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.643949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Curettage","weight":0.623785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curettage"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.549112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.533551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.29774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.252142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.174844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Odontogenic","weight":0.0509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontogenic"},{"name":"Enucleation (microbiology)","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Covariate","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariate"},{"name":"Keratocystic odontogenic tumour","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratocystic_odontogenic_tumour"},{"name":"Categorical data","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Category theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"}]}
