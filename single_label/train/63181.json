{"id":63181,"title":"Autologous stem cell transplantation for T-cell lymphomas.","abstract":"Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a rare and heterogeneous group of T-cell malignancies characterized by a very poor outcome. The optimal treatment for PTCLs remains controversial. The role of stem cell transplantation in PTCLs has been investigated; however, no randomized control studies specifically dedicated to PTCLs are currently available. Several retrospective and prospective studies have suggested that high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) may improve the survival in patients with chemosensitive T-cell lymphoma, either upfront or as salvage treatment. This review provides a summary of the current literature with the intent to explore the role of ASCT in various clinical scenarios.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468317","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.710553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.708148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.617363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.481252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.476873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Autologous stem cell transplantation","weight":0.136252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autologous_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"Upfront","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upfront"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Holden Dealer Team","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Dealer_Team"}]}
