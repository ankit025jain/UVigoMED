{"id":66285,"title":"Predictors for recurrence after urethroplasty in pediatric and adolescent stricture urethra.","abstract":"This study aims at evaluating factors predicting recurrence of urethral stricture following urethroplasty in pediatric patients at a tertiary care center.Fifty-two patients of up to 18 years of age, who underwent urethroplasty, were reviewed. Duration of symptoms, etiology, previous intervention, and site of stricture, surgical modality, stricture length, and spongiofibrosis at stricture site, recurrence, and ancillary procedures required were recorded.Forty-two (82.76%) patients (Group I) had recurrence-free course on follow-up. Of the 10 patients with recurrence (Group II), 9 had PTS and 1 had IS (p = 0.04). Most of the factors evaluated did not differ statistically between the groups; however, length of stricture (1.8 vs. 4.3 cm, p < 0.001) and degree of spongiofibrosis (61% vs. 90%, p = 0.003) were significantly different. Seven patients with recurrence were managed with single procedures, but three required multiple procedures because of multiple recurrences. History of incision and drainage for paraurethral abscess was significantly higher (28.6% vs. 100%, p = 0.002) in patients who had multiple recurrences.Etiology, fibrosis at local site, and stricture length have significant impact on recurrence of pediatric urethral stricture disease. Associated paraurethral abscess may further compromise the outcome of urethroplasty.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726239","annotations":[{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.81172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.807676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.73452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.646629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.64065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.484501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.440833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.342869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.110498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0312962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"Incision and drainage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incision_and_drainage"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Information systems","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_systems"}]}
