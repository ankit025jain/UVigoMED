{"id":37787,"title":"Resveratrol and vitamin E rescue valproic acid-induced teratogenicity: the mechanism of action.","abstract":"1. Valproic acid (VPA) induces haemorrhagic liposis of the cervical muscles in the chicken embryo model (CEM). Vitamin E and resveratrol (RV) exhibit prominent anti-oxidative and glutathione (GSH)-protecting effects. 2. In the present study we hypothesized that vitamin E and RV would ameliorate VPA induced haemorrhagic liposis in chick embryos. To this end, 120 Day 0 fertilized eggs were divided into 10 groups (n = 12 in each). The effects of different combinations of VPA (60 mmol/L), RV (0.2 and 2.0 mmol/L) and vitamin E (0.2 and 2.0 mmol/L) applied to Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) Stage 10 (Day 1.5) embryos were tested in the CEM using established methods. 3. Both RV and vitamin E (both at 2.0 mmol/L) effectively rescued neural tube defects in the early stage CEM and inhibited the malformation rate compared with that in the control group (8.4% and 5.0% vs 36.5 Â± 3.0%, respectively; P < 0.05) and suppressed serum homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine concentrations, downregulated cervical muscular carnitine, triglycerides, H2 O2 , malondialdehyde, interleukin-6 and ACC expression (P < 0.05 for all) and upregulated CPT1 expression and GSH (P < 0.05 for both). 4. The haemorrhagic liposis of cervical muscles can be alleviated by RV and vitamin E. It appears that the main mechanism of action of RV and vitamin E in rescuing VPA-induced teratogenicity is through the suppression of reactive oxygen species and upregulation of GSH.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471772","annotations":[{"name":"Resveratrol","weight":0.878913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Teratology","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratology"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.789718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Homocysteine","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine"},{"name":"Valproic acid","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valproic_acid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.654783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.625624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Carnitine","weight":0.603045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnitine"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.561534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.466533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.449135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.413262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.39177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Neural tube defect","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube_defect"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.263635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.112303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Neural tube","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube"},{"name":"Hamburger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"}]}
