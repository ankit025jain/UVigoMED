{"id":34846,"title":"Placental expression of PHLDA2 in selective intrauterine growth restriction in monozygotic twins.","abstract":"Studies have showed that increase of placental expression of imprinted genes PHLDA2 may have a potential regulatory role in fetal IUGR (intrauterine growth restriction) in singleton. In this study, we investigate the expression level of PHLDA2 in placenta of monozygotic twins (MZT) with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) and normal MZT. Both mRNA levels and protein levels of PHLDA2 were signi?cantly increased in placenta sharings of small fetus in cases of sIUGR. Our results suggest upregulated PHLDA2 in placenta may be associated with the pathogenesis of sIUGR.
