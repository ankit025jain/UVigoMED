{"id":3895,"title":"Survey on the use of radiotherapy to treat early breast cancer following breast-conserving surgery in China.","abstract":"The use of radiotherapy to treat early stage breast cancer following breast-conserving surgery has markedly increased. The study aimed to evaluate the clinical practice of radiotherapy in China.A survey concerning the characteristics of breast-conserving radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer was distributed to all radiotherapy departments in mainland China in 2009. The results were analyzed.Three hundred and ninety-six departments replied (41.6%), and 328 (34.4%) launched breast-conserving radiotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy was the most common combination and was performed in 55.2% of the responding centers. The median time from surgery to radiotherapy was 9 weeks. Three hundred and nineteen (97.3%) centers treated the whole breast, 273 (83.2%) the supraclavicular area, 138 (43.3%) the axilla, and 85 (26.8%) the internal mammary region; 97.5% (310/319) of all centers performed irradiation of the whole breast in all candidates. One hundred and fourteen (41.8%) treated the supraclavicular area, and 37 (26.8%) treated the axilla in 1-3 positive lymph nodes. Eighty-six (31.5%) and 40 (29.0%) performed the corresponding irradiation in N 2-3 patients. Fifty-six (72.9%) treated the internal mammary region for tumors of the center or inner quadrant. The conformal technique was used in 51.8% of the centers.Although a consensus has been reached, debate still exists about the target of postoperative radiotherapy in early stage breast cancer.","date":"2014-10-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25343545","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.766329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.722654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"China","weight":0.666115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.639524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.555837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.411873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.411873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.319691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.225149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mainland China","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Conformal map","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Ship naming and launching","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_naming_and_launching"},{"name":"Pan-Slavic colors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Slavic_colors"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Center (basketball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)"},{"name":"Supraclavicular nerves","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supraclavicular_nerves"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Internal thoracic artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_thoracic_artery"}]}
