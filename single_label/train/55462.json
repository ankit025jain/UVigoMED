{"id":55462,"title":"Pain and discomfort in the anophthalmic socket.","abstract":"The aim of this review is to summarize causes of pain and discomfort in the anophthalmic socket and to aid the clinician in evaluating anophthalmic patients.Causes of pain and discomfort can be categorized into dysfunctional orbit/anophthalmic socket, phantom eye pain, and psychological/psychiatric factors. Recent research has brought attention to the role of prosthesis deposits in mucous formation, meibomian gland dysfunction causing dry socket, and the anophthalmic patients' experience of phantom eye pain.Anophthalmic patients may experience pain and discomfort for a variety of reasons. The treating physician needs to recognize this as treatment options are distinctly different.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24878963","annotations":[{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.727672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.65303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.524799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Meibomian gland","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meibomian_gland"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.118306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alveolar osteitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_osteitis"},{"name":"Anophthalmia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anophthalmia"},{"name":"Ghost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost"},{"name":"Prohibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition"},{"name":"Sediment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"}]}
