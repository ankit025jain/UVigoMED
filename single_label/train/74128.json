{"id":74128,"title":"Hand tumors: II. Benign and malignant bone tumors of the hand.","abstract":"The incidence of both benign and malignant bone tumors arising in the hand is relatively low in comparison with other locations. Although the overwhelming majority of these tumors are benign, even benign tumors can be locally destructive and compromise hand function. Intralesional tumor excision is the most appropriate surgical intervention for many benign bone tumors of the hand; however, destructive or malignant tumors may require wide local excision or even amputation to achieve complete tumor eradication. The purpose of this review article is to provide an overview of the pertinent benign and malignant bone tumors that may be encountered by hand surgeons. Clinical presentation, radiographic features, recommended workup, and available treatment options are all reviewed.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867740","annotations":[{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.809594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.718795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Bone tumor","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_tumor"},{"name":"Wide local excision","weight":0.606156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_local_excision"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Review article","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_article"},{"name":"Eradication of infectious diseases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
