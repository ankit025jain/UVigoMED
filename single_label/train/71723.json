{"id":71723,"title":"[Effect of curcumin in inducing apoptosis of MDA-MB-213 cells by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress].","abstract":"To explore the possible mechanism of curcumin in inducing the apoptosis of breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231.Curcumin of different concentrations at 0, 10 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 micromol x L(-1) were used to intervene breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 for 24 hours. MTT was used to observe its effect on the proliferation of breast cancer cells. The flow cytometry was used to detect its effect on the cell apoptosis. The real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot was used to assess the expression levels of GRP78 and CHOP in breast cancer cells.Curcumin could inhibit the proliferative ability of breast cancer cells by inducing them in a concentration-dependent manner. Curcumin could significantly increase the expression levels of GRP78 and CHOP in breast cancer cells.Curcumin could induce the apoptosis of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25039189","annotations":[{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Curcumin","weight":0.835569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcumin"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.544226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.358761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.329146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"CHOP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOP"},{"name":"Unfolded protein response","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfolded_protein_response"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Fiberglass","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Barcelona Metro line 1","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Metro_line_1"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
