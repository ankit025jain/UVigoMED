{"id":60660,"title":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: state of the art and beyond.","abstract":"In the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), select genomic studies can assist in risk stratification of newly diagnosed patients. Chemoimmunotherapy targeting CD20 offers a survival advantage in symptomatic patients both with and without these high-risk genetic features, though patients with del(17p13.1) have poor outcomes and require specific intervention. Obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil is a treatment standard for untreated elderly patients and is superior to rituximab plus chlorambucil. In the setting of relapsed CLL, the new kinase inhibitors have the potential to completely change the treatment paradigm of CLL.
