{"id":82759,"title":"The influence of different registration positions on condyle displacement in symptomatic patients.","abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate effects of different registration positions on the condyle-disk position changes in the mandibular fossa in symptomatic individuals.Vertical and sagittal condyle position and thickness of the bilaminar zone were measured by magnetic resonance imaging during maximal intercuspation (MI) and with jigs in Gothic arch tracing guided centric relation (DIR method [Dynamics and Intraoral Registration]) and retruded contact position (RCP). Participants were 26 patients seeking treatment for temporomandibular disorders. Condyle and disk position in the fossa were calculated in the parasagittal plane.Significant differences were found for MI, DIR, and RCP for thickness of bilaminar zone and sagittal condyle position, dependent on diagnosis and registration position for vertical and sagittal condyle position and thickness of bilaminar zone.DIR position ensures the widest posterior space for the retrodiskal tissues and the slightest sagittal difference between condyle zenith and glenoid fossa.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528791","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.782814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Glenoid cavity","weight":0.778431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenoid_cavity"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.736259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.623517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mandibular fossa","weight":0.532155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandibular_fossa"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.118784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ogive","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogive"},{"name":"Gothic architecture","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Zenith","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Image registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Fossa (animal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossa_(animal)"},{"name":"Trilaminar blastocyst","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilaminar_blastocyst"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0153226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Tracing (software)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_(software)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"}]}
