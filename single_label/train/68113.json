{"id":68113,"title":"Phosphate levels in patients treated with low-flux haemodialysis, pre-dilution haemofiltration and haemodiafiltration: post hoc analysis of a multicentre, randomized and controlled trial.","abstract":"Whether convective therapies allow better control of serum phosphate (P) is still undefined, and no data are available concerning on-line haemofiltration (HF). The objectives of the study are to evaluate the effect of convective treatments (CTs) on P levels in comparison with low-flux haemodialysis (HD) and to evaluate the correlates of serum phosphate in a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial.This analysis was performed in the database of a multicentre, open label and randomized controlled study in which 146 chronic HD patients from 27 Italian centres were randomly assigned to HD (70 patients) or CTs: on-line pre-dilution HF (36 patients) or on-line pre-dilution haemodiafiltration (40 patients).CTs did not affect P (P = 0.526), calcium (Ca) (P = 0.849) and parathyroid hormone levels (P = 0.622). P levels were associated with the use of phosphate binders including aluminium-based phosphate binders (P < 0.001) and sevelamer (P < 0.001), pre-dialysis bicarbonate levels (P < 0.001) and pre-dialysis blood K levels (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis (generalized linear model), serum P was again largely unassociated with CTs (P = 0.631). Notably, participating centres were by far the strongest independent correlate of serum P, explaining 45.3% of the variance of serum P over the trial and this association was confirmed at multivariate analysis. Bicarbonate (P < 0.001) and, to a weaker extent, serum K (P = 0.032) were independently related to serum P.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24557989","annotations":[{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Open-label trial","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-label_trial"},{"name":"Generalized linear model","weight":0.781175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.663964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.615997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.613966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.546948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.496147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.400503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.378818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hemofiltration","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemofiltration"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.372915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.366164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Bicarbonate","weight":0.251389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate"},{"name":"Linear model","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_model"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.167001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.0779046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Phosphate binders","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate_binders"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Linear function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function"},{"name":"Post-hoc analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-hoc_analysis"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Binder (material)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binder_(material)"},{"name":"Convection","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection"}]}
