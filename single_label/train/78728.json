{"id":78728,"title":"Image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with vestibular schwannoma. A clinical study.","abstract":"Local tumor control and functional outcome after linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) for vestibular schwannoma (VS) were assessed.In all, 250 patients with VS were treated: 190 patients with tumors <?2 cm diameter underwent SRS and 60 patients with tumors >2 to 3.5 cm underwent FSRT. Dose prescription for all cases with SRS (n?=?190, 76?%) was 13.5 Gy. For FSRT, mainly two hypofractionated schedules (n?=?60, 24?%) with either 7 fractions of 5 Gy (total dose: 35 Gy; n?=?35) or 11 fractions of 3.8 Gy (total dose: 41.8 Gy; n?=?16) were used. The primary endpoint was local tumor control. Secondary endpoints were symptomatic control and morbidity.The median follow-up was 33.8 months. The 3-year local tumor control was 88.9?%. Local control for SRS and FSRT was 88 and 92?%, respectively. For FSRT with 35 and 41.8 Gy, local control was 90 and 100?%, respectively. There were no acute reactions exceeding grade I. In 61 cases (24.4?% of the entire cohort), trigeminal neuralgia was reported prior to treatment. At last follow-up, 16.3?% (10/61) of those patients reported relief of pain. Regarding facial nerve dysfunction, 45 patients (18?%) presented with symptoms prior to RT. At the last follow-up, 13.3% (6/45) of those patients reported a relief of dysesthesia.Using SRS to treat small VS results in good local control rates. FSRT for larger lesions also seems effective. Severe treatment-related complications are not frequent. Therefore, image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy is an appropriate alternative to microsurgery for patients with VS.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589920","annotations":[{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.826989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiosurgery","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosurgery"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Trigeminal neuralgia","weight":0.79374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_neuralgia"},{"name":"Schwannoma","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwannoma"},{"name":"Dysesthesia","weight":0.773478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysesthesia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.760924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Trigeminal nerve","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_nerve"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.605765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Vestibular schwannoma","weight":0.510645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_schwannoma"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.485807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.469872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neuralgia","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralgia"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.33303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.317921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0814058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"1061","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1061"},{"name":"645","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/645"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Sex reassignment surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"RT (TV network)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)"},{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Radiation hardening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening"}]}
