{"id":4490,"title":"[The concept and definition of locomotive syndrome in a super-aged society].","abstract":"The population of elderly individuals who need nursing care is rapidly increasing in Japan. Locomotive syndrome involves a decrease in mobility due to locomotive organ dysfunction, and increases risk for dependency on nursing care service. Because gait speed and chair stand time are correlated with such risks, patients with locomotive syndrome are assessed using brief methods such as the two-step test, which involves dividing the maximum stride length by the height of the patient, and the stand-up test, which involves standing on one or both legs at different heights. One leg standing and squatting are recommended as beneficial locomotive home exercises. Locomotive syndrome has been recognized widely in Japan, and included in the National Health Promotion Movement (2013-2022).","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509791","annotations":[{"name":"Society","weight":0.503407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.361225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.351825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.244055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.104275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Health promotion","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_promotion"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Stand-up comedy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy"},{"name":"Stride (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stride_(music)"},{"name":"Chairman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Organ (music)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(music)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Promotion (marketing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(marketing)"},{"name":"Squatting","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting"},{"name":"Locomotive","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive"}]}
