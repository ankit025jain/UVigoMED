{"id":22373,"title":"Imaging pulmonary infection: classic signs and patterns.","abstract":"The purposes of this article are to describe common and uncommon imaging signs and patterns of pulmonary infections and to discuss their underlying anatomic and pathophysiologic basis.Imaging plays an integral role in the diagnosis and management of suspected pulmonary infections and may reveal useful signs on chest radiographs and CT scans. Detected early, these signs can often be used to predict the causative agent and pathophysiologic mechanism and possibly to optimize patient care.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555584","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.631971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.57535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.46357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.189447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.109583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.0290314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0214857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0119069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"}]}
