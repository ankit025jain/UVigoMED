{"id":23796,"title":"Breakthrough candidemia due to multidrug-resistant Candida glabrata during prophylaxis with a low dose of micafungin.","abstract":"We identified a case of breakthrough candidemia in a 25-year-old patient receiving micafungin prophylaxis (50 mg/day). Five Candida glabrata isolates were obtained from blood cultures and were classified as multidrug-resistant isolates, since all of them exhibited high MICs for echinocandin and azole drugs. A mutation (S663F) in hot spot 1 of the FKS2 gene was found in all five isolates. This mutation yielded a 1,3-?-D-glucan synthase enzyme with highly reduced sensitivities to echinocandin drugs.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468776","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.934224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Azole","weight":0.807895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azole"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.775131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.770415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Fungemia","weight":0.735577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungemia"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.637477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Micafungin","weight":0.476026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micafungin"},{"name":"Candida glabrata","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_glabrata"},{"name":"Echinocandin","weight":0.317693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinocandin"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"663","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/663"},{"name":"Hotspot (geology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_(geology)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
