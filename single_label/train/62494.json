{"id":62494,"title":"Sclerouveitis associated with Rosai-Dorfman disease in an HIV-infected patient.","abstract":"To describe a case of Rosai-Dorfman-associated sclerouveitis in an HIV-infected patient.Case report.A 49-year-old man with HIV had bilateral eye pain, redness, photophobia, and multiple systemic complaints. He underwent serial ocular examinations, abdomen/pelvis CT scan, and lymph node biopsy.Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed bilateral, nongranulomatous anterior uveitis and anterior scleritis. Biopsy of a retroperitoneal lymph node identified on CT revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells involving fibroadipose tissue, indicating Rosai-Dorfman disease.This is the first report of sclerouveitis in Rosai-Dorfman disease. Rosai-Dorfman is typically self-limiting, occurring rarely in HIV.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564426","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Scleritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleritis"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Photophobia","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photophobia"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.833344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.82223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.74879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.717091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Histiocyte","weight":0.418061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiocyte"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.102441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Symmetry in biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
