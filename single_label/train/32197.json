{"id":32197,"title":"Permanent epicardial pacing lead implantation for scheduled multistage operations in Fontan candidate.","abstract":"The use of an epicardial pacing lead may be essential in pediatric patients with rhythm disturbances. In patients with single-ventricle physiology who need scheduled multistage operations, the lead could be an obstacle because of the induction of tight adhesions and the need for dissection in the next operation. We propose a novelÂ reproducible technique for the placement of an epicardial pacing lead followed by easy dissection of the entire length of the lead in the next operation in neonates or young infants who need multistage operations.
