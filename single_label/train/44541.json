{"id":44541,"title":"Chemosaturation with percutaneous hepatic perfusions of melphalan for hepatic metastases: experience from two European centers.","abstract":"Chemosaturation with percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP; Hepatic CHEMOSAT(Â®) Delivery System; Delcath Systems Inc, USA) is a minimally invasive, repeatable regional therapy for unresectable hepatic metastases. It uses a system of catheters and filters to isolate hepatic venous blood from the systemic circulation, allowing delivery of high-dose chemotherapy to the hepatic artery. Effluent hepatic venous blood is filtered before being returned to the systemic circulation, thereby reducing exposure to chemotherapy. We describe our experiences with chemosaturation-PHP at 2 European centers.14 patients presented unresectable hepatic metastases from solid tumors; 13 received 1?-?3 sessions of chemosaturation-PHP. Melphalan 2.0 (n?=?1) or 3.0 (n?=?12) mg/kg was given as a 30-minute infusion into the hepatic artery. 12 patients were evaluable for tumor response.One complete (cholangiocarcinoma, n?=?1) and 6 partial responses (ocular, n?=?3 or cutaneous melanoma, n?=?3) were observed, 5 patients had stable disease (ocular melanoma, n?=?3; breast cancer, n?=?1; gastric cancer, n?=?1). Mild to moderate filter-related toxicity (i.?e. thrombocytopenia, anemia) was observed immediately post-procedure. Grade 3/4 melphalan-related pancytopenia developed after 1?-?2 weeks. All hematological events were managed effectively with transfusions and/or other supportive measures. The new high-efficiency filter showed milder toxicity and faster recovery. In one case, chemosaturation-PHP was abandoned prematurely due to heparin-induced vaginal bleeding, and one patient died due to retroperitoneal hemorrhage from heparin anti-coagulation.Chemosaturation-PHP for non-resectable liver metastases is a feasible treatment option when performed by an experienced multi-disciplinary team. It may be a promising regional therapy for patients with no effective treatment options.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Digestive System
