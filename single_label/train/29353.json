{"id":29353,"title":"Environmental responses and phage susceptibility in foodborne pathogens: implications for improving applications in food safety.","abstract":"Bacterial foodborne pathogens can rapidly respond to changes in their environment, granting them the ability to survive under a broad range of conditions. In doing so, they undergo physiological alterations that can influence the efficacy of detection and interventions used in the food industry. As bacteriophage-based applications in food safety are gaining traction, it is crucial that we consider the effect the environment can have on phage-host interactions. This review aims to bridge knowledge of the responses of bacterial foodborne pathogens to changing environmental conditions with our understanding of phage-host interactions. An improved understanding of these intersections will aid in the development of bacteriophage-based products for the detection, biocontrol and biosanitation of foodborne pathogens.
