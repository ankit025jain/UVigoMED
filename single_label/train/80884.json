{"id":80884,"title":"Dipetalonema evansi infection in camels of Iran's central area.","abstract":"Totally 294 dromedary camels of different ages and both sexes slaughtered at slaughterhouses in Yazd, Isfahan and Kerman provinces were inspected for infection with Dipetalonema evansi. Blood smears of all camels and carcasses of 125 of them (100 from Isfahan and 25 from Yazd) were studied for larva and adult forms of the parasite. Microfilariae were found in peripheral blood smears of 38 out of 294 (12.92%) tested camels, while 20 out of 125 camels (13.89%) harbored D. evansi adult worms in at least one region in their testicle, epididymis, spermatic cord, lung and heart. Two of infected males had adult forms of the parasite in all studied organs simultaneously. Pathological study of infected tissues revealed sections of parasite, severe acute and chronic inflammation, fibrosis and atrophy. D. evansi is endemic and constitutes an important health problem to camels in Iran's central desert, resulting in impaired working capacity and lowered productivity.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505989","annotations":[{"name":"Epididymis","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epididymis"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.907678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.451527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Spermatic cord","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatic_cord"},{"name":"Camel","weight":0.325594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.201595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Carrion","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion"},{"name":"Desert","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert"},{"name":"Blood film","weight":0.0900421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_film"},{"name":"Worm","weight":0.0540354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm"},{"name":"Slaughterhouse","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0354391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Dromedary","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromedary"},{"name":"Productivity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Animal slaughter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_slaughter"}]}
