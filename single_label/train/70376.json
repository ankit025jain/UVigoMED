{"id":70376,"title":"[Guidelines for external radiotherapy and brachytherapy: introduction to the 2nd edition. Société française de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO)].","abstract":"In 2007, a first edition was published with the objective to produce guidelines for optimization, harmonization and homogenization of practices in external radiation therapy in France. The second edition, including brachytherapy, has the same objective and takes into account recent technologic improvements (intensity modulation radiation therapy, stereotactic radiotherapy, and 3-dimension brachytherapy) and recent results of the literature. The first part is about daily use of general principles (quality, security, image-guided radiation therapy) and the second is to describe each step of treatment of main cancers.
