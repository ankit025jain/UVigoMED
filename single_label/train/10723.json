{"id":10723,"title":"The ratio of transforming growth factor-?1/bone morphogenetic protein-7 in the progression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition contributes to rat liver fibrosis.","abstract":"This study was designed to show whether rat liver epithelial cells could undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby directly contributing to liver fibrosis. The role of the ratio of transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1)/bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) was evaluated in the progression of EMT or mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Primary rat liver epithelial cells were stimulated with different ratios of TGF-?1/BMP-7 and examined for evidence of transition to a mesenchymal or epithelial phenotype. Liver sections were labeled to detect antigens associated with liver epithelial cells [E-cadherin (E-cad)], EMT [fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP-1), vimentin], myofibroblasts [?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA)], and intracellular signal-transduction mediated by forming liver fibrosis undergo EMT, resulting in the formation of invasive fibroblasts; this process may be driven or impeded by a response to local TGF-?1 or BMP-7. BMP-7 downregulated ?-SMA and phosphorylated Smad2/3. Stimulation of cultured cells with TGF-?1 induced the expression of pSmad2/3, FSP-1, and ?-SMA. Stimulation of cultured cells with BMP-7 induced the expression of E-cad. We demonstrated that the cells upregulated E-cad release compared with untreated cells, but TGF-?1 was different. We found that the equilibrium of the ratio of TGF-?1/BMP-7 was 1/10. In summary, the mechanism for this process was not determined. Demonstration of the contribution of what the ratio of TGF-?1/BMP-7 induced to EMT to the chronic liver diseases would provide a new basis for understanding pathogenesis and potential treatment.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634122","annotations":[{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein","weight":0.909087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein"},{"name":"Vimentin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimentin"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.794399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.791193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.750305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Myofibroblast","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofibroblast"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.604408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"SMAD (protein)","weight":0.378002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMAD_(protein)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.309291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.253709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.13183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein 7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein_7"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Chemical equilibrium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Transition metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
