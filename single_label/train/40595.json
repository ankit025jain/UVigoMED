{"id":40595,"title":"[Effects of natural antioxidants on the content of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates in rat's gastric mucosal cells under experimental ulceration].","abstract":"Effects of natural antioxidants on the contents of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates in rat's gastric mucosal cells under experimental ethanolinduced ulceration have been studied. A significant decrease in the contents of neutral and phospholipids was found under experimental ulceration and their increase was detected under addition of squalene and ammivit. Under ulceration we found a significant decrease of protein fractions with molecular weight within the range of 11-138 kDa, galactose and fucose contents. Following addition of squalene and ammivit, a normalization of these parameters was observed.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25007524","annotations":[{"name":"Fucose","weight":0.810769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucose"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Galactose","weight":0.724645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.703714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Phospholipid","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipid"},{"name":"Molecular weight","weight":0.597221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_weight"},{"name":"Squalene","weight":0.282034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squalene"},{"name":"Gastric mucosa","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_mucosa"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.0658699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0261065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
