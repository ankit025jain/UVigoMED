{"id":69521,"title":"Metastasis of prostate cancer and melanoma cells in a preclinical in vivo mouse model is enhanced by L-plastin expression and phosphorylation.","abstract":"Tumor cell migration and metastasis require dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, the F-actin cross-linking and stabilizing protein L-plastin, originally described as a leukocyte specific protein, is aberrantly expressed in several non-hematopoietic malignant tumors. Therefore, it has been discussed as a tumor marker. However, systematic in vivo analyses of the functional relevance of L-plastin for tumor cell metastasis were so far lacking.We investigated the relevance of L-plastin expression and phosphorylation by ectopical expression of L-plastin in human melanoma cells (MV3) and knock-down of endogenous L-plastin in prostate cancer (PC3M). The growth and metastatic potential of tumor cells expressing no L-plastin, phosphorylatable or non-phosphorylatable L-plastin was analyzed in a preclinical mouse model after subcutaneous and intracardial injection of the tumor cells.Knock-down of endogenous L-plastin in human prostate carcinoma cells led to reduced tumor cell growth and metastasis. Vice versa, and in line with these findings, ectopic expression of L-plastin in L-plastin negative melanoma cells significantly increased the number of metastases. Strikingly, the metastasis promoting effect of L-plastin was not observed if a non-phosphorylatable L-plastin mutant was expressed.Our data provide the first in vivo evidence that expression of L-plastin promotes tumor metastasis and, importantly, that this effect depends on an additionally required phosphorylation of L-plastin. In conclusion, these findings imply that for determining the importance of tumor-associated proteins like L-plastin a characterization of posttranslational modifications is indispensable.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438191","annotations":[{"name":"Heart","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Cytoskeleton","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.806801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Posttranslational modification","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttranslational_modification"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.698635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.693139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.632094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.511358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Ectopic expression","weight":0.502548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_expression"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.487785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.381969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.376036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.294432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"PC3","weight":0.18915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC3"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.131728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
