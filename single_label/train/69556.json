{"id":69556,"title":"A ROS/STAT3/HIF-1? signaling cascade mediates EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer cell invasion.","abstract":"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been known to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and prostate cancer cell progression. However, a detailed underlying mechanism by which EGF induces EMT and prostate cancer cell progression remained to be answered. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1? and TWIST1 are transcription factors implicated in EMT and cancer metastasis. The purpose of this study is to determine the underlying mechanism of EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer invasion.siRNAs were used to silence genes. Immunoblotting, quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence analysis were used to examine protein or mRNA expression. Modified Boyden chamber and invasion assay kit with Matrigel-coated inserts were used to determine prostate cancer cell migration and invasion, respectively.We observed that EGF induced HIF-1? expression and morphological change of prostate cancer epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells. Silencing HIF-1? expression dramatically reduced EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer cell EMT. Conversely, transfection of the cells with HIF-1? siRNA reversed the reduced E-cadherin expression by EGF. Pretreatment of the cells with pharmacological inhibitors of reactive oxygen species [ROS, N-acetylcysteine (NAC)] and STAT3 (WP1066) but not p38 MAPK (SB203580) significantly reduced EGF-induced HIF-1? mRNA and protein expression. Further, pretreatment of the cells with NAC attenuated EGF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition, we showed that TWIST1 mediated EGF-induced N-cadherin expression, leading to prostate cancer invasion.We demonstrate a mechanism by which EGF promotes prostate cancer cell progression through a ROS/STAT3/HIF-1?/TWIST1/N-cadherin signaling cascade, providing novel biomarkers and promising therapeutic targets for prostate cancer cell progression.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24435707","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering
