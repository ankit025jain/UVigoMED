{"id":53250,"title":"Effect of increased glucose levels on short-term outcome in hypertensive spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.","abstract":"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can be a devastating event. Increased glucose levels in the plasma may be related to poor outcomes; however, the precise association remains unclear.We retrospectively assessed 116 patients with hypertensive ICH. Glucose level in the plasma was assessed at days 0, 1, and 3. Outcome variables were mortality within 7 and 30days and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at day 14 after ICH onset.Twenty deaths had occurred by day 7, and the 30-day mortality rate was 31.9%. Hyperglycemia at day 0 was significantly more common in patients who died within 7days or 30days. Hyperglycemia at day 1 was more common in patients with an NIHSS score >15 on admission and at day 14. No differences in glucose levels were found between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Among non-diabetic patients, higher glucose levels were related to poorer outcomes (death or an NIHSS score >15). In multivariate analysis, glucose levels >140mg/dL at day 1 were related to the 30-day mortality (hazard ratio=2.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.15-6.12, p=0.02), and glucose levels >160mg/dL at day 1 were associated with an NIHSS score >15 at day 14 (odds ratio=3.08; 95% CI=0.9-10.5, p=0.07). White blood cell counts were directly associated with poorer outcomes and significantly correlated to glucose levels.Initially increased glucose levels and increased levels within 24h of ICH onset were related to poorer outcomes. Altered glucose metabolism may be due to inflammatory cell activation. Further studies are needed to clarify the association between immune activation and glucose metabolism after ICH onset.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529227","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"National Institutes of Health","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.850716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.798844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cerebral hemorrhage","weight":0.743165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.736555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.687712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.54067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.496564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.459516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
