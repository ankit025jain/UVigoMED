{"id":68636,"title":"Preconditioning with gabexate is superior to inosine for ameliorating acute renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to compare the protease inhibitor gabexate with widely used inosine for reducing renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.A total of 48 rats were divided into 4 groups of 12 and administered gabexate, inosine, normal saline (NS), or nothing by injection through the vena dorsalis of the penis. Then all rats were subjected to right nephrectomy and 30-minute warm ischemia of the left kidney. At 24 and 48 hours after reperfusion, blood samples were collected from the inferior vena cava and serum creatinine (SCr) was assayed. Left kidney tissue was homogenized and used to assay malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The tissue was also analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, TUNEL staining, and NF-?B immunohistochemistry.SCr level decreased after reperfusion more in the gabexate group than in the other groups. Reperfused kidney tissue in the gabexate group showed lower MDA levels but higher SOD activity than did tissue in the inosine and saline groups, as well as lower pathology scores based on HE staining, lower necrosis index, and lower levels of NF-?B expression (all P < .05). Tissue in the inosine and saline groups showed similar necrosis index and NF-?B expression (P > .05).Preconditioning with gabexate is superior to preconditioning with inosine for ameliorating rat renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Future studies are needed to verify the effects of gabexate in the clinic, especially for kidney transplantation.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507023","annotations":[{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.868762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.798359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.779706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.768876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.677919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.663186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Inferior vena cava","weight":0.635324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.626216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.582755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.438034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.320123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.304537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.206567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.182633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Inosine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inosine"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"}]}
