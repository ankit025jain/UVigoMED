{"id":46767,"title":"Expression of CD24, p21, p53, and c-myc in alpha-fetoprotein-producing gastric cancer: Correlation with clinicopathologic characteristics and survival.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of CD24, p21, p53, and c-myc in lesions of patients with Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric cancer and their correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosis.One hundred and four patients with AFP-producing gastric cancer were included into this study. The levels of CD24, p21, p53, and c-myc were examined by immunohistochemistry.The prognostic value of these biological markers and the correlation between biological markers and clinicopathological factors were investigated.The percentages of positive expression of CD24, p21, p53, and c-myc were 31.7%, 77.9%, 75.0%, and 66.3%, respectively. CD24 expression correlated with histological grade (P?=?0.045) and Lauren type (P?=?0.006); p21expression with Borrmann type (P?=?0.035); c-myc expression with Borrmann type (P?=?0.029). p21 expression was related with poor survival in univariate analysis (P?=?0.016). Multivariate analysis showed that p21 expression, vascular invasion, and pathological stage were defined as independent prognostic factors.The expression of p21 was an independent prognostic factor for patients with AFP-producing gastric cancer.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619835","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.858491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.686474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.606261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.361859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.300781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"CD24","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD24"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"P21","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P21"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
