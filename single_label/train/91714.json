{"id":91714,"title":"Deaths and near deaths of healthy newborn infants while bed sharing on maternity wards.","abstract":"Our aim was to evaluate programs promoting bed sharing on maternity wards and determining ways to reduce these risks.Members of the National Association of Medical Examiners were contacted requesting information on deaths of healthy infants while bed sharing on maternity wards.Fifteen deaths and three near deaths are reported. One or more factors that increase the risk of bed sharing were present in all cases. Accidental suffocation was deemed the most likely cause of these incidents.Cases of infant deaths and near deaths while bed sharing on maternity wards are under reported. The 'Baby Friendly' (BF) initiative in maternity hospitals to promote breastfeeding is endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The BF initiative encourages prolonged skin-to-skin contact and bed sharing. Education of mothers and more efficient monitoring should significantly reduce the risk of maternity ward bed sharing.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480904","annotations":[{"name":"American Academy of Pediatrics","weight":0.920976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.824397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Maternity","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.515908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.456036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Asphyxia","weight":0.405469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia"},{"name":"Infant mortality","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Friendly_Hospital_Initiative"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.252868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Exhibition game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game"},{"name":"Ward (LDS Church)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(LDS_Church)"},{"name":"Initiative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative"},{"name":"National Association of Professional Base Ball Players","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Professional_Base_Ball_Players"},{"name":"Ward (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(law)"},{"name":"The Baby","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baby"}]}
