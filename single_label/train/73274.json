{"id":73274,"title":"[Comparison of the chemoimmunotherapeutic effect of doxorubicin and bafilomycin-A1 in mouse neuroblastoma cells].","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the ability of the drugs doxorubicin and Bafilomycin-A1(Baf-A1)to promote an immune reaction following the induction of cell death in a mouse neuroblastoma model. Neuro-2a cells were cultured in medium containing doxorubicin or Baf-A1. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells(BM-DCs)were co-cultured with neuro-2A cells that were grown in doxorubicin- or Baf-A1-containing media, and phagocytosis of neuro-2a cells by the BN-DCs was evaluated. Additionally, dead neuro-2a cells were co-cultured with CD8a + lymphocytes and BM-DCs, and the proliferation of CD8a + cells was evaluated. Interferon-g(IFN-g)production was used as an indexof the immune response. Dead neuro-2a cells treated with doxorubicin were phagocytosed effectively compared to the cells treated with Baf-A1. However, phagocytosis of cells treated with Baf-A1 was promoted after stimulation with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN). When CD8a + cells were co-cultured with BM-DCs and doxorubicin-treated neuro-2a cells, CD8a + lymphocyte proliferation was observed. There was no statistical difference in IFN-g secretion between the doxorubicin-treated and Baf-A1-treated cells. However, after stimulation by CpG-ODN, IFN-g production was more effectively observed in the Baf-A1-treated cells. Induction of cell death by doxorubicin or Baf-A1 could possibly enhance antitumor immunity in patients receiving chemotherapy for neuroblastoma. Selection of anti-tumor agents and stimulation of BM-DCs with a toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist is considered important in promoting antitumor activity after chemotherapy.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917008","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.914325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.886974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Phagocytosis","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.829799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.782792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.760555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.548814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.528052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.413047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.372176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.356982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"}]}
