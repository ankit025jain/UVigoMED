{"id":68484,"title":"[Gastric metastases: not only identified at autopsies].","abstract":"Metastases to the stomach from an extra-digestive neoplasm are an unusual event, identified in less than 2% of cancer patients at autopsy (between 1.7% to 5%). The stomach may be involved by hematogenous spread from a distant primary tumor (most commonly lung, breast and melanoma). Tumors of neighboring organs, such as esophagus, pancreas and gallbladder, may reach the stomach by continuity or by lymphatic-hematogenous spread. Endoscopic routine studies with biopsies have improved the diagnosis of this pathology. Nevertheless, in some cases the histologic study is a false negative because the neoplasia can be placed in the deepest layers of the stomach. We report the case of a 56-year-old man who presented a gastric metastasis of a high gradeuro thelial carcinoma of urinary bladder and we review the literature.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24516960","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"False negative","weight":0.774983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_negative"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
