{"id":57132,"title":"Oral dydrogesterone treatment during early pregnancy to prevent recurrent pregnancy loss and its role in modulation of cytokine production: a double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled trial.","abstract":"To study the impact of administration of dydrogesterone in early pregnancy on pregnancy outcome and its correlation with Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels.Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.A medical college and its associated hospital.Women with either: [1] a history of idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), in either a dydrogesterone group or a placebo group, or [2] no history of miscarriage.Dydrogesterone 20 mg/day from confirmation of pregnancy to 20 weeks of gestation.Occurrence of another pregnancy loss and concentrations of T-helper (Th)1 (interferon-? and tumor necrosis factor-?) and Th2 (interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10) cytokines in serum at recruitment (4-8 weeks of gestation) and at abortion or 20 weeks of gestation, using commercially available ELISA kits.Occurrence of another abortion after 3 consecutive abortions was significantly higher (29 of 173; 16.76%) in women with RPL compared with healthy pregnant controls (6 of 174; 3.45%). Risk of occurrence of miscarriage after 3 abortions was 2.4 times higher in the placebo group vs. the treatment group (risk ratio=2.4, 95% CI=1.3-5.9). Mean gestational age at delivery (excluding those aborted before 20 weeks of gestation) increased significantly in the dydrogesterone group (38.01±1.96 weeks) compared with the placebo group (37.23±2.41 weeks). Baby weight was significantly lower in the placebo group (2421.4±321.6 g) compared with the healthy pregnant controls (2545.3±554.3 g). At recruitment, serum IL-4 and tumor necrosis factor-? levels were significantly lower in the RPL group compared with the healthy pregnant controls. However, serum interferon-? level was significantly higher in the RPL group (8.87±0.72 pg/mL) compared with the healthy pregnant controls (8.08±1.27 pg/mL).The present study supports the use of dydrogesterone in women with recurrent abortions to improve pregnancy outcome, such as a reduction in abortions and improved gestational age and baby weight at delivery. However, these outcomes were not modulated by Th1 and Th2 cytokine production.CTRI/2010/091/000373.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241364","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.76892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.724265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.647087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.57308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.526092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.427604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.359972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.354608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.23879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.220801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.214558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.148859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.124383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.065098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0629825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Habitual abortion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_abortion"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"College","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Teenage pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
