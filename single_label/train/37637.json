{"id":37637,"title":"Respiratory function and near infrared spectroscopy recording during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in an extremely preterm newborn.","abstract":"We describe a case highlighting several controversial and important topics regarding neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Current neonatal guidelines recommend a 3:1 compression:ventilation ratio; however, the most effective ratio of delivering chest compressions (CC) remains controversial. We report a case of a male infant at 24 weeks' postmenstrual age weighing 650 g on a background of preterm labor. At initial assessment the infant appeared floppy and apneic with a heart rate (HR) of 50-60 beats/min. Mask ventilation was ineffective, thus continuous CC (90/min) with asynchronous ventilations (60/min) was started. HR, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, cerebral oxygenation, respiratory function, and exhaled carbon dioxide (ECO2) were continuously measured during CPR. Return of spontaneous circulation defined as HR >60/min was achieved after 90 s of CPR. Mask leak significantly increased during CC. During bradycardia (HR ?50/min), ECO2 indicated correct tube placement and an increase of ECO2 >12 mm Hg was associated with rapid increase in HR >60/min.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481290","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.811497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.784078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.757154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.730973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Bradycardia","weight":0.713027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradycardia"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.69026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infrared spectroscopy","weight":0.644788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.430595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.326785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.190214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Near-infrared spectroscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-infrared_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Floppy disk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leak"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"}]}
