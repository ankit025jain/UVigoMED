{"id":30149,"title":"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) in cerebral arteries of subjects at high risk for VZV reactivation.","abstract":"With a decline in varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific cell-mediated immunity, VZV can reactivate, infect cerebral arteries and cause stroke. Previous studies of cerebral arteries from subjects without a history of transient ischemic attacks or stroke revealed no VZV DNA or VZV antigen; however, VZV DNA and VZV antigen were found in the cerebral arteries of a subject with diabetes, a known risk factor for VZV reactivation and zoster. The present study analyzed an additional 55 cerebral arteries from 18 subjects with co-morbidities that may increase risk of VZV reactivation: a history of alcohol abuse, tricyclic antidepressant intoxication, cocaine abuse, HIV or being over age 70 years. VZV antigen was detected in 24 (44%) cerebral arteries from 14 (78%) subjects.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556269","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Tricyclic antidepressant","weight":0.810198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.794493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.729617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.66851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.656323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.613383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.602327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Herpes zoster","weight":0.591405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_zoster"},{"name":"Varicella zoster virus","weight":0.578148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_zoster_virus"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.575868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.514275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Chickenpox","weight":0.472605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox"},{"name":"Transient ischemic attack","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_ischemic_attack"},{"name":"Substance intoxication","weight":0.155747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.147108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tricyclic","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricyclic"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"}]}
