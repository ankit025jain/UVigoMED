{"id":9733,"title":"Sexual dimorphism, weight gain and glucose intolerance in a B- and T-cell deficient mouse model.","abstract":"Estrogen is thought to aid maintenance of insulin sensitivity potentially through modulation of a counter-regulatory mechanism that interferes with the contribution of adaptive and innate immune systems to visceral fat deposition. We evaluated the impact of estrogen on long-term high fat diet (HFD) intake in B- and T-cell deficient and immunocompetent animals comparatively.A total of 16 BALB and 16 SCID mice, 8 of each sex and strain, were randomized to receive low fat diet, 4.1% fat or HFD, 35% fat, such that there was a group of both each sex and each strain receiving each diet. Biweekly levels of adiponectin, leptin and insulin levels were assessed and a glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed after 13 weeks.Unlike their male counterparts, HFD-fed SCID females neither gained weight, nor became insulin resistant. Meanwhile, in the HFD-fed BALB groups both males and females gained weight similarly, but remarkable sexual dimorphism was nonetheless observed. The females had notable higher adiponectin levels as compared to males (10-60 ?g/mL vs. 6-10 ?g/mL respectively) causing the adiponectin-to-leptin (A/L) ratio to reach 80 one week after HFD initiation. The A/L dropped to 10, still higher than males, by week 13, but dropped to 2 by the end of the study in agreement with inverse insulin trends. None of the HFD-fed female groups developed insulin resistance (IR) by week 13, while all male counterparts had. Similar results were observed in the HFD-fed SCID groups whereby the females did not develop IR and had a higher A/L; however, adiponectin levels were comparable between groups (5-11 ?g/mL).The present study provides lacking evidence indicating that estrogen may be sufficient to prevent weight gain and development of glucose intolerance in high-fat fed B- and T-cell deficient mice.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Animal
