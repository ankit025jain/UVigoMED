{"id":76527,"title":"Endogenous glucose production from infancy to adulthood: a non-linear regression model.","abstract":"To construct a regression model for endogenous glucose production (EGP) as a function of age, and compare this with glucose supplementation using commonly used dextrose-based saline solutions at fluid maintenance rate in children.A model was constructed based on EGP data, as quantified by [6,6-(2)H2] glucose dilution after fasting overnight during normoglycaemia, in 40 healthy subjects aged 2.5-54.3 years old. The data were analysed using non-linear regression modelling with a 1-phase exponential decay curve fit. This model was compared to the amount of glucose provided with 2.5% or 5% dextrose-based saline solutions infused at fluid maintenance rate.Non-linear regression analysis of the EGP data yielded the following regression model: EGP (mg/kg/min)?=?6.50?×?2.72(-0.145?×?age (y))+1.93. Glucose supplementation at fluid maintenance rate with a 5% dextrose-based saline solution ranged from 46% at age 1?year to 55% at age 18?years of the glucose required to preclude the need for EGP. With a 2.5% dextrose-based solution, these percentages are 23% at age 1?year to 27% at age 18?years.we present an accurate non-linear regression model for EGP as a function of age. With standard dextrose-based saline solutions infused at fluid maintenance rate, only approximately 50% or less of EGP is provided. With prolonged infusion of these solutions, the deficit between exogenous glucose supplementation and EGP may induce a catabolic state and may ultimately lead to hypoglycaemia, especially in younger children.","date":"2014-11-14","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24996789","annotations":[{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.79917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Exponential decay","weight":0.634484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.503229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.440323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.398818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.355374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.301708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.177741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.1621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Nonlinear system","weight":0.155832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"},{"name":"Nonlinear regression","weight":0.148912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_regression"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.124353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.028099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Salinity","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"502","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/502"},{"name":"720","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Exponential growth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Outline of industrial organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_industrial_organization"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"}]}
