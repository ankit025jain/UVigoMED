{"id":44094,"title":"Colorectal cancer: serrated polyposis--should we screen first-degree relatives?","abstract":"Serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) is a condition characterized by multiple and/or proximal serrated polyps in the colorectum. Several features of SPS suggest there is an underlying genetic disorder that is yet to be identified. A new study provides insights on the diagnostic yield of screening colonoscopy in first-degree relatives of patients with SPS.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751913","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.894125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.789684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.701987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.689941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.607942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.602814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.533261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.219296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Polyposis","weight":0.111259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyposis"},{"name":"Social Democratic Party of Switzerland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"}]}
