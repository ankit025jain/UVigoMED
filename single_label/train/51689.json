{"id":51689,"title":"Role of RASSF1A promoter methylation in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The aim of the current meta-analysis was to comprehensively assess the role of RASSF1A promoter methylation in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.A range of electronic databases were searched: Web of Science (1945-2013), the Cochrane Library Database (Issue 12, 2013), PubMed (1966-2013), EMBASE (1980-2013), CINAHL (1982-2013), and the Chinese Biomedical Database (1982-2013) without language restrictions. Meta-analysis was conducted using the STATA 12.0 software. The crude odds ratio (OR) with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated.Twelve clinical cohort studies with a total of 739 ovarian cancer patients were included in the current meta-analysis. The results of our meta-analysis suggested that the frequency of RASSF1A promoter methylation in cancer tissues was higher compared with benign, adjacent, and normal tissues (cancer tissues vs. benign tissues: OR=9.92, 95% CI: 7.67-12.82, p<0.001; cancer tissues vs. adjacent tissues: OR=68.15, 95% CI: 39.30-118.18, p<0.001; cancer tissues vs. normal tissues: OR=30.71, 95% CI: 23.12-40.80, p<0.001; respectively). Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity and sample types revealed that RASSF1A gene methylation was closely associated with the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer in all subgroups (all p<0.05).Our findings indicated that abnormal RASSF1A promoter methylation may be strongly correlated with the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24665911","annotations":[{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.846532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.669715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.545375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.384824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.38297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.238135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Web of Science","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Science"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.0487277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Stata","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0276285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Bibliographic database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliographic_database"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
