{"id":88403,"title":"Implementation of a nationwide trauma network for the care of severely injured patients.","abstract":"Regional differences in the care of severely injured patients remain problematic in industrial countries.In 2006, the German Society for Trauma Surgery initiated the foundation of regional networks between trauma centers in a TraumaNetwork (TNW). The TNW consisted of five major elements as follows: (a) a whitebook on the treatment of severely injured patients; (b) evidence-based guidelines (S3); (c) local audits; (d) contracts of interhospital cooperation among all participating hospitals; and (e) TraumaRegister documentation. TNW hospitals are classified according to local audit results as supraregional (STC), regional (RTC), or local (LTC) trauma centers by criteria concerning staff, equipment, admission capacity, and responsibility.Five hundred four German trauma centers (TCs) were certified by the end of December 2012. By then, 37 regional TNWs, with a mean of 13.6 TCs, were established, covering approximately 80% of the country's territory. Of the hospitals, 92 were acknowledged as STCs, 210 as RTCs, and 202 as LTCs.In 2012, 19,124 patients were documented by the certified TCs. Fifty-seven percent of the patients were treated in STCs, 34% in RTCs, and 9% in LTCs. The mean (SD) Injury Severity Score (ISS) was highest in STCs (21 [13]), compared with 18 (12) in RTCs and 16 (10) in LTCs. There were differences in expected mortality (based on Revised Injury Severity Classification) according to the differences in the severity of trauma among the different categories, but in all types, the expected mortality was significantly higher than the observed mortality (differences in STCs, 1.8%; RTCs, 1.4%; LTCs, 2.0%).According to our findings, it is possible to successfully structure and standardize the care of severely injured patients in a nationwide trauma system. Better outcomes than expected were observed in all categories of TNW hospitals.Epidemiologic study, level III. Therapeutic/care management study, level IV.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854315","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.496419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.444313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.356117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.341581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.287909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.23563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.218084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.187896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.175832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"International Space Station","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Injury Severity Score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_Severity_Score"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Lieutenant Colonel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Real-time clock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock"},{"name":"Foundation (non-profit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(non-profit)"},{"name":"Advanced Trauma Life Support","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Trauma_Life_Support"},{"name":"Certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification"},{"name":"Supplemental Type Certificate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Type_Certificate"},{"name":"Regional differences and dialects in Indian English","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_differences_and_dialects_in_Indian_English"},{"name":"Territory (country subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(country_subdivision)"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"}]}
