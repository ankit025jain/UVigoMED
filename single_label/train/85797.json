{"id":85797,"title":"Component resolved diagnosis (CRD): how much is it presently used by Italian allergists?","abstract":"Component resolved diagnosis (CRD) represents an innovative and revolutionary tool in allergy diagnosis. At the same time, some criticisms can be outlined. The present web survey aimed at investigating the role of CRD in daily clinical practice, according to a sample of Italian specialists who manage allergic patients. 127 physicians, mostly allergists, completed the questionnaire, mainly coming from North and Center of Italy. Most of them (80%) were allergists. One physician out of three regularly takes into consideration CRD, that is currently available about in a half of the hospitals where the specialists work. CRD is mostly prescribed in the diagnostic work-up of suspected food allergy, as it can drive risk assessment, epinephrine prescription and dietary advice. Concerning respiratory allergy, CRD is considered useful in investigating cross-reactivity and in defining the best treatment option, even if only 32% of patients treated with immunotherapy had been previously studied with CRD. The present survey points out the need for the specialists to develop a more practical know-how about CRD. Its diagnostic accuracy and its real impact on the clinical management need to be better defined. The lacking of CRD technology in many hospitals limits the possibility for many allergists to directly experience molecular diagnosis.
