{"id":37929,"title":"Effect of early long-pulse pulsed dye laser treatment in infantile hemangiomas.","abstract":"Despite several recent reports on the efficacy of long-pulse pulsed dye laser (LP-PDL) in treating infantile hemangiomas, controversy remains.To determine the beneficial effects of early therapeutic intervention with LP-PDL in superficial and mixed hemangiomas.Clinical data from 40 children with 47 hemangiomas in preproliferative or proliferative phase treated with LP-PDL in a Korean tertiary hospital over 5 years were analyzed retrospectively. Treatments were repeated at 1- to 4-week intervals until growth stopped.Of the 47 hemangiomas, 32 were superficial, and 15 were mixed at presentation. Age was 9.6 ± 5.9 weeks at initiation of treatment and 18.0 ± 8.6 weeks at completion, and a positive linear correlation existed between the two. There were a mean of 4.6 ± 2.6 treatments per hemangioma, which was lower in superficial than in mixed hemangiomas. Improvement in color was documented in 84.4% of superficial and 86.7% of mixed hemangiomas, and 75.0% of superficial and 66.7% of mixed shrank. Hyperpigmentation occurred in two superficial hemangiomas.Early intervention in hemangiomas using LP-PDL successfully prevents further growth and accelerates a transition to plateau or involution phase with minimal adverse events, achieving good cosmetic outcomes.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460784","annotations":[{"name":"Laser","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.468693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.172396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Involution (mathematics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Dye laser","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye_laser"},{"name":"Hyperpigmentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpigmentation"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Korean language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language"},{"name":"Maxima and minima","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima"},{"name":"Pulse (signal processing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(signal_processing)"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Laser surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_surgery"},{"name":"Early childhood intervention","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood_intervention"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Phase transition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
