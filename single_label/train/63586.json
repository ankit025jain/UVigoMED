{"id":63586,"title":"Contralateral intramammary silicone lymphadenitis in a patient with an intact standard dual-lumen breast implant in the opposite reconstructed breast.","abstract":"Silicone lymphadenopathy is a recognized complication of silicone gel implant rupture; the ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes are most commonly involved. We report imaging findings on a range of different imaging modalities and biopsy results in a case of biopsy-proven silicone lymphadenitis involving contralateral intramammary and axillary lymph nodes in a patient with an intact standard dual-lumen breast implant in the opposite reconstructed breast. This case demonstrates that in a patient with disrupted lymph drainage due to prior mastectomy and axillary node dissection for breast cancer treatment, silicone particles can migrate in a retrograde fashion via the ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes and reach not only the contralateral axilla but also the outer quadrants of the contralateral breast, even in the presence of an intact breast implant.
