{"id":11719,"title":"Mucin 1 and cytokines mRNA in endometrium of dairy cows with postpartum uterine disease or repeat breeding.","abstract":"Mucin (MUC) 1 is an inducible innate immune effector, an important component of defense against bacterial invasion, and is linked with infertility in humans. The objectives were to evaluate messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of MUC1 and cytokine genes in the endometrium of cows with various postpartum uterine inflammatory conditions or with a history of repeat breeding. Endometrial samples were collected from lactating dairy cows diagnosed with metritis (n = 4), endometritis (n = 4), subclinical endometritis (n = 4), or no uterine pathology (normal; n = 4). In addition, endometrial samples were collected from repeat breeder cows with (n = 4) or without (n = 4) subclinical endometritis, and unaffected cows (n = 4). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine mRNA abundances of MUC1, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, interleukin (IL) 1?, IL6, IL8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ?, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1, and IGF-binding protein (BP) 2. The mRNA expressions were significantly greater for cows with metritis and clinical endometritis compared with cows with no uterine inflammation, except for IL6. However, mRNA expressions for these target genes were not different for cows with subclinical endometritis, compared with cows without uterine inflammation, except for IL1? and TNF? mRNA (P < 0.01). All mRNA expressions were greater (P < 0.001) for repeat breeder cows with subclinical endometritis compared with normal cows. However, in repeat breeder cows without subclinical endometritis, only expressions of MUC1, IGF1, and IGF BP2 were greater compared with normal cows (P < 0.01). Based on functional protein networks, there were significant associations between these transcripts. In conclusion, endometrial expressions of MUC1 and cytokine genes differed among normal, fertile versus diseased, and subfertile dairy cows. Perhaps, these altered gene expressions contribute to endometrial insufficiency and consequently pregnancy wastage.
