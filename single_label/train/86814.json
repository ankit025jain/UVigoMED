{"id":86814,"title":"[Molecular genetic characterization of the Gissar virus (GSRV) (Bunyaviridae, Phlebovirus, Uukuniemi group) isolated from the ticks Argas reflexus Fabricius, 1794 (Argasidae) collected in dovecote in Tajikistan].","abstract":"The Gissar virus (GSRV) was originally isolated from the ticks Argas reflexus, Fabricius, 1794 collected in a dovecote of Gissar village in Tajikistan (38 degrees 40' N, 68 degrees 40' E). Using electron microscopy, GSRV was classified to Bunyaviridae without referring to genus due to the absence of the antigenic relation with known bunyaviruses. In the present paper genome of GSRV was sequenced (MiSeq, Illumina). Molecular genetics and phylogenetic analysis showed. GSRV has a high level of homology with the Grand Arbaud Virus (GAV) (94% for nucleocapsid protein, 87.5% for RdRp, and 82% for the envelope proteins GnGc) isolated from the ticks A. Reflexus in a dovecote in France. GSRV and GAV have a narrow ecological niche associated with the icks A. Reflexus and birds (predominantly Columbidae). According to the conducted study, GSRV is classified as the topotypic for Central Asia variant of GAV, Uukuniemi group, genuses of the Phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae) (ID GenBank KJ425423, KJ425424, KJ425425).","date":"2014-12-31","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25566592","annotations":[{"name":"Ecological niche","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche"},{"name":"Columbidae","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.807574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Molecular genetics","weight":0.741125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_genetics"},{"name":"Central Asia","weight":0.722455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.700925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.696282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.667473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.660403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.659662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.63101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.619436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cladistics","weight":0.590333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Tick","weight":0.46564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.450215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.427343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.376917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","weight":0.371893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"France","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Nucleocapsid","weight":0.271313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleocapsid"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.256577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Viral envelope","weight":0.0591548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_envelope"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Tajikistan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Bunyaviridae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyaviridae"},{"name":"Phlebovirus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlebovirus"},{"name":"Illumina (company)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina_(company)"},{"name":"GenBank","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GenBank"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Idaho","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho"},{"name":"Joule","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Johan Christian Fabricius","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Christian_Fabricius"}]}
