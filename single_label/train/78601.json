{"id":78601,"title":"[Clinical significance of acoustic rhinometry and nasal resistance checks in the efficacy evaluation of low temperature radiofrequency ablation by nasal endoscopy].","abstract":"To study on clinical significance of acoustic rhinometry and nasal resistance checks by low temperature radiofrequency ablation on nasal endoscopy operation.Application instrument of acoustic rhinometry and nasal resistance meter on 106 cases with moderate to severe persistent nasal obstruction symptoms. These patients are not obvious or invalid after regular drug treatment. The preoperative and postoperative six months, with the nasal mucosa contraction before and after by inspect respectively,also record nasal resistance (NR), nasal minimum cross-sectional area (NMCA), distance of the minimal cross-sectional area to the nostril (DCAN), mean nasal cross-sectional area (MNCA), nasal cavity from volume (NCV). The other 36 cases of healthy people as a control group. Before and after nasal mucosa contraction by inspect. Two sets of data were statistically analyzed with SAS6.12. The efficacy evaluation of radiofrequency ablation by improve the extent and visual analog scale (VAS) score, with the patient's subjective symptoms.The group of preoperative rhinitis treatment NR higher than the controls significantly, the NMCA significantly lower than the control group (P< 0.01). The group of postoperative by radiofrequency ablation and rhinitis treatment was 100%, postoperative VAS scores were decreased compared with pre operative (P < 0.01). The group of rhinitis treatment NR was significantly lower than the preoperative, and NMCA significantly increased compared with the preoperative (P < 0.01). Before and after nasal contraction in the same group, NR and NMCA was no difference (P > 0.05). The NR and NMCA of the postoperative in rhinitis treatment group was no difference compared with the control group (P > 0.05).Low temperature radio frequency ablation by nasal endoscopy operation had a significant improvement of nasal ventilation functions for patients with moderate to severe chronic rhinitis, acoustic rhinometry and nasal resistance can be an objective and accurate evaluation to this operation.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
