{"id":83597,"title":"Molecular cloning and expression analysis of the MTN gene during adventitious root development in IBA-induced tetraploid black locust.","abstract":"5'-Methylthioadenosine (MTA) nucleosidase (MTN) plays a key role in the methionine (Met) recycling pathway of plants. Here, we report the isolation of the 1158 bp full-length, cDNA sequence encoding tetraploid black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) MTN (TrbMTN), which contains an open reading frame of 810 bp that encodes a 269 amino acid protein. The amino acid sequence of TrbMTN has more than 88% sequence identity to the MTNs from other plants, with a closer phylogenetic relationship to MTNs from legumes than to MTNs from other plants. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that the TrbMTN gene localizes mainly to the cell membrane and cytoplasm of onion epidermal cells. Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)-treated cuttings showed higher TrbMTN transcript levels than untreated control cuttings during root primordium and adventitious root formation. TrbMTN and key Met cycle genes showed differential expression in shoots, leaves, stems, and roots, with the highest expression observed in stems. IBA-treated cuttings also showed higher TrbMTN activity than control cuttings during root primordium and adventitious root formation. These results indicate that TrbMTN gene might play an important role in the regulation of IBA-induced adventitious root development in tetraploid black locust cuttings.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25305345","annotations":[{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"Butyric acid","weight":0.875712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyric_acid"},{"name":"Molecular cloning","weight":0.857772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloning"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Polyploid","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Peptide sequence","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_sequence"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Sequence alignment","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Methionine","weight":0.751881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine"},{"name":"Indole","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indole"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.745763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Complementary DNA","weight":0.735901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_DNA"},{"name":"Legume","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume"},{"name":"Cutting (plant)","weight":0.707852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_(plant)"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.704806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.618277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.61722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Onion","weight":0.351701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.311358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Epidermis (botany)","weight":0.296137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(botany)"},{"name":"Reading frame","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_frame"},{"name":"Primordium","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordium"},{"name":"Locust","weight":0.255845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.205318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Adventitiousness","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventitiousness"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Biogeochemical cycle","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycle"},{"name":"Recycling","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling"}]}
