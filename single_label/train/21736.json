{"id":21736,"title":"Detection of natural killer T cells in mice infected with Rickettsia conorii.","abstract":"Little information is available regarding the role of natural killer T (NKT) cells during the early stage of Rickettsia conorii infection. Herein, C3H/HeN mice were infected with the Malish 7 strain of R. conorii. Splenocytes from these mice were analysed in the early stage of the infection by flow cytometry and compared with uninfected controls. Our results showed an increase in NKT cells in infected mice. Additionally, NKT interleukin (IL)-17(+) cells increased three days after infection, together with a concurrent decrease in the relative amount of NKT interferon (IFN)-?(+) cells. We also confirmed a higher amount of NK IFN-?(+) cells in infected mice. Taken together, our data showed that NKT cells producing Il-17 increased during the early stage of rickettsial infection. These results suggest a connection between IL-17(+) NKT cells and vasculitis, which is the main clinical symptom of rickettsiosis.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589105","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Rickettsia","weight":0.796792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickettsia"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.781887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.751881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.715421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.655041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Natural Killer T cell","weight":0.457844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Killer_T_cell"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.384301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.262548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.148516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Taken (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taken_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Rickettsiosis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickettsiosis"}]}
