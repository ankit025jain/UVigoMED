{"id":40942,"title":"Methods of emergency surgery in high-risk stigmata peptic ulcer hemorrhage.","abstract":"The choice of emergency operative methods in management of peptic ulcer hemorrhage (PUH) is controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze the patient characteristics, surgical methods and treatment outcome of patients with PUH during 10 years.Of the 953 admitted PUH patients all 67 (7.0%) operated cases had high-risk stigmata PUH (Forrest classification). These patients were grouped and their data were compared under two 5-year periods: period I - 32 patients (2003-2007) and period II - 35 patients (2008-2012).The majority of the patients had giant ulcer (diameter ? 2 cm) hemorrhage at 75.0% (24/32) and 94.3% (33/35) during study periods I and II, respectively (P=0.04). Giant duodenal and gastric ulcers for PUH were operated in 16 and 8 vs 27 and 6 during periods I and II, respectively. Ulcer exclusion or ulcerectomy combined with definitive acid reducing surgery was applied in 68.7% (22/32) and 71.4% (25/35) of the patients, respectively, without early recurrent hemorrhage. Postoperative in hospital mortality in the 10-year study period was 6.0% (4/67); 2.1% (1/48) of the patients died after definitive operations and 15.8% (3/19) (P=0.04) died after non-definitive operations.The surgical treatment of high-risk stigmata PUH was mainly associated with giant, particularly giant duodenal ulcer. As a rule, ulcer exclusion or ulcerectomy as hemorrhage control, combined with definitive surgery, was applied in the majority of the cases with an in hospital mortality of 2.1%.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24970305","annotations":[{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.52159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.143777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Sex reassignment surgery","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery"},{"name":"Stigmata","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmata"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"319","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/319"},{"name":"953","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/953"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
