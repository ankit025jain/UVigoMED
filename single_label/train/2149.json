{"id":2149,"title":"Patients' assessment of adalimumab self-injection for Crohn's disease: a multicenter questionnaire survey (The PEARL Survey).","abstract":"Adalimumab (ADA) is a self-injectable anti-tumor necrosis factor-? antibody used for treating Crohn’s disease (CD). Although self-injecting ADA may be convenient for patients, few reports have assessed patients receiving ADA self-injection therapy.We conducted a questionnaire survey involving outpatients on ADA self-injection therapy at four university hospitals. We analyzed the degree of satisfaction with and adherence to the self-injection therapy and performed sub-analyses.Responses were obtained from 124 patients. Before treatment initiation, 38% patients replied that they were unwilling to accept the self-injection therapy. However, after treatment initiation, 75% patients were satisfied with the treatment. 66 patients previously treated with infliximab (IFX), the degree of treatment satisfaction was significantly higher in patients who felt burdened to the time required for IFX infusion than in those who had not felt burdened (P < 0.05). Patient adherence to ADA was high (85%). Multivariate analysis regarding adherence revealed that duration of disease (OR, 0.99), degree of treatment efficacy satisfaction (OR, 13.42), and schedule registration (OR, 7.95) were significant. Safety assessment results were within the range of those already reported.ADA self-injection was thought to have good adherence and a safe administration method according to patients’ assessments.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25436358","annotations":[{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.916233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.469643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.422733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Infliximab","weight":0.407951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infliximab"},{"name":"Adalimumab","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalimumab"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"University","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Interactive Financial Exchange","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Financial_Exchange"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Pearl (disambiguation)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_(disambiguation)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"American Diabetes Association","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Diabetes_Association"}]}
