{"id":72813,"title":"Identification of 2R-ohnologue gene families displaying the same mutation-load skew in multiple cancers.","abstract":"The complexity of signalling pathways was boosted at the origin of the vertebrates, when two rounds of whole genome duplication (2R-WGD) occurred. Those genes and proteins that have survived from the 2R-WGD—termed 2R-ohnologues—belong to families of two to four members, and are enriched in signalling components relevant to cancer. Here, we find that while only approximately 30% of human transcript-coding genes are 2R-ohnologues, they carry 42–60% of the gene mutations in 30 different cancer types. Across a subset of cancer datasets, including melanoma, breast, lung adenocarcinoma, liver and medulloblastoma, we identified 673 2R-ohnologue families in which one gene carries mutations at multiple positions, while sister genes in the same family are relatively mutation free. Strikingly, in 315 of the 322 2R-ohnologue families displaying such a skew in multiple cancers, the same gene carries the heaviest mutation load in each cancer, and usually the second-ranked gene is also the same in each cancer. Our findings inspire the hypothesis that in certain cancers, heterogeneous combinations of genetic changes impair parts of the 2R-WGD signalling networks and force information flow through a limited set of oncogenic pathways in which specific non-mutated 2R-ohnologues serve as effectors. The non-mutated 2R-ohnologues are therefore potential therapeutic targets. These include proteins linked to growth factor signalling, neurotransmission and ion channels.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24941500","annotations":[{"name":"Medulloblastoma","weight":0.941928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulloblastoma"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.859169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Vertebrate","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.744624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.732642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Neurotransmission","weight":0.709788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmission"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Gene family","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_family"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.672261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.664934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Polyploid","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Gene duplication","weight":0.604945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplication"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Central dogma of molecular biology","weight":0.204301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.154334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.141231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic load","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_load"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"},{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"}]}
