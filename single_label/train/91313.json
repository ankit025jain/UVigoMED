{"id":91313,"title":"Ocular trauma scores in paediatric open globe injuries.","abstract":"To assess the predictive value and the applicability of Ocular Trauma Score (OTS) for paediatric injuries.Retrospective case series of 71 open globe injuries in children less than 18 years of age with a minimum follow-up period of 1 year. The variables of the OTS, the Paediatric Penetrating OTS (POTS), lens injuries and anterior versus posterior segment injuries were analysed for their predictive values in terms of visual outcome. The applicability and the predictive values of OTS and POTS as a whole were then evaluated.Initial visual acuities, retinal detachments, wound locations (p<0.001 each), lens injuries (p=0.001), posterior segment injuries (p=0.002), traumatic cataracts (p=0.010), hyphaema (p=0.011) and vitreous haemorrhages (p=0.026) had significant impacts on visual outcome. The application of OTS proved difficult, as the presence of a mild degree of a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) could not accurately be evaluated in all of our patients. Calculating the OTS without evaluation of RAPD renders it easily applicable for the initial examinations while remaining significantly prognostic (p<0.001). The predictions of the POTS correlated with the actual final visual acuities (p<0.001), but several POTS variables (ie, iris prolapse, age, organic injuries and delay of surgery >48 h) had only limited impacts on visual outcome.The OTS has a high predictive value for visual outcome after open globe injuries in children, even without evaluation of RAPD.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518079","annotations":[{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.789621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.744059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Hyphema","weight":0.684737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphema"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Posterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.590704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.534815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.528959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Marcus Gunn pupil","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Gunn_pupil"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.126214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Plain old telephone service","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service"},{"name":"RAPD","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAPD"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Afferent nerve fiber","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afferent_nerve_fiber"},{"name":"Earth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Detachment (military)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment_(military)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"}]}
