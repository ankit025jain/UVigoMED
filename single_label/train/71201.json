{"id":71201,"title":"[Protective effects of total epimedium flavonoids against QA-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells].","abstract":"To investigate the protective effects and its mechanisms of total epimedium flavonoids (TEF) against Quindinince acid (QA)-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.The MT assay was used to detect the toxicity of QA and the cell viability of pretreatment of TEF and co-incubation with QA in SH-SY5Y cells; Cell apoptosis was observed by Hochest33258 staining; SOD and GSH-Px activities as well as MDA content were measured by colorimetric method; The mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi m) and intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were monitored by FCM.TEF increased the cell viability of SH-SY5Y cells, reduced apoptosis cells significantly, improved SOD and GSH-Px activities, decreased MDA content, increased the mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced intracellular free calcium concentration( [Ca2+]i ).TEF has significant protective effects against QA-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells,the action mechanism may be associated with resisting oxidative stress, decreasing the [Ca2]i and up-regulating delta psi m.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090685","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.836841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.789684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.750663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.737935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.67362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.660458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.531033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.352291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Colorimetry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetry"},{"name":"3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine"},{"name":"Epimedium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimedium"},{"name":"Pounds per square inch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Montana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"River delta","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta"}]}
