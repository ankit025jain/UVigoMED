{"id":76722,"title":"Pancreatic ?-cell-specific ablation of TASK-1 channels augments glucose-stimulated calcium entry and insulin secretion, improving glucose tolerance.","abstract":"Calcium entry through voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (VDCCs) is required for pancreatic ?-cell insulin secretion. The 2-pore-domain acid-sensitive potassium channel (TASK-1) regulates neuronal excitability and VDCC activation by hyperpolarizing the plasma membrane potential (??p); however, a role for pancreatic ?-cell TASK-1 channels is unknown. Here we examined the influence of TASK-1 channel activity on the ?-cell ??p and insulin secretion during secretagogue stimulation. TASK-1 channels were found to be highly expressed in human and rodent islets and localized to the plasma membrane of ?-cells. TASK-1-like currents of mouse and human ?-cells were blocked by the potent TASK-1 channel inhibitor, A1899 (250nM). Although inhibition of TASK-1 currents did not influence the ?-cell ??p in the presence of low (2mM) glucose, A1899 significantly enhanced glucose-stimulated (14mM) ??p depolarization of human and mouse ?-cells. TASK-1 inhibition also resulted in greater secretagogue-stimulated Ca(2+) influx in both human and mouse islets. Moreover, conditional ablation of mouse ?-cell TASK-1 channels reduced K2P currents, increased glucose-stimulated ??p depolarization, and augmented secretagogue-stimulated Ca(2+) influx. The ??p depolarization caused by TASK-1 inhibition resulted in a transient increase in glucose-stimulated mouse ?-cell action potential (AP) firing frequency. However, secretagogue-stimulated ?-cell AP duration eventually increased in the presence of A1899 as well as in ?-cells without TASK-1, causing a decrease in AP firing frequency. Ablation or inhibition of mouse ?-cell TASK-1 channels also significantly enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which improved glucose tolerance. Conversely, TASK-1 ablation did not perturb ?-cell ??p, Ca(2+) influx, or insulin secretion under low-glucose conditions (2mM). These results reveal a glucose-dependent role for ?-cell TASK-1 channels of limiting glucose-stimulated ??p depolarization and insulin secretion, which modulates glucose homeostasis.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24932805","annotations":[{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.832852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Depolarization","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depolarization"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Voltage-dependent calcium channel","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-dependent_calcium_channel"},{"name":"Hyperpolarization (biology)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpolarization_(biology)"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Potassium channel","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_channel"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.709087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.687788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.607118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.413179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.37695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.375426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.329404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Kelvin","weight":0.309423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.297256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Tandem pore domain potassium channel","weight":0.278737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_pore_domain_potassium_channel"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0907784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.042255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"List of distinct cell types in the adult human body","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Excited state","weight":0.0199414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"}]}
