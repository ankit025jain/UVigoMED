{"id":68038,"title":"[Two cases of epithelioid angiomyolipoma of the kidney].","abstract":"Two cases of epithelioid angiomyolipoma of the kidney are reported. A 62-year-old female with incidental left renal tumor underwent laparoscopic leftpartial nephrectomy under a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. A pathological examination revealed epithelioid angiomyolipoma. The second case was that of a 35-year-old female with back pain. A laparoscopic right nephrectomy revealed epithelioid angiomyolipoma. This recently identified variant of angiomyolipoma is sometimes associated with aggressive clinical behavior including local recurrence and metastasis.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564079","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.717586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.714481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.240041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Renal vein","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_vein"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Angiomyolipoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiomyolipoma"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
