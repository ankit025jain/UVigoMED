{"id":78056,"title":"[RAGE, NF-kappaB, p21 expressions in mouse spiral ganglion cells].","abstract":"To research advanced glycation end-product receptors (RAGE), NF-kappaB, p21 expressions in C57BL/6j mice cochlea spiral ganglion cells(SGC) ,and then to investigate the presbycusis pathogenesis.To take C57BL/6J mice:2 month 25,and 10 month 25. Histological sections were observed the SGC. RAGE, NF-kappaB, p21 were immunohistochemical in the SGC,with IPP6 to IOD.(1) The count SGCs of 10 month-old was obviously decreased comparing to 2 month-old, the count of 2 month SGC is 39 +/- 5, 10 month group is 20 +/- 6, P < 0.01; (2) RAGE, NF-kappaB, p21 expressed in spiral ganglion cell,different place with different age,and the means optical density in the 10 month are higher than the 2 month, respectively. The IOD of RAGE expression in 2 month SGC: 0.179 +/- 0.025, 10 month IOD: 0.308 +/- 0.050; The IOD of NF-kappaB expression in 2 month SGC: 0.181 +/- 0.045, 10 month IOD: 0.335 +/- 0.120; The IOD of p21 expression in 2 month SGC: 0.160 +/- 0.023, 10 month IOD: 0.365 +/- 0.031, compare with 2 group, respectively, P < 0.05, and the difference has statistics sense.RAGE,NF-kappaB, p21 expressions are in SGCs and increases with the aging of SGCs, suppose RAGE, NF-kappaB, p21 may participate in the process of presbycusis pathogenesis.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800547","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cochlea","weight":0.802289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Ganglion cell","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cell"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.568446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.396728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.320678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.295016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.121805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Presbycusis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbycusis"},{"name":"Spiral ganglion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_ganglion"},{"name":"6-j symbol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-j_symbol"},{"name":"NFkappaB","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFkappaB"},{"name":"Absorbance","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Joule","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule"},{"name":"308","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/308"},{"name":"335","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/335"},{"name":"Helix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Facial expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_expression"},{"name":"Institute of Directors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Directors"},{"name":"Count Dracula","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Dracula"},{"name":"Toyota C transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_C_transmission"},{"name":"Codex Athous Dionysiou","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Athous_Dionysiou"},{"name":"Stargate Command","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Command"},{"name":"P21","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P21"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"}]}
