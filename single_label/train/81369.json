{"id":81369,"title":"Interdisciplinary orthodontics: a case report.","abstract":"Replacement of the impacted maxillary canines with implants is a great challenge for all dentists. Adequate implant space, sufficient space between the roots, alveolar bone bed, thin labialgingiva and the guiding role of canine in a mutually protected occlusion make the choice of implant position with proper diameter more difficult. In this article we present a patient whose upper canines were replaced with implants after surgical removal of impacted teeth. There was inadequate space for prosthetic crown over implant fixtures.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25109057","annotations":[{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.826718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.686433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Canine tooth","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.449333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.442418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.341771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Bone bed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_bed"},{"name":"Tooth impaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_impaction"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.0251131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
