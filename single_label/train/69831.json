{"id":69831,"title":"[Experience with virtual sonography of the breast].","abstract":"To assess the capabilities of and the first experience with an ACUSON S2000 automated breast volume scanner (ABVS) (Siemens, Germany) to detect abnormal breast lumps.Examinations were made in 97 patients who underwent radiological studies encompassing digital mammography, B-mode ultrasonography of the breast, and its pathomorphological examination. All the cases were classified according to the BI-RADS system. Abnormal breast lumps (BI-RADS 1) were not found in 27 cases; clearly defined benign masses (BI-RADS 2) were detected in 18, and pathomorphologically verified breast cancer (BC) (BI-RADS 5) in 29 cases. All the patients also underwent breast ultrasonography using an ACUSON S2000 system (Siemens, Germany). The results of ABVS examination were compared with those of standard comprehensive breast radiologic examination. Having no preliminary additional information on each patient, an independent expert--a radiologic diagnostician appraised all ultrasound scanning data at a special review station.The sensitivity of the automated scanning assay in detecting breast abnormalities was 100%; its specificity and diagnostic accuracy were 40 and 88%, respectively. The independent expert established the diagnosis of BC in 26 (90%) of the 29 cases. According to the results of automated breast scanning, pre-examination using a set of radiation methods was recommended in 66 (66%) cases. The hyperdiagnosis was 24%.Taking into consideration the fact that none of the BC case was overlooked, the first experience with ABVS showed encouraging results and the need for further clinical tests of the automated breast scanning system.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25276885","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Digital mammography","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mammography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.74293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.44001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.42438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Breast lump","weight":0.415878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_lump"},{"name":"Siemens","weight":0.373306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.303648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.250999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Digital photography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_photography"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
