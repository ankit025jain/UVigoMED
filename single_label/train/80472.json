{"id":80472,"title":"Effectiveness of antenatal clinics to deliver intermittent preventive treatment and insecticide treated nets for the control of malaria in pregnancy in Mali: a household survey.","abstract":"WHO recommends intermittent-preventive-treatment (IPTp) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and insecticide-treated-nets (ITNs) to prevent malaria in pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa, however uptake remains unacceptably low. We evaluated the effectiveness of antenatal clinics (ANC) to deliver two doses of IPTp and ITNs to pregnant women in Segou district, Mali.We used household data to assess the systems effectiveness of ANC to deliver IPTp and ITNs to pregnant women and used logistic regression to identify predictors of ANC attendance, receipt of IPTp and ITN use during pregnancy, and the impact on community effectiveness.Of 81% of recently pregnant women who made at least one ANC visit, 59% of these attended during the eligible gestational age for IPTp. Of these, 82% reported receiving one dose of SP and 91% attended ANC again, of whom 66% received a second dose, resulting in a cumulative effectiveness for 2-dose IPTp of 29%, most of whom used an ITN (90%). Cumulative effectiveness of 2-dose SP by directly observed therapy (DOT) was very low (6%). ITN use was 92%, and ANC was the main source (81%). Reported and ANC-card data showed some doses of SP are given to women in their first trimester. Women were less likely to receive two doses by DOT if they were married (OR 0.10; CI 0.03, 0.40), or lived <5 km from the health facility (OR 0.34; CI 0.14, 0.83). A high household person-LLIN ratio predicted low ITN use in pregnant women (OR 0.16; CI 0.04, 0.55).Our findings suggest poor adherence by health workers to provision of IPTp by eligible gestational age and DOT, contributing to low effectiveness of this strategy in this setting. ITN delivery and use among women was substantially higher. Efforts to improve health worker adherence to IPTp guidelines are needed to improve service delivery of IPTp.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651078","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.866004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Insecticide","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.568442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.476526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Mali","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.386431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Prenatal care","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Health Human Resources","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Human_Resources"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"},{"name":"Kilometre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"African National Congress","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress"},{"name":"ITN","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITN"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Directly observed therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directly_observed_therapy"},{"name":"Bamana Empire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamana_Empire"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Mosquito net","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net"},{"name":"Stream","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Direct imaging","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_imaging"},{"name":"Social Democratic Party of Switzerland","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Receipt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receipt"}]}
