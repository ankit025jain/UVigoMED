{"id":79089,"title":"Laryngeal muscle activity in unilateral vocal fold paralysis patients using electromyography and coronal reconstructed images.","abstract":"To assess laryngeal muscle activity in unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) patients using laryngeal electromyography (LEMG) and coronal images.Case series with chart review.University hospital.Twenty-one patients diagnosed with UVFP of at least 6 months in duration with paralytic dysphonia, underwent LEMG, phonatory function tests, and coronal imaging. A 4-point scale was used to grade motor unit (MU) recruitment: absent = 4+, greatly decreased = 3+, moderately decreased = 2+, and mildly decreased = 1+. Maximum phonation time (MPT) and mean flow rate (MFR) were employed. Coronal images were assessed for differences in thickness and vertical position of the vocal folds during phonation and inhalation.MU recruitment in thyroarytenoid/lateral cricoarytenoid (TA/LCA) muscle complex results were 1+ for 4 patients, 2+ for 5, 3+ for 6, and 4+ for 6. MPT was positively correlated with MU recruitment. Thinning of the affected fold was evident during phonation in 19 of the 21 subjects. The affected fold was at an equal level with the healthy fold in all 9 subjects with MU recruitment of 1+ and 2+. Eleven of 12 subjects with MU recruitments of 3+ and 4+ showed the affected fold at a higher level than the healthy fold. There was a significant difference between MU recruitment and the vertical position of the affected fold.Synkinetic reinnervation may occur in some cases with UVFP. MU recruitments of TA/LCA muscle complex in UVFP patients may be related to phonatory function and the vertical position of the affected fold.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24493787","annotations":[{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.583969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.485983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.390416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Phonation","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.0408123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Motor unit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_unit"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Dysphonia","weight":0.0254508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphonia"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Mean flow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_flow"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Thinning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinning"},{"name":"Scale (map)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map)"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Cricoarytenoid muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricoarytenoid_muscle"},{"name":"Earth Party","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Party"},{"name":"Linguistic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Reinnervation","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinnervation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"Coronal plane","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_plane"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 4","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_4"},{"name":"Orders, decorations, and medals of Nigeria","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders,_decorations,_and_medals_of_Nigeria"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
