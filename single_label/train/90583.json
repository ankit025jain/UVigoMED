{"id":90583,"title":"An evidence-based review of the use of a combat gauze (QuikClot) for hemorrhage control.","abstract":"Trauma is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Uncontrolled hemorrhage related to the traumatic event is often the major cause of complications and death. The use of hemostatic agents may be one of the easiest and most effective methods of treating hemorrhage. The US military recommends a hemostatic combat gauze (QuikClot Combat Gauze) as the first-line hemostatic agent for use in treatment of severe hemorrhage. This review provides essential information for evidence-based use of this agent. The PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) question guiding this search for evidence was: Is QuikClot Combat Gauze, a hemostatic agent, effective and safe in controlling hemorrhage in trauma patients in the prehospital setting? The evidence appraised was a combination of lower-level human and animal research. It did not conclusively demonstrate that this combat gauze is an effective hemostatic agent for use in trauma patients, but the results are promising in supporting its use. The evidence does not describe serious side effects, exothermic reaction, and thromboemboli formation associated with other hemostatic agents. Further investigation to determine the effectiveness of hemostatic agents, specifically QuikClot Combat Gauze, in the management of trauma casualties in the prehospital setting is required. These should include large-scale, multicenter, prehospital randomized controlled trials.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597007","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.775768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.761977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.74922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.727042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.667606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.557294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.541196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.436161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.301363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"United States Armed Forces","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Combat","weight":0.11317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Antihemorrhagic","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihemorrhagic"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Exothermic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic"},{"name":"Exothermic reaction","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic_reaction"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Casualty (person)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_(person)"},{"name":"Gauze","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauze"}]}
