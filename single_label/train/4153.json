{"id":4153,"title":"Management of the gastrointestinal tract and nutrition in the geriatric surgical patient.","abstract":"Aging is associated with physiological changes in the gut and with physical and psychosocial risk factors that predispose to malnutrition, particularly in the presence of disease states. The geriatric faction of the surgical population is increasing, and malnourished, critically ill geriatric surgical patients have worse outcomes.
