{"id":42718,"title":"Downregulation of WIF-1 and Wnt5a in patients with colorectal carcinoma: clinical significance.","abstract":"Activation of the wingless-type (Wnt) signaling pathway is common in various human cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC). Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1) is a secreted antagonist that can bind Wnt ligands and therefore inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway. In this study, we aimed to analyze the expression of two members of Wnt signaling (WIF-1 and Wnt5a) in Tunisian patients with sporadic CRC. WIF-1 was frequently methylated in tumor tissues (87.95 %) compared to normal mucosa (39.54 %) and correlated with distant metastasis and vascular invasion (P?=?0.001 and 0.037, respectively). The unmethylated profile of the WIF-1 promoter conferred a benefit to patients in terms of overall survival (P log rank?=?0.024). In addition, in the group of patients with methylated WIF-1 promoter, the overall survival rate was significantly prolonged for those with small tumor size (<5 cm) and absence of distant metastasis (P log rank?=?0.007 and 0.036, respectively). Aberrant CpG methylation of the WIF-1 promoter leads to transcriptional silencing of this tumor suppressor gene in tumor tissues (P?=?0.001). Furthermore, we showed that the level of Wnt5a mRNA was significantly lower in tumor compared to normal tissues (P?=?0.031) and lower still in those showing more aggressive behavior (presence of lymph nodes and advanced TNM stage). Our finding supports that WIF-1 is frequently methylated and that Wnt5a acts as a tumor suppressor gene in CRC. Loss of WIF-1 and Wnt5a functions results in more aggressive behavior of the disease.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24833087","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Wnt signaling pathway","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.758148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.740695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.732188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.695321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.679772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.646686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.623117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.554257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.303234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.073608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Epistasis","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis"},{"name":"CpG site","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
