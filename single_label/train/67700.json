{"id":67700,"title":"Calreticulin activates ?1 integrin via fucosylation by fucosyltransferase 1 in J82 human bladder cancer cells.","abstract":"Fucosylation regulates various pathological events in cells. We reported that different levels of CRT (calreticulin) affect the cell adhesion and metastasis of bladder cancer. However, the precise mechanism of tumour metastasis regulated by CRT remains unclear. Using a DNA array, we identified FUT1 (fucosyltransferase 1) as a gene regulated by CRT expression levels. CRT regulated cell adhesion through ?1,2-linked fucosylation of ?1 integrin and this modification was catalysed by FUT1. To clarify the roles for FUT1Â in bladder cancer, we transfected the human FUT1 gene into CRT-RNAi stable cell lines. FUT1 overexpression in CRT-RNAi cells resulted in increased levels of ?1 integrin fucosylation and rescued cell adhesion to type-I collagen. Treatment with UEA-1 (Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1), a lectin that recognizes FUT1-modified glycosylation structures, did not affect cell adhesion. In contrast, a FUT1-specific fucosidase diminished the activation of ?1 integrin. These results indicated that ?1,2-fucosylation of ?1 integrin was not involved in integrin-collagen interaction, but promoted ?1 integrin activation. Moreover, we demonstrated that CRT regulated FUT1 mRNA degradation at the 3'-UTR. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that CRT stabilized FUT1 mRNA, thereby leading to an increase in fucosylation of ?1 integrin. Furthermore, increased fucosylation levels activate ?1 integrin, rather than directly modifying the integrin-binding sites.
