{"id":62393,"title":"Assessment of the outcomes associated with periprocedural anticoagulation management in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","abstract":"To report the outcomes of an institutional protocol for periprocedural anticoagulant (AC) management in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).Children being treated for ALL who received full-dose (therapeutic) anticoagulation before undergoing at least 1 lumbar puncture (LP) were included in this retrospective cohort study. The main outcome was the risk of traumatic LP; exploratory analysis included the risks of symptomatic spinal hematoma and progression/recurrence of the thrombotic event. Analyses were conducted using logistic regression analysis with a generalized estimating equation approach.Twenty-two children with ALL receiving an AC underwent a total of 396 LPs. Although traumatic LP was associated with full-dose AC therapy in univariable analysis, a multiple logistic regression model controlling for other risk factors for traumatic LP showed that AC therapy was not significantly associated with the risk of traumatic LP when the ACs were held as per the institutional protocol. No patient developed symptomatic spinal hematoma. Exploratory analysis revealed that AC dose, a likely marker of thrombus burden, was significantly associated with progression/recurrence of the thrombotic event in univariable analysis.In our cohort, recent AC therapy was not statistically associated with an increased risk of bleeding after LP when following a specific protocol for periprocedural AC management. The risk associated with the progression/recurrence of thromboembolic events requires further evaluation.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582006","annotations":[{"name":"Lumbar puncture","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_puncture"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.6485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.581261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.458832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.430486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.417227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.383986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.358436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.315191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.301994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.227671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Exploratory data analysis","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.122908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.1216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Generalized estimating equation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_estimating_equation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Logistic distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_distribution"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
