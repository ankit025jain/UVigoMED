{"id":52114,"title":"Effect of vildagliptin add-on treatment to metformin on plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.","abstract":"A close association has been demonstrated between increased cardiovascular risk and high asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. We planned to measure serum ADMA levels in type 2 DM patients using vildagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.A total of 68 type 2 DM patients who were on metformin were enrolled in the study. Based on the glycemic levels of patients, vildagliptin was added on to treatment in 33 patients. Patients were followed for 6 months. Serum ADMA, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen levels were compared in groups of patients using metformin or metformin + vildagliptin, after 6 months.Serum ADMA levels were found to be significantly lower in the group using vildagliptin compared to the group using metformin + vildagliptin (P<0.001). However, serum C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels were statistically similar in the two study groups (P=0.34 and P=0.23, respectively).Metformin + vildagliptin treatment was observed to lower serum ADMA levels in type 2 DM patients. Our findings notwithstanding, large-scale prospective randomized controlled studies are warranted to conclude that vildagliptin provides cardiovascular protection along with diabetes regulation.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627624","annotations":[{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Asymmetric dimethylarginine","weight":0.792105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_dimethylarginine"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.776157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor","weight":0.751278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.27928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Vildagliptin","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vildagliptin"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"}]}
