{"id":63329,"title":"[Successful treatment with azacitidine for a patient with relapsed myelodysplastic syndrome after cord blood transplantation].","abstract":"A 72-year-old man visited our hospital in July 2009 with a major complaint of lightheadedness. Based on bone marrow aspiration, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), refractory anemia with excessive blast-2 was diagnosed. Complete remission (CR) was achieved after low-dose cytarabine and aclarubicin therapy. After two courses of low-dose cytarabine therapy, at the first CR, cord blood transplantation (CBT) was performed after reduced-intensity conditioning in January 2010. However, recurrence was found in September 2011. Azacitidine (AZA) was administered subcutaneously daily for either 7 or 5 days and repeated every 4 weeks at doses of 100 mg/day. During nine cycles of AZA treatment, no graft-versus-host disease was observed and no transfusions of red cells/platelet concentrate were required. As of 1 year after the relapse was detected, the patient remains alive with stable disease. As there are few reports on AZA treatment for patients with MDS who experience relapse after CBT, the efficacy of this approach remains unclear. Further clinical trials including dose, duration, and number of cycles of AZA for MDS patients who relapse after transplantation are required.
