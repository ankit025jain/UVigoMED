{"id":19880,"title":"Total hip replacement in HIV-positive patients.","abstract":"We report the short-term follow-up, functional outcome and incidence of early and late infection after total hip replacement (THR) in a group of HIV-positive patients who do not suffer from haemophilia or have a history of intravenous drug use. A total of 29 patients underwent 43 THRs, with a mean follow-up of three years and six months (five months to eight years and two months). There were ten women and 19 men, with a mean age of 47 years and seven months (21 years to 59 years and five months). No early (< 6 weeks) or late (> 6 weeks) complications occurred following their THR. The mean pre-operative Harris hip score (HHS) was 27 (6 to 56) and the mean post-operative HHS was 86 (73 to 91), giving a mean improvement of 59 points (p = < 0.05, Student's t-test). No revision procedures had been undertaken in any of the patients, and none had any symptoms consistent with aseptic loosening. This study demonstrates that it is safe to perform THR in HIV-positive patients, with good short-term functional outcomes and no apparent increase in the risk of early infection.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692611","annotations":[{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.785671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Haemophilia","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.628222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"United States Department of Health and Human Services","weight":0.370755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.23476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"List of aviation, aerospace and aeronautical abbreviations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aviation,_aerospace_and_aeronautical_abbreviations"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"}]}
