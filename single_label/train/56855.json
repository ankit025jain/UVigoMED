{"id":56855,"title":"Comparison of transcanalicular diode laser dacryocystorhinostomy and external dacryocystorhinostomy in patients with primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction.","abstract":"To compare the success, complication, and patient discomfort rates of transcanalicular diode laser dacryocystorhinostomy (TCDL-DCR) and external dacryocystorhinostomy (EX-DCR) surgeries performed in patients with primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction.Eighty consecutive patients were included in the study, and groups were assigned according to DCR technique. Thirty-four (42.5%) patients received TCDL-DCR (Group A) and 46 (57.5%) patients (Group B) received EX-DCR with temporary silicone stent intubation. The success of surgery was determined by the relief of epiphora, patient satisfaction, endoscopic evaluation of ostium patency, and lacrimal system syringing. Pearson Chi-Square test, Fisher's Exact test, and Student's t-test were used for statistical analyses.Group A included 22 females and 12 males with a mean age of 49.1?±?15.1 years, Group B included 35 females and 11 males with a mean age of 50.8?±?11.7 years. There was no difference between groups in terms of age and gender (P?=?0.905 and P?=?0.167, respectively). The duration of the operation was 22.2?±?4.8?minutes for Group A, while it was 56.3?±?15.7?minutes for group B (P?=?0.0001). In two patients in Group A, injury in the medial turbinate was recorded, and in Group B, 14 patients experienced mild to severe perioperative bleeding. The perioperative complication rate was significantly different between the groups (P?=?0.004). Success in relieving symptoms was 79.4% for Group A and 89.1% for Group B. The difference in the success rates was not statistically significant (P?=?0.229).Although EX-DCR success rate was higher than that achieved with TCDL-DCR, the latter, with its shorter duration of surgery, lower perioperative complication rate, and a similar success rate, may be a good and acceptable surgical alternative in treatment of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Eye
