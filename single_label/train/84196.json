{"id":84196,"title":"A study of the factors related to abdominal wound dehiscense.","abstract":"Surgical intervention results in a wound. In practice of surgery, wounds and their management is a fundamental job. Various surgical wounds are created by surgeons including abdominal laparotomy wounds. Therefore disruption of a repaired laparotomy wound is an acute wound failure. Burst abdomen, abdominal wound dehiscence, dehiscence of fascial layers is a postoperative complication and the reported mortality rate is about as high as 45%. Incidence of dehiscence as described in literature ranges from 0.4%-3.5%. No specific single cause is one reason for all wound disruption. Abdominal wound dehiscence, which may occur at any age, has been subject to numerous investigations in the past and reviews of many series of cases have been there in the literature. A good knowledge of risk factors is essential for prophylaxis. High risk cases may get benefit from close observation and early intervention.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154160","annotations":[{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.820214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.622433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.542589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.534623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.148691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Early childhood intervention","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood_intervention"},{"name":"Burst (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burst_(band)"},{"name":"Marion True","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_True"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Wound dehiscence","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_dehiscence"}]}
