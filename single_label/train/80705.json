{"id":80705,"title":"Differential expression and glycosylation of proteins in the rat ileal epithelium in response to Echinostoma caproni infection.","abstract":"Echinostoma caproni (Trematoda: Echinostomatidae) is an intestinal trematode that has been used as experimental model to investigate the factors determining the expulsion of intestinal helminths. We analyze the changes in the protein expression and glycosylation induced by E. caproni in Wistar rat, a host of low compatibility in which the parasites are rapidly rejected. To determine the changes in protein expression, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis was employed using protein extracts from the intestine of na√Øve and infected rats. The patterns of glycosylation were analyzed by lectin blotting. Those spots showing differential expression or glycosylation were analyzed by mass spectrometry. A total of 33 protein spots differentially expressed were identified (26 were found to be over-expressed and 7 down-regulated). Moreover, E. caproni induced changes in the glycosylation status of 8 proteins that were successfully identified. Most of these proteins were related to the cytoskeleton and the maintenance of the functional integrity of the ileal epithelium. This suggests that the regeneration of the intestinal tissue is a major effector mechanism responsible for the early expulsion of this helminth. Furthermore, several proteins involved in the energy metabolism were also altered in the ileum of rats as a consequence of the E. caproni infection.Our analysis provides essential new insights in the factors determining the natural expulsion of intestinal parasitic helminths from their hosts. The results obtained contribute to a better understanding of the effective mechanisms involved in the defense against the intestinal helminths. The identification of proteins in the intestine that become modified in their expression or glycosylation in hosts in which the parasite is rapidly rejected may serve for the development of tools for the control of these infections.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565694","annotations":[{"name":"Trematoda","weight":0.911937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda"},{"name":"Parasitic worm","weight":0.894979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm"},{"name":"Cytoskeleton","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton"},{"name":"Lectin","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectin"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.757491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.63575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.414275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.380984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.204458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.19681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Bioenergetics","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergetics"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0568479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Brown rat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rat"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Differential equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"}]}
