{"id":77397,"title":"[Difficulties of a longitudinal epidemiological follow-up study in French occupational medicine].","abstract":"This study was designed to describe the difficulties of epidemiological follow-up of employees by occupational health services.This study was based on two transverse studies conducted by the Pays de la Loire musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) surveillance network. Eighty-three occupational health physicians included 3,710 employees between 2002 and 2005 and had to review them between 2007 and 2009. Thirteen of these physicians changed jobs and 7 changed geographical sector in the same occupational health service.Another 94 physicians were contacted and 85 agreed to participate in the network. The follow-up rate was 43%: 1,044 employees were reviewed by the physician who saw them on inclusion and 567 employees were reviewed by another physician of the network. The other employees were distributed as follows: 25% were lost to follow-up and their occupational status remained unknown; 23% were still employed with an identified occupational health physician but had not attended a medical visit during the follow-up study; 5% had left the occupational health surveillance system. Only 23 employees refused to participate in the follow-up and 105 employees had a physician who refused to participate.There is therefore a considerable mobility of occupational health physicians, which interfered with follow-up despite their good mobilization and a high percentage of employee are lost to follow-up after having left their jobs. More appropriate systems must be set up to follow populations of employees, such as new collaborations with general practitioners.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24893513","annotations":[{"name":"Occupational medicine","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_medicine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal disorder","weight":0.712708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.553926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"France","weight":0.457444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.303847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.299542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Clinical surveillance","weight":0.135098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_surveillance"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Employee","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee"},{"name":"Pays de la Loire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pays_de_la_Loire"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"710","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/710"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Social mobility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility"},{"name":"Occupational prestige","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_prestige"},{"name":"Loire","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loire"}]}
