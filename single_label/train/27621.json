{"id":27621,"title":"[Clinical research of safflower injection on hibernating myocardial revascularization].","abstract":"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death. Safflower attracts great attention owing to its anti-ischemia/reperfusion injury effect. Ninety-three patients with CAD were included and randomized into safflower treatment group, PCI group and control group. Low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) was performed to measure end-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and wall motion score index (WMSI) to determine the recovery of hibernating myocardium and cardiac function in all patients before treatment and after 3-month follow-up. The study was to investigate the effects of safflower on hibernating myocardial revascularization and cardiac function. It was found that LVEF was significantly improved, while the ESV and WMSI were significantly reduced after 2-week treatment in safflower and PCI treatment groups. No significant differences were found between safflower and PCI treatment groups in ESV, EDV, WMSI and LVEF after treatment Safflower injection effectively improved hibernating myocardial function.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25011274","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.837718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.819453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.778361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.763485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.757546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.73545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.697491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.671483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.39495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Dobutamine","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobutamine"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures","weight":0.103071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology_diagnostic_tests_and_procedures"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Computer-aided design","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design"},{"name":"Safflower","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safflower"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Hibernation","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Democratic Army of Greece","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Army_of_Greece"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"English Standard Version","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Standard_Version"}]}
