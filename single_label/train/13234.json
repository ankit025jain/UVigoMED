{"id":13234,"title":"Application of adaptive nonlinear Granger causality: disclosing network changes before and after absence seizure onset in a genetic rat model.","abstract":"Advanced methods of signal analysis of the preictal and ictal activity dynamics characterizing absence epilepsy in humans with absences and in genetic animal models have revealed new and unknown electroencephalographic characteristics, that has led to new insights and theories.Taking into account that some network associations can be considered as nonlinear, an adaptive nonlinear Granger causality approach was developed and applied to analyze cortico-cortical, cortico-thalamic and intrathalamic network interactions from local field potentials (LFPs). The outcomes of adaptive nonlinear models, constructed based on the properties of electroencephalographic signal and on statistical criteria to optimize the number of coefficients in the models, were compared with the outcomes of linear Granger causality.The nonlinear adaptive method showed statistically significant preictal changes in Granger causality in almost all pairs of channels, as well as ictal changes in cortico-cortical, cortico-thalamic and intrathalamic networks. Current results suggest rearrangement of interactions in the thalamo-cortical network accompanied the transition from preictal to ictal phase.The linear method revealed no preictal and less ictal changes in causality.Achieved results suggest that this proposed adaptive nonlinear method is more sensitive than the linear one to dynamics of network properties. Since changes in coupling were found before the seizure-related increase of LFP signal amplitude and also based on some additional tests it seems likely that they were not spurious and could not result from signal to noise ratio change.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486875","annotations":[{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Signal processing","weight":0.790876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Signal-to-noise ratio","weight":0.731945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio"},{"name":"Nonlinear system","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.678282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.533918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.521852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.490304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.387536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.16113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.159399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Thalamus","weight":0.151377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalamus"},{"name":"Granger causality","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0789213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Local field potential","weight":0.0707274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_field_potential"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0678757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Syllable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Nonlinear regression","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_regression"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Phase transition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"},{"name":"Channel (communications)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(communications)"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Field (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)"}]}
