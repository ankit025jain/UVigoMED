{"id":51444,"title":"A54T polymorphism in the fatty acid binding protein 2 studies in a Saudi population with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"Fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2) is an intracellular protein expressed exclusively in the enterocytes of proximal small intestine. FABP2 has a high affinity for saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids and is believed to be involved in the absorption and transport of dietary fatty acids.This is a case-control study conceded in 438 T2DM cases and 460 subjects with normal glucose levels and non-obese considered as healthy controls. Allelic discrimination was performed using TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism was carried out by real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays using purified DNA.Clinical data and anthropometric measurements except age, glucose levels and lipid profile of the patients were significantly different from those of the controls (p < 0.05). Statistical analyses failed to show any type of significant association of the polymorphism between cases and controls. However logistic regression analyses was suggests that the TT genotype is significantly associated with male patients (p = 0.001). None of the allele or genotypes of FABP2 A54T was associated with T2DM cases versus the controls (AT genotype, OR = 0.85 (0.64-1.12), p = 0.25; TT genotype, OR = 0.66 (0.39-1.11), p = 0.11; T allele, 0.82 (0.67-1.02), p = 0.08).In conclusion, this study suggests that the above named variant in FABP2 gene is not potential contributor to the risk of T2DM and related traits in a Saudi population. However TT genotype is a risk factor for the disease in males.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Endocrine System
