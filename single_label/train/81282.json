{"id":81282,"title":"Restorative aspects of periodontal disease: an update part 1.","abstract":"Today's dentistry is dominated by restorative procedures which are carried out to meet the demands of not only function but also aesthetics. Prosthetic and restorative therapies generally require a healthy periodontium as a prerequisite for successful treatment outcome. A mouth with a healthy periodontium may be affected by restorations of poor quality, and restorations of the highest quality may fail in a mouth with periodontal disease. This is the first of two articles that attempt to explain the concept of the complex question of biologic width and the problems that occur after improper margin placement in the periodontium. Initially, the dimensions of biologic width are considered and then margin placement and reasons for restorative procedures are discussed. This article also addresses the interactions between periodontal tissues and restorative procedures.Understanding the impact of restorative procedures on periodontal health in regular dental examination by dentists can help in early diagnosis and treatment of periodontal diseases. This could prevent further progression of disease and reduce the frequency of tooth loss.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195488","annotations":[{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.714896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.629798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.512277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Tooth loss","weight":0.421683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_loss"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.312522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.293911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Crown lengthening","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_lengthening"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"}]}
