{"id":74070,"title":"Analysis of different activation statuses of human mammary epithelial cells from young and old groups.","abstract":"Human mammary epithelial cells have different proliferative statuses and demonstrate a close relationship with age and cell proliferation. Research on this topic could help understand the occurrence, progression and prognosis of breast cancer. In this article, using significance analysis of a microarray algorithm, we analyzed gene expression profiles of human mammary epithelial cells of different proliferative statuses and different age groups. The results showed there were significant differences in gene expression in the same proliferation status between elderly and young groups. Three common differentially expressed genes were found to dynamically change with the proliferation status and to be closely related to tumorigenesis. We also found elderly group had less status-related differential genes from actively proliferating status to intermediate status and more status- related differential genes from intermediate status than the young group. Finally, functional enrichment analyses allowed evaluation of the detailed roles of these differentially-expressed genes in tumor progression.
