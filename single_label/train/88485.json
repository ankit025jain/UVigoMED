{"id":88485,"title":"Time-lapse in vivo imaging of dorsal root nerve regeneration in mice.","abstract":"Primary sensory axon injury is common after spinal cord and root injuries and causes patients to suffer chronic pain and persistent loss of sensation and motor coordination. The devastating consequences of such injuries are due primarily to the failure of severed axons to regenerate within the damaged CNS. Our understanding of the molecular and cellular events that play key roles in preventing or promoting functional regeneration is far from complete, in part because complex and dynamic changes associated with nerve injury have had to be deduced from comparisons of static images obtained from multiple animals after their death. Revolutionary innovations in optics and mouse transgenics now permit real-time monitoring of regenerating dorsal root axons directly in living animals. Here, we describe detailed procedures for repetitive monitoring of identified axons in a lumbar dorsal root over hours to weeks using both widefield and two-photon microscopes. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of in vivo imaging and provide suggestions based on our own experience for troubleshooting issues associated with repeated anesthetization, an extensive laminectomy, and post-op care. These techniques provide the unprecedented opportunity to obtain novel insights into why sensory axons fail to reenter the spinal cord.
