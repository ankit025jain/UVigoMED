{"id":30994,"title":"A two-phased screening paradigm for evaluating candidate medications for cocaine cessation or relapse prevention: modafinil, levodopa-carbidopa, naltrexone.","abstract":"Cocaine pharmacotherapy trials are often confounded by considerable variability in baseline cocaine-use levels, obscuring possible medication efficacy. Testing the feasibility of using a prerandomization, abstinence-induction protocol, we screened three candidate medications to explore treatment response in patients who did, or did not, achieve abstinence during an extended baseline phase.Eligible treatment-seeking, cocaine-dependent subjects entered a 4-week baseline period (Phase I) with high-value abstinence contingent vouchers and two motivational interviewing sessions, followed by a 12-week medication trial (Phase II) with random assignment stratified on Phase I abstinence status to (1) modafinil (400mg/d), (2) levodopa/carbidopa (800/200mg/d), (3) naltrexone (50mg/d), or (4) placebo. Treatment consisted of thrice-weekly clinic visits for urine benzoylecgonine testing and weekly cognitive behavioral therapy with contingency management targeting medication compliance.Of the 118 subjects enrolled, 81 (80%) completed Phase I, with 33 (41%) achieving abstinence, defined a priori as 6 consecutive cocaine-negative urines. Tests of the interaction of each medication (active versus placebo) by baseline status (abstinent versus nonabstinent) permitted moderator effect analysis. Overall, baseline abstinence predicted better outcome. Cocaine-use outcomes for levodopa and naltrexone treatment differed as a function of Phase I abstinence status, with both medications producing benefit in nonabstinent but not baseline-abstinent subjects. There was no evidence of a moderator effect for modafinil.The two-phase screening trial demonstrated that subgrouping of patients with respect to baseline abstinence status is feasible and clinically useful for exploring cocaine cessation and relapse-prevention effects of candidate medications.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24424425","annotations":[{"name":"Modafinil","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil"},{"name":"Contingency management","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_management"},{"name":"Naltrexone","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naltrexone"},{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"L-DOPA","weight":0.884338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA"},{"name":"Motivational interviewing","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivational_interviewing"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.7643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.745082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Behaviour therapy","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.626514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.57403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.399036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"A priori and a posteriori","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.0214552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"}]}
