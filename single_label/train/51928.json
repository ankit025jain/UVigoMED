{"id":51928,"title":"Geochemical correlates to type 1 diabetes incidence in southeast Sweden: an environmental impact?","abstract":"The authors' aim was to explore whether geological factors contribute to geographical variation in the incidence of type 1 diabetes. All children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in southeastern Sweden during 1977-2006 were defined geographically by their place of residence and were allocated x and y coordinates in the national grid. The population at risk, all children 0-16 years of age, was geocoded in a similar manner. Three of the analyzed minerals in moraine and one of the analyzed minerals in brook water plants were significantly associated with type 1 diabetes at the time of diagnosis. Additionally, the birthplace of the children who subsequently developed diabetes differed in relation to some of the minerals. In communities with high incidence and in communities with low incidence, children were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in areas with the same high or low level of elements. The authors' findings in their pilot study indicate a possible geographical covariation of incidence and some geological factors.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24645426","annotations":[{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Moraine","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moraine"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.711219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Geology","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Geochemistry","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochemistry"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Environmental degradation","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.250506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Stream","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Geographic coordinate system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Covariance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Geocoding","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
