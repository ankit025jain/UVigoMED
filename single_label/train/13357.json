{"id":13357,"title":"Genetic diversity of 3' region of glycoprotein D gene of bovine herpesvirus 1 and 5.","abstract":"Bovine herpesviruses 1 (BoHV-1) and 5 (BoHV-5) are closely related alphaherpesviruses of cattle. While BoHV-1 is mainly associated with respiratory/genital disease and rarely associated with neurological disease, BoHV-5 is the primary agent of meningoencephalitis in cattle. The envelope glycoprotein D of alphaherpesviruses (BoHV-1/gD1 and BoHV-5/gD5) is involved in the early steps of virus infection and may influence virus tropism and neuropathogenesis. This study performed a sequence analysis of the 3' region of gD gene (gD3') of BoHV-1 isolates recovered from respiratory/genital disease (n = 6 and reference strain Cooper) or from neurological disease (n = 7); and from seven typical neurological BoHV-5 isolates. After PCR amplification, nucleotide (nt) sequencing, and aminoacid (aa) sequence prediction; gD3' sequences were compared, identity levels were calculated, and selective pressure was analyzed. The phylogenetic reconstruction based on nt and aa sequences allowed for a clear differentiation of BoHV-1 (n = 14) and BoHV-5 (n = 7) clusters. The seven BoHV-1 isolates from neurological disease are grouped within the BoHV-1 branch. A consistent alignment of 346 nt revealed a high similarity within each viral species (gD1 = 98.3 % nt and aa; gD5 = 97.8 % nt and 85.8 % aa) and an expected lower similarity between gD1 and gD5 (73.7 and 64.1 %, nt and aa, respectively). The analysis of molecular evolution revealed an average negative selection at gD3'. Thus, the phylogeny and similarity levels allowed for differentiation of BoHV-1 and BoHV-5 species, but not further division in subspecies. Sequence analysis did not allow for the identification of genetic differences in gD3' potentially associated with the respective clinical/pathological phenotypes, yet revealed a lower level of gD3' conservation than previously reported.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482291","annotations":[{"name":"Strain
