{"id":67257,"title":"Omental infarct in a hernia: an unusual cause of paediatric acute scrotum.","abstract":"We report a case of paediatric acute scrotum due to segmental haemorrhagic infarct of the omentum secondary to strangulation in the left inguinal hernia in a toddler as initial presentation after hernia being noticed by mother once earlier. A 4-year-old boy with non-traumatic acute left scrotum who had a history of left inguinal swelling once earlier presented with massively swollen, painful and discoloured left hemiscrotum extending into the groin simulating acute testicular torsion. Interestingly, there was a segmental omental infarct which precipitated the emergency and had ipsilateral testicular ascent and atrophy as long-term sequelae. Strangulated segmental omental infarct is a rare cause of acute abdomen/scrotum in children. Omentum is a very rare content of inguinal hernia in a toddler and infarct is exceptional. The diagnosis is usually not established before surgery in children. It should be included in the differential diagnoses of acute scrotum, especially in patients with untreated inguinal hernia.
