{"id":81881,"title":"Preliminary antiplaque efficacy of aloe vera mouthwash on 4 day plaque re-growth model: randomized control trial.","abstract":"Due to increasing resistance to antibiotics and rising incidence of oral diseases, there is a need for alternative treatment modalities to combat oral diseases. The aim of the present study was to access the effect of Aloe vera mouthwash on the dental plaque in the experimental period of 4 days and to compare it with the bench mark control chlorhexidine and placebo (saline water).A total of 300 systemically healthy subjects were randomly allocated into 3 groups: Aloe vera mouthwash group (n=100), control group (=100)-chlorhexidene group and saline water-Placebo (n=100). To begin with, Gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) were recorded. Then, baseline plaque scores were brought to zero by professionally cleaning the teeth with scaling and polishing. After randomization of the participants into three groups they were refrained from regular mechanical oral hygiene measures. Subjects were asked to swish with respective mouthwash (Aloe vera mouthwash, 0.2%chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash, or normal saline) as per therapeutic dose for 4 days.The results showed that Aloe vera mouthrinse is equally effective in reducing plaque as Chlorhexidine compared to placebo over a period of 4 days. There was a significant reduction on plaque in Aloe vera and chlorhexidine groups and no statistically significant difference was observed among them (p>0.05). Aloe vera mouthwash showed no side effects.The results of the present study indicated that Aloe vera may prove an effective mouthwash due to its ability in reducing dental plaque.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795515","annotations":[{"name":"Chlorhexidine","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.855214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Mouthwash","weight":0.715166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthwash"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.693139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.647665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.534181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.533261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.476491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.472668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.336368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Aloe","weight":0.321135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloe"},{"name":"Aloe vera","weight":0.272756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloe_vera"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Saline water","weight":0.0808391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water"},{"name":"Therapeutic index","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Polishing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polishing"},{"name":"Gluconic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconic_acid"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"}]}
