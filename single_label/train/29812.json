{"id":29812,"title":"ADHD, impulsivity and alcohol abuse: methods, results, and implications.","abstract":"In this Special Section, the relationships among attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), impulsivity, and alcohol abuse are explored by 4 diverse studies. Among these excellent studies, the constructs indicated in the issue title varied in definitions, measurement methods, and interpretive implications. The experimental approaches also varied, including cross-sectional examination of candidate genes in children, determination of long-term outcomes, laboratory tasks to measure attention and inhibition, and alcohol administration. These diverse topics and approaches yielded insights into the etiology and effects of alcohol abuse and indicated research directions that will advance this field.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611836","annotations":[{"name":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.806949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.738002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.629798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.599967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.482581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.221043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Impulsivity","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulsivity"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.129985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Social constructionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"}]}
