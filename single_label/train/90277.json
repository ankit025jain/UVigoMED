{"id":90277,"title":"Fracture prediction and the definition of osteoporosis in children and adolescents: the ISCD 2013 Pediatric Official Positions.","abstract":"The ISCD 2007 Pediatric Official Positions define osteoporosis in children on the basis of fracture history and low bone density, adjusted as appropriate for age, gender, and body size. The task force on fracture prediction and osteoporosis definition has reviewed these positions and suggests modifications with respect to vertebral fracture and the definition of a significant fracture history and draws attention to the need to consider degree of trauma as a factor that may modify fracture risk prediction.
