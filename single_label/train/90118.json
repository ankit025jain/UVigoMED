{"id":90118,"title":"Local anesthetic wound infiltration for pain management after periacetabular osteotomy. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial with 53 patients.","abstract":"To our knowledge, there is no evidence to support the use of local infiltration analgesia (LIA) for postoperative pain relief after periacetabular osteotomy (PAO). We investigated the effect of wound infiltration with a long-acting local anesthetic (ropivacaine) for postoperative analgesia after PAO.Infiltration with 75 mL (150 mg) of ropivacaine did not reduce postoperative pain or opioid requirements during the first 4 days.The clinical importance of ropivacaine as single component in postoperative treatment of pain is questionable, and we are planning further studies to explore the potential of LIA in larger volume-and also a multimodal regimen-to treat pain in this category of patients.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650022","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Local anesthetic","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthetic"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.573664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.341109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Ropivacaine","weight":0.0388889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ropivacaine"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Lia (singer)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lia_(singer)"},{"name":"Multimodal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
