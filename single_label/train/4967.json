{"id":4967,"title":"Reverse shoulder prosthesis: implementation and experience in Croatia.","abstract":"Reverse shoulder prosthesis has become one of the most often used prosthetic implants in shoulder replacement surgery. It has a wide spectrum of indications, starting from comminuted humeral fractures and posttraumatic arthritis to arthritis caused by the rotator cuff loss. Its application at our hospital began in 2004, at first in few specific cases and with time in ever growing number of patients. Over 8 years, more than 250 reverse shoulder prostheses were implanted at our institution. In addition, our surgeons supervised its application in other hospitals all over Croatia. In the postoperative course, the shoulder was immobilized for 4-6 weeks with a thoracobrachial cast. After removal of the cast, physical therapy was initiated. The length of physical therapy program depended upon many factors. As a rule, immobilization lasted longer in patients that were operated on due to posttraumatic arthritis and those that suffered from deltoid muscle atrophy and shoulder contracture before surgery. Complications included dislocation of the prosthesis shortly after surgery (in the first four weeks) and infection. Infection was a special problem and treatment included even explantation of the prosthesis.","date":"2014-12-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509240","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.864089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.845287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rotator cuff","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.665194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Muscle atrophy","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_atrophy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.415194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Shoulder replacement","weight":0.369202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_replacement"},{"name":"Croatia","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Orthopedic cast","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_cast"},{"name":"Deltoid muscle","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltoid_muscle"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"}]}
