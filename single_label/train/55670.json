{"id":55670,"title":"Cost evaluation of surgical and pharmaceutical options in treatment for vitreomacular adhesions and macular holes.","abstract":"To evaluate cost-effectiveness and cost utilities for treatment options for vitreomacular adhesions (VMAs) and full-thickness macular holes (MHs).A Markov model of cost-effectiveness and utility.There were no participants.Outcomes of published clinical trials (index studies) of surgical treatment of VMAs and MHs and a prospective, multicenter clinical trial of pharmaceutical vitreolysis with intravitreal ocriplasmin with saline control were used to generate a model for costs of treatment and visual benefits. All techniques were assumed to result in a 2.5-line visual benefit if anatomy was resolved. Markov analysis, with cost data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was used to calculate imputed costs for each primary treatment modality in a facility setting, with surgery performed in a hospital serving as the highest end of the range and nonfacility setting with surgery performed in an ambulatory surgery center serving as the lowest end of the range.Imputed costs of therapy, cost per line saved, cost per line-year saved, cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).When pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was selected as the primary procedure, the overall imputed cost ranged from $5802 to $7931. The cost per line was $2368 to $3237, the cost per line-year saved was $163 to $233 and the cost per QALY was $5444 to $7442. If intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin was the primary procedure, the overall imputed cost was $8767 to $10 977. The cost per line ranged from $3549 to $4456, the cost per line-year saved was $245 to $307, and the cost per QALY was between $8159 and $10 244. If intravitreal saline injection was used as a primary procedure, the overall imputed cost was $5828 to $8098. The cost per line was $2374 to $3299, the cost per line-year saved was $164 to $227, and the cost per QALY was $5458 to $7583.As a primary procedure, PPV was the most cost-effective therapy in this model. The other treatments had similar costs per QALY saved and compare favorably with costs of therapy for other retinal diseases.","date":"2014-08-25","categories":"Eye
