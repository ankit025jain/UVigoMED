{"id":2843,"title":"Risk factors for pterygium recurrence after surgical excision with combined conjunctival autograft (CAG) and intraoperative antimetabolite use.","abstract":"To identify the determinants of recurrence following primary pterygium excision combined with conjunctival autograft (CAG) and intraoperative use of Mitomycin C (MMC) or 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU).A randomized controlled clinical trial comparing 5-FU (50 mg/ml) plus CAG versus MMC (0.01%) plus CAG in preventing recurrence of primary pterygium following excision.A total of 80 eyes of 80 subjects were studied, with 46 eyes in the 5-FU group and 34 eyes in the MMC group. The mean age was 50.7 +/- 13.1 years with a male: female ratio of 0.95:1. Mean follow up period was 35.2 +/- 29.1 weeks. The overall recurrence rate was 10%, with a rate of 8.7% in the 5-FU group and 11.8% in the MMC group. The mean age of the patients who had a recurrence was 38.1 +/- 13.3 years compared to 52.1 +/- 12.4 years in those without a recurrence (p = 0.003). The median size of the pterygium in patients who had a recurrence was 3.2mm, while the median size in patients who did not have a recurrence was 3.0mm (p = 0.8). Five (12.8%) males had a recurrence compared to three (7.3%) females (p = 0.48); while 10.5% of fleshy pterygia recurred compared to none (0%) of the non-fleshy pterygia (p = 1.00).Younger age remains a risk factor for recurrence when both CAG and antimetabolites are combined in the treatment of pterygium, while the effect of gender, size and morphology of the pterygium may be diminished by such combination.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335376","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.839154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Antimetabolite","weight":0.756653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimetabolite"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.684857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.631501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Mitomycin","weight":0.592152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitomycin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.329587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.230134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Pterygium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterygium"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"MultiMediaCard","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMediaCard"},{"name":"Professional wrestling throws","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_throws"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"10.5 (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
