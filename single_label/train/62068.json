{"id":62068,"title":"F-18 FDG-PET predicts outcomes for patients receiving total lymphoid irradiation and autologous blood stem-cell transplantation for relapsed and refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.","abstract":"Total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (aHSCT) is an effective strategy for patients with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). We report outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory HL who received TLI followed by high-dose chemotherapy and aHSCT. Pre-transplant fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) studies were scored on the 5-point Deauville scale. Of 51 patients treated with TLI and aHSCT, 59% had primary refractory disease and 63% had active disease at aHSCT. The 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for all patients was 56% and 54%, respectively. Patients with complete response (CR) by PET prior to aHSCT had a 5-year PFS and OS of 85% and 100% compared to 52% and 48% for those without CR (P = 0·09 and P = 0·007, respectively). TLI and aHSCT yields excellent disease control and long-term survival rates for patients with relapsed/refractory HL, including those with high-risk disease features. Achievement of CR with salvage therapy is a powerful predictor of outcome.
