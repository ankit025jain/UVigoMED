{"id":63892,"title":"Evaluation of Brugia malayi sheath protein (Shp-1) as a diagnostic antigen for human lymphatic filariasis.","abstract":"Lymphatic filariasis is the second leading cause of permanent long-term disability globally and control of this disease needs efficient diagnostic methods. In this study, abundantly expressing microfilarial sheath protein (Shp-1) from Brugia malayi was characterized as a filarial diagnostic candidate using samples from different clinical population. Monoclonal antibodies were developed against E. coli expressed recombinant Shp-1 in order to assess its efficiency in filarial antigen detection assay system. Endemic Normal (EN, n = 170), asymptomatic microfilaeremics (MF, n = 65), symptomatic chronic pathology (CP, n = 45) and non endemic normal (NEN, n = 10) sera were analyzed by antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of the 290 individuals, all MF individuals (both brugian and bancroftian) were positive in this assay followed by CP and EN. When compared with SXP-1 and Og4C3 antigen assays, all assays detected Wb MF correctly, Bm MF was detected by Shp-1 and SXP-1 assays, and only Shp-1 was able to detect EN (12%) and CP (29%). Results showed that this assay may be useful for monitoring prior to mass drug administration.
