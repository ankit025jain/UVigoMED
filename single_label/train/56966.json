{"id":56966,"title":"[Blood rheological characteristics of uteroplacental blood flow in severe gestosis].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical and morphological features of uteroplacental blood flow during pregnancy in severe gestosis.One hundred and twenty-five patients with severe gestosis were examined. Scanning probe and electron microscopy with macro- and microelement analysis and transmission microscopy were used to study their placentas, umbilical cords, endometrium, myometrium, and maternal blood in severe gestosis.It is shown that circulatory disorders in the structural components of the examined tissues and organs, as well as changes in cytoarchitectonics and red blood cell functional properties may be a component of the trigger of disseminated intravascular coagulation, followed by impaired maternal and fetal vital activity.The investigation of the pathomorphological features of the microcirculatory bed in the mother-placenta-fetus system in gestosis has shown that possible methods of their correction should be further sought.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306609","annotations":[{"name":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Placenta","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.815853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.658874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.446028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.370684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.360433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.355524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.349137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Myometrium","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myometrium"},{"name":"Vitalism","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.115947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Rheology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheology"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Mother","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"}]}
