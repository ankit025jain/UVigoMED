{"id":62379,"title":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation conditioning with use of rituximab in EBV related lymphoproliferative disorders.","abstract":"X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) and IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) deficiency are rare immunodeficiencies with a spectrum of clinical manifestations. Although there are no official guidelines for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in these patients, previous reports have shown that reduced intensity conditioning regimens provide successful engraftment with limited toxicity. Here, we report on three children with XLP and one with ITK deficiency, who underwent successful HSCT using a rituximab containing conditioning regimen, and review the current literature.
