{"id":13816,"title":"Increased density of inhibitory noradrenergic parenchymal nerve fibers in hypertrophic islets of Langerhans of obese mice.","abstract":"We sought to identify mechanisms of beta cell failure in genetically obese mice. Little is known about the role of pancreatic innervation in the progression of beta cell failure. In this work we studied adrenergic innervation, in view of its potent inhibitory effect on insulin secretion. We analyzed genetically obese ob/ob and db/db mice at different ages (6- and 15-week-old), corresponding to different compensatory stages in the course of beta cell dysfunction. 15 week-old HFD mice were also studied.All mice were characterized by measures of plasma glucose, insulin, and HOMA. After perfusion, pancreata were dissected and studied by light microscopy, electron microscopy, and morphometry. Insulin, Tyrosine Hydroxylase-positive fibers and cells and Neuropeptide Y-positive cells were scored by immunohistochemistry. Islets of obese mice showed increased noradrenergic fiber innervation, with significant increases of synaptoid structures contacting beta cells compared to controls. Noradrenergic innervation of the endocrine area in obese db/db mice tended to increase with age, as diabetes progressed. In ob/ob mice, we also detected an age-dependent trend toward increased noradrenergic innervation that, unlike in db/db mice, was unrelated to glucose levels. We also observed a progressive increase in Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive elements localized to the islet core.Our data show increased numbers of sympathetic nerve fibers with a potential to convey inhibitory signals on insulin secretion in pancreatic islets of genetically obese animals, regardless of their diabetic state. The findings suggest an alternative interpretation of the pathogenesis of beta cell failure, as well as novel strategies to reverse abnormalities in insulin secretion.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462047","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Beta cell","weight":0.896071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_cell"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Neuropeptide","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropeptide"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.796656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Norepinephrine","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.680189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.65969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.656323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.592836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.409099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.220642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Homeostatic model assessment","weight":0.176385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostatic_model_assessment"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.163883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0400049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Langerhans cell","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langerhans_cell"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"}]}
