{"id":20307,"title":"Clustered pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma in a young man: a case report.","abstract":"Pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma is a rare, benign lung tumor that usually occurs in middle-aged women. It usually manifests as isolated pulmonary nodules and is often confused with other solitary, benign nodules. We present a case of sclerosing pneumocytoma with clustered lung nodules and surrounding ground-glass opacity in a single lobe in a young man. Progressive growth was seen on serial computed tomography observations, and the nodules appeared similar to those seen in active pulmonary tuberculosis.
