{"id":77076,"title":"Biomarkers associated with obesity and overweight in the Roma population residing in eastern Slovakia.","abstract":"Obesity and overweight are major contributors to the global burden of chronic diseases and disability in both majority and minority populations.Data from the cross-sectional population-based HepaMeta study conducted in Slovakia in 2011 were used. The sample comprised a total of 452 Roma. Measurements of special bioactive mediators were taken in final groups consisting of 63 male Roma respondents (mean age = 32.59; SD = 8.63) and 117 female Roma respondents (mean age = 34.55; SD = 8.35). Respondents were divided into three groups: those with normal weight, those with overweight and obese. Values for anthropometric parameters, lipids parameters, C-reactive protein, TNF-alpha, IL-6, leptin, and adiponectin were determined.27.6% of examined Roma females and 26.9% of males were overweight. Obesity (BMI > 30.0 kg/m2) appeared in a higher proportion of males (28.8%) compared with female (26.5%). Mean levels of total cholesterol, triacylglycerol and LDL-cholesterol were significantly elevated in the overweight and obese subjects compared to normal-weight Roma respondents. The relation was reversed for HDL-C level, with significantly decreased levels in both male and female obese Roma (p < 0.001). The concentration of adiponectin was significantly lower in obese subjects of both genders versus non-obese (Roma male p < 0.001, Roma female p < 0.05). Plasma levels of leptin, IL-6, hs-CRP as well as TNF-alpha increased in Roma significantly with increasing BMI.The study is the first one to provide data about selected biomarkers. Results may be useful in predicting obesity and its related diseases in the Roma population from the eastern part of Slovakia.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847609","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.831748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.824891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.756407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.532101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.524734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.47411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.283171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.182153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Slovakia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia"},{"name":"High-Level Data Link Control","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Data_Link_Control"},{"name":"Romani people","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
