{"id":45787,"title":"The effect of intraoperative fluid volume administration on pancreatic fistulas after pancreaticoduodenectomy.","abstract":"Fluid therapy may be one of the most controversial topics in perioperative management. However, data concerning the influence of perioperative fluid administration on complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy are sparse.A group of 147 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for benign or malignant pathology of the pancreas or the periampullary region between 2005 and 2009. Clinical data, overall morbidity, and long-term outcomes were recorded.We categorized the patients into two groups according to intraoperative fluid volume administration: a low fluid volume group (LFVG, <8.2 ml kg(-1) hr(-1), n = 90) group, and a high fluid volume group (HFVG, ?8.2 ml kg(-1) hr(-1), n = 57). In terms of colloid administration, the high fluid volume group received significantly more colloid both during the intraoperative period and 0-12 hr after surgery (p < .001 and p < .007, respectively). Pancreatic fistula rates were significantly greater in the high fluid volume group (p = .035). However, the long-term survival rate was not different between the two groups.High intraoperative fluid volume administration is associated with an increased incidence of pancreatic fistulas after pancreaticoduodenectomy.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24665844","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.832728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.796716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.770154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.523975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.400137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.374283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Colloid","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.272282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Ampulla of Vater","weight":0.211979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampulla_of_Vater"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.113499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Volume group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_group"},{"name":"Pancreatic fistula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_fistula"},{"name":"Hr1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hr1"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Sparse matrix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
