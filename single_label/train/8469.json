{"id":8469,"title":"A critical role of hypocretin deficiency in pregnancy.","abstract":"Hypocretin/orexin peptides are known for their role in the control of the wake–sleep cycle and narcolepsy–cataplexy pathophysiology. Recent studies suggested that hypocretin peptides also have a role in pregnancy. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a retrospective analysis on pregnancy complications in two different mouse models of hypocretin deficiency. We recorded 85 pregnancies of mice lacking either hypocretin peptides (knockout) or hypocretin-releasing neurons (transgenic) and their wild-type controls. Pregnancy was associated with unexplained dam death before delivery in 3/15 pregnancies in knockout mice, and in 3/23 pregnancies in transgenic mice. No casualties occurred in wild-type pregnant dams (P < 0.007 versus hypocretin-deficient mice as a whole). Hypocretin deficiency did not impact either on litter size or the number of weaned pups per litter. These data provide preliminary evidence of a critical role of hypocretin deficiency in pregnancy.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772478","annotations":[{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.77844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.756014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.709617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.608781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.552287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Genetically modified organism","weight":0.443655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism"},{"name":"Weaning","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Orexin","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orexin"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"315","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/315"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Dam","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam"},{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Litter (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_(animal)"},{"name":"Casualty (person)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_(person)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
