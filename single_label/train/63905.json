{"id":63905,"title":"Older people's perception of anemia in rural southwest Uganda.","abstract":"To describe older people's perceptions of anemia in a rural Ugandan population.Quantitative and qualitative data on anemia were collected from participants aged ?50 years from January 2012 to January 2013 using questionnaires and in-depth interviews. Quantitative data were collected from 1,455 participants. Qualitative data were collected from 10 people who were purposively selected. Data were analyzed using STATA software and thematic content analysis.33.8% men and 17.4% women had anemia. Older people perceived themselves to be anemic because of symptoms and beliefs about causes. Those with anemia were more likely to perceive that they had anemia (18.4% vs. 10.2%, p < .001). Poor diet, diseases, poor living conditions, and over work were mentioned as causes of anemia. Use of traditional methods for treating anemia was common.Anemia prevention and control programs in Uganda should target older people and correct misconceptions about the causes and treatment of anemia.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24388898","annotations":[{"name":"Data","weight":0.539368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.503763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Qualitative data","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_data"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.378818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Content analysis","weight":0.369643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_analysis"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.315961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.250837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.230397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Numerical data","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_data"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.176142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.14086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.135569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Uganda","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Stata","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"10.2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.2"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"}]}
