{"id":45705,"title":"[Surgical management of cervical esophageal carcinoma in 16 cases].","abstract":"To investigate the method of surgical management for cervical esophageal carcinoma and the feasibility of the operation with preservation of laryngeal function.Sixteen patients with cervical esophageal carcinoma who received surgical treatment were reviewed in our retrospective study. Removal of total hypopharynx and larynx and the inversion stripping esophagectomy were conducted in thirteen patients, of which one underwent the reconstraction with residual larynx and tracheal flap and the other twelve patients underwent the reconstraction with gastric-pharyngeal anastomosis. One patient received the cervical esophagectomy and partial hypopharyngectomy with laryngotracheal flap. The inversion stripping esophagectomy with laryngeal function preservation were conducted in two patients, who received the reconstraction with gastric-pharyngeal anastomosis and preserved total larynx. All the patients were carried out the bilateral neck dissections.The surgical resection rate was 100% and no operative death occurred. The postoperative complications included pulmonary infection in two cases, anastomotic fistula in two cases, anastomotic stenosis in two cases and congestive heart failure in one case. The retained rate of the laryngeal function is 12.5%. The 3-year survival rate is 30.7%, and the 5-year survival rate is 23.1%.The surgical treatment of cervical esophageal carcinoma is possible. The inversion stripping esophagectomy without thoracotomy is performed to resect the tumor. The esophageal defect could be reconstructed by laryngotracheal flap or gastric-pharyngeal anastomosis. The laryngeal function should be remained as far as possible according to the location and extension of the tumor.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669682","annotations":[{"name":"Esophagectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagectomy"},{"name":"Thoracotomy","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy"},{"name":"Hypopharynx","weight":0.851453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopharynx"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.743951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.689984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.452271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.329746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.251631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Food preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_preservation"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Bilateral symmetry","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_symmetry"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"}]}
