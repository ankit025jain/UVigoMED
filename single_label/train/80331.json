{"id":80331,"title":"Regulatory effects of IL-18 on cytokine profiles and development of myocarditis during Trypanosoma cruzi infection.","abstract":"Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc), is an important cause of heart disease. Resistance to Tc infection is multifactorial and associated with Th1 response. IL-18 plays an important role in regulation of IFN-? production/development of Th1 response. However, the role of IL-18 in the setting of Tc infection remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the role of IL-18 in the modulation of immune response and myocarditis in Tc infection. C57BL/6 and IL-18 KO mice were infected with Tc (Y or Colombian strain) and parasitemia, immune response and pathology were evaluated. Y strain infection of IL-18 KO did not alter any parameters when compared with C57BL/6 mice. However, during the acute phase (20 and 40 days post infection-dpi), Colombian strain infected-IL-18 KO mice displayed higher serum levels of IL-12 and IFN-?, respectively, and at the chronic phase (100 dpi) an increase in splenic IFN-?-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T memory cells. There was an IL-10, FOXP3 and CD4(+)CD25(+) cells reduction during acute infection in spleen. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in leukocyte infiltration and parasite load in myocardium of chronically infected IL-18 KO mice. Collectively, these data indicate that IL-18 contributes to the pathogenesis of Tc-induced myocarditis when infected with Colombian but not Y strain. These observations also underscore that parasite and host strain differences are important in evaluation of experimental Tc infection pathogenesis.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Parasitic
