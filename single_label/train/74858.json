{"id":74858,"title":"tRNAs: new tricks from old dogs.","abstract":"tRNA biology has lately seen a revival with the discovery of tRNA cleavage products as mediators of stress responses. In this issue of The EMBO Journal, Blanco et al now report that tRNA methylation, by protecting from cleavage, is relevant for normal brain development. The versatility of tRNA is further emphasized by a recent study in Cell that uncovered differential expression of tRNAs as a means to accustom codon usage bias to the needs in proliferating versus differentiating cells.","date":"2014-09-18","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25216676","annotations":[{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Transfer RNA","weight":0.478737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_RNA"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Codon usage bias","weight":0.204468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codon_usage_bias"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.14551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Cleavage (embryo)","weight":0.0189469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(embryo)"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"European Molecular Biology Organization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Molecular_Biology_Organization"},{"name":"The EMBO Journal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_EMBO_Journal"},{"name":"Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery-MacLeod-McCarty_experiment"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"}]}
