{"id":35721,"title":"Psychiatric symptoms in boys with fragile X syndrome: a comparison with nonsyndromic autism spectrum disorder.","abstract":"In the present study, we examined the profile of psychiatric symptoms in boys with fragile X syndrome (FXS) using a parent report instrument. In addition, by comparing boys with FXS to boys with nonsyndromic autism spectrum disorder (ASD) utilizing multiple matching strategies, we examined between-group differences in the types of psychiatric symptoms observed and in the strength of their concurrent associations. Across all matching strategies, symptoms of manic/hyperactive behaviors and general anxiety were more frequently reported for boys with FXS than for boys with nonsyndromic ASD. Results also indicated a positive association between social avoidance and general anxiety in FXS that was stronger than that observed in nonsyndromic ASD across all matching strategies. Theoretical and treatment implications are discussed.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629733","annotations":[{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"},{"name":"Autism","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.735806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.665421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.650234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Fragile X syndrome","weight":0.526479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_X_syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Spectrum (psychiatry)","weight":0.305211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(psychiatry)"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Foreign exchange station","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_station"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Avoidant personality disorder","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Nonsyndromic deafness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsyndromic_deafness"}]}
