{"id":68887,"title":"Lipoprotein glomerulopathy may provide a key to unlock the puzzles of renal lipidosis.","abstract":"Lipoprotein glomerulopathy is an inherited renal disease characterized by unique lipoprotein thrombi in the glomerulus and is associated with the APOE mutation. Hu and colleagues investigated the genetic and clinical features of a large group of patients with lipoprotein glomerulopathy who carried APOE Kyoto, a major APOE variant. Their findings suggest its descent through a founder effect. Fibrate therapy in this group showed favorable results in the patient and renal survival rates.
