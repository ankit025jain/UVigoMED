{"id":87772,"title":"Outcomes using titanium elastic nails for open and closed pediatric tibia fractures.","abstract":"The authors conducted a retrospective review at their level I trauma center to assess the outcomes of closed vs open pediatric tibial fractures treated with titanium elastic nails. The study group included 38 pediatric patients (median age, 12 years) treated with titanium elastic nails for tibial fractures during a 5-year period. Patient demographics, closed or open injury, Gustilo-Anderson type for open fractures, fracture location, skeletal maturity, time to union, hospital length of stay, number of procedures performed per patient, and complications were recorded. The main outcome measures were time to union and complications. Average follow-up duration was 13 months. Mean time to union was 4 months for closed and 9 months for open fractures (P<.001). Average time to union for type IIIA and IIIB fractures was significantly increased (11 and 12 months, respectively; P=.02). Delayed union (>6 months postoperatively) occurred in 1 (6%) of 17 closed fractures compared with 11 (52%) of 21 open fractures. The average number of surgical procedures for closed fractures was fewer than for open fractures (2 vs 3 procedures, respectively; P=.03). Mean hospital length of stay was shorter for closed than open fractures (3 vs 6 days, respectively; P=.03). Two infections occurred in the open fracture group. Closed and open pediatric tibial shaft fractures can be successfully treated with titanium elastic nails. Open fractures treated with titanium elastic nails have a significantly longer time to union, require additional operative procedures, and result in longer hospital stays.
