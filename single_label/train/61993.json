{"id":61993,"title":"Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoid malignancies: the expanding spectrum of hematopoietic neoplasms.","abstract":"Ubiquitous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects not only B cells but also T and NK cells, and is associated with various lymphoid malignancies. The spectrum of EBV-associated lymphoid malignancies is expanding from Burkitt lymphoma to the newly defined systemic EBV+ T cell lymphoproliferative disease of childhood and hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma. However, some EBV-associated malignancies are not defined well and overlap other diseases. Furthermore, the role of EBV in tumorigenesis of lymphoid malignancies is still not clear. Further studies are necessary to clarify the pathogenesis of EBV-associated lymphoid malignancies for a better classification of each disease and for the establishment of effective treatment.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640173","annotations":[{"name":"Burkitt's lymphoma","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkitt's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.879672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.837808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphoproliferative disorders","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoproliferative_disorders"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.780462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.746127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.592181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.341334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Medical classification","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_classification"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"}]}
