{"id":73214,"title":"[Reasons of non-radical surgery for patients with primary skin melanoma].","abstract":"It was found that up to now a significant number of patients with primary skin melanoma continued to have non-radical surgery. Based on the analysis of clinical and morphological data on 288 of these patients it was revealed that most non-radical treatment was performed for patients who had had primary skin melanoma of linear dimensions of 1 cm and a pink color. It was proved that patients with tumors of the skin should first be examined by the oncologist. A lack of knowledge of semiotics of primary skin melanoma was revealed among doctors. Widely used diagnostic biopsy of the primary tumor with subsequent cytology is recommended.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919268","annotations":[{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.868908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.797407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.699086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.614865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.561443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.47851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Semiotics","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Pink","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"}]}
