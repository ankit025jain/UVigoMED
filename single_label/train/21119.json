{"id":21119,"title":"Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (spa) mutants in the community and hospitals in Oxfordshire.","abstract":"Staphylococcal protein A (spa) is an important virulence factor which enables Staphylococcus aureus to evade host immune responses. Genotypes known as \"spa-types\", based on highly variable Xr region sequences of the spa-gene, are frequently used to classify strains. A weakness of current spa-typing primers is that rearrangements in the IgG-binding region of the gene cause 1-2% of strains to be designated as \"non-typeable\".We developed an improved primer which enabled sequencing of all strains, containing any type of genetic rearrangement, in a large study among community carriers and hospital inpatients in Oxfordshire, UK (6110 isolates). We identified eight novel spa-gene variants, plus one previously described. Three of these rearrangements would be designated \"non-typeable\" using current spa-typing methods; they occurred in 1.8% (72/3905) asymptomatically carried and 0.6% (14/2205) inpatient S. aureus strains. Some individuals were simultaneously colonized by both formerly non-typeable and typeable strains; previously such patients would have been identified as carrying only currently typeable strains, underestimating mixed carriage prevalence and diversity. Formerly non-typeable strains were found in more spa-types associated with multilocus sequence type ST398 (35%), common among livestock, compared to other groups with any non-typeable strains (1-4%), suggesting particular spa-types may have been under-represented in previous human studies.This improved method allows us to spa-type previously non-typeable strains with rearrangements in the spa-gene and to resolve cases of mixed colonization with deletions in one or more strains, thus accounting for hidden diversity of S. aureus in both community and hospital environments.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621342","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Virulence factor","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence_factor"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.817759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Livestock","weight":0.667473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.240731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.219075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.154959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.14081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Protein A","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_A"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.0401361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Oxfordshire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Multilocus sequence typing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilocus_sequence_typing"}]}
