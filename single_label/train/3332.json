{"id":3332,"title":"Auto-induction for high yield expression of recombinant novel isoallergen tropomyosin from King prawn (Melicertus latisulcatus) for improved diagnostics and immunotherapeutics.","abstract":"Food allergies are increasing worldwide, demonstrating a considerable public health concern. Shellfish allergy is one of the major food groups causing allergic sensitization among adults and children, affecting up to 2% of the general world population. Tropomyosin (TM) is the major allergen in shellfish and frequently used in the diagnosis of allergic sensitization and the detection of cross-contaminated food. To improve and establish better and more sensitive diagnostics for allergies and immunotherapeutics, large quantities of pure allergens are required. To establish a reproducible method for the generation of pure recombinant tropomyosin we utilized in this study different Escherichia coli strains (NM522, TOP10 and BL21(DE3)RIPL). In addition, isopropyl-?-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) induction was compared with a novel auto-induction system to allow the generation of larger quantities of recombinant allergen. We demonstrated that the B-strain of E. coli is better for the expression of TM compared to the K-strain. Moreover, a higher yield could be achieved when using the auto-induction system, with up to 62 mg/l. High yield expressed recombinant TM from King prawn (KP) was compared to recombinant TM from Black tiger prawn (Pen m 1). We demonstrated that recombinant TM from KP and known isoallergen Pen m 1 have very similar molecular and immunological characteristics. Overall, we demonstrate that auto-induction can be used to express larger quantities of recombinant allergens for the development of diagnostic, to quantify allergens as well as immunotherapeutics employing isoallergens.","date":"2014-12-04","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25450004","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Food allergy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_allergy"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.715166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Shellfish","weight":0.699676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellfish"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.638188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"World population","weight":0.626571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.465789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Prawn","weight":0.370962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prawn"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.363821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Food group","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_group"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"New Mexico","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Tiger","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
