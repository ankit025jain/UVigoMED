{"id":86545,"title":"A rare case of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage following oral amphetamine intake.","abstract":"Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a clinical syndrome, which refers to injury to the capillaries, arterioles and venules, leading to red blood cell accumulation in the distal air spaces. It is defined by the clinical triad of hemoptysis, anemia and progressive hypoxemia. Chest radiographs reveal non-specific patchy or diffuse bilateral pulmonary consolidation. Multiple conditions are associated with DAH, of which Wegener's granulomatosis is the most frequent, and underlying disease determines the prognosis and treatment. This case describes DAH as a result of oral amphetamine abuse in a young patient of which the diagnosis was established by laboratory, clinical and radiologic findings. The patient experienced a rapid recovery without significant sequelae.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24765773","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoptysis","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.847721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Hypoxemia","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Amphetamine","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.764492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.617711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.560915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.557244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.513243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Arteriole","weight":0.266027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriole"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.211658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.134255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Venule","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venule"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Pulmonary consolidation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_consolidation"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"}]}
