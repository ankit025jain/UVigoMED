{"id":54039,"title":"Florid cystic endosalpingiosis, masquerading as malignancy in a young patient: a brief review.","abstract":"Endosalpingiosis is a rare condition characterised by the presence of tubal epithelium outside the fallopian tube. Most of the previous case reports have described this condition in women in their fifth decade or older. We report a case of a woman presenting at 31 years with a history of heavy bleeding during menses and pain in the lower abdomen for the past 2 years. An ultrasound examination showed a left ovarian cyst of 4.3Ã—3.2 cm with multiple septations. CA 125 was within normal range. Laparoscopy was performed with the plan of ovarian cystectomy, peroperatively; there were papillary projections all over the uterus and the peritoneal surface. The left ovary was enlarged with papillary projections on the surface. Multiple biopsies were taken from the surface of the uterus, ovary and the peritoneum as the picture was quite suspicious of malignancy. Histopathological examination gave the picture of endosalpingiosis. The patient underwent laparoscopic ovariotomy with fulguration of lesions 4 months later, in view of persistent pain and discomfort, and increase in the size of the cyst on ultrasound monitoring. Presently, she is free of symptoms.
