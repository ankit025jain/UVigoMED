{"id":52021,"title":"Non-HDL-cholesterol in an adolescent diabetes population.","abstract":"Screening for dyslipidemia poses some challenges. Nonfasting lipid profiles frequently have elevated triglycerides. In addition, in the standard lipid profile, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a calculated value rather than a direct measurement and is triglyceride dependent. Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is an alternative method to assess for dyslipidemia and provides a single estimate of all atherogenic apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins.To calculate the non-HDL-C in adolescents with diabetes and to evaluate risk factors associated with an elevated non-HDL-C and to compare the prevalence of dyslipidemia, defined by non-HDL-C, with the prevalence of dyslipidemia defined by LDL cholesterol in the SEARCH study.Data were collected from 502 adolescent patients with diabetes and analyzed. Non-HDL-C was calculated and levels were categorized into normal, borderline, and high based on the National Cholesterol Education Program.Lipid profile was performed in 370 patients, 92% of whom had type 1 diabetes. In the 339 subjects with type 1 diabetes, mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of those with normal non-HDL-C (8.6%) was significantly lower than the HbA1c of those with high non-HDL-C (9.6%) (P = .005). Subjects with normal non-HDL-C had a lower body mass index (BMI) z-score (0.4 ± 0.8) than the group with borderline and high non-HDL-C (0.75 ± 0.9%), P = .002. In the 31 subjects with type 2 diabetes, the mean HbA1c of those with normal non-HDL-C (8.1%) and those with borderline non-HDL-C (7.0%) was significantly lower than the mean HbA1c of those with high non-HDL-C (11.8%) (P = .04, and P = .009, respectively). In addition, the subjects with normal non-HDL-C had a lower BMI z-score (1.3 ± 1.3) than the group with borderline and high non-HDL-C (2.2 ± 0.6%), P = .03. The prevalence of dyslipidemia using non-HDL-C was similar to prevalence rates using LDL-C in the SEARCH study.In adolescents with diabetes, non-HDL-C is increased with poorer diabetes control and higher BMI. It appears to be a superior nonfasting lipid screening test for adolescents with diabetes that can be readily calculated on a randomly obtained rather than fasting sample.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636179","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"National Cholesterol Education Program","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cholesterol_Education_Program"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.847427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein","weight":0.785725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.740767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.709136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.671039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.383118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Hemoglobin A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin_A"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
