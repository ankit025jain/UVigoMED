{"id":73270,"title":"[Retrospective analysis of Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)].","abstract":"Owing to the advance of supportive care and the development of molecular targeted therapies, the elderlies or patients who have comorbidities have been treated more than before. The assessment of the comorbidity is indispensable to select the appropriate treatment or the control of following therapy. Some indices to determine them have been developed in western countries but not in Japan. The index which is used most is the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). This index has never been evaluated in Japan. So we investigated the utility of the index for Japanese population. We surveyed retrospectively 498 patients aged 65 or more patients with colon cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer that have been treated in our hospital during 2002-2007. According to CCI, patients are classified into three groups and verified 1-year and 3-year survival rate. 1-year survival rate was 76.9% in groups of 0 points, 83.5% in groups of1 -5 points, 75.0% in the group of six or more points respectively (p=0.19). 3-year survival rate were 59.0%, 63.1%, 75.0%, respectively (p=0.46). Multivariate analysis identified age (? 50), Sex (man), stage (III and IV) as significant predictors for worse OS at 3-year. However, there was no significant difference in CCI. There are some items which frequency is zero, so the items of CCI may not match to Japanese population. Presence of existing disease is an important factor for the cancer therapy, and it should be evaluated accurately. It is urgently necessary to develop an evaluation method and establish the scale.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917021","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.804011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.674475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.638188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.53624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.512701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.421892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.414057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.39465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.229301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.106265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.0697704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Western (genre)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"0 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"God","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"}]}
