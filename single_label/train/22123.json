{"id":22123,"title":"Passive protection of mice pups through oral or intranasal immunization of dams with recombinant Lactobacillus casei vaccine against ETEC F41.","abstract":"Mucosal immunization is advantageous over other routes of antigen delivery because it can induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses. In this study, we have developed fimbriae protein of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F41 was stably expressed on the surface Lactobacillus casei 525. The method of expressing vaccine antigens in L. casei induces both systemic and mucosal immunity after oral or intranasal administration. We demonstrate that an oral or intranasal vaccine based on live recombinant L. casei 525 protects infant mice from ETEC F41 infection. This platform technology can be applied to design oral or intranasal vaccine delivery vehicles against several microbial pathogens.
