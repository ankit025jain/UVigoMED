{"id":50883,"title":"The limit of detection in scintigraphic imaging with I-131 in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma.","abstract":"Radioiodine scintigraphy influences staging and treatment in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The limit of detection for fractional uptake in an iodine avid focus in a scintigraphic image was determined from the number of lesion net counts and the count density of the tissue background. The count statistics were used to calculate the diagnostic activity required to elevate the signal from a lesion with a given uptake significantly above a homogeneous background with randomly distributed counts per area. The dependences of the minimal uptake and the minimal size of lesions visible in a scan on several parameters of influence were determined by linking the typical biokinetics observed in iodine avid tissue to the lesion mass and to the absorbed dose received in a radioiodine therapy. The detection limits for fractional uptake in a neck lesion of a typical patient are about 0.001% after therapy with 7000 MBq, 0.01% for activities typically administered in diagnostic assessments (74-185 MBq), and 0.1% after the administration of 10 MBq I-131. Lesions at the limit of detection in a diagnostic scan with biokinetics eligible for radioiodine therapy are small with diameters of a few millimeters. Increasing the diagnostic activity by a factor of 4 reduces the diameter of visible lesions by 25% or about 1 mm. Several other determinants have a comparable or higher influence on the limit of detection than the administered activity; most important are the biokinetics in both blood pool and target tissue and the time of measurement. A generally valid recommendation for the timing of the scan is impossible as the time of the highest probability to detect iodine avid tissue depends on the administered activity as well as on the biokinetics in the lesion and background in the individual patient.
