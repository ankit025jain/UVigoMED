{"id":55745,"title":"A functional variant of PTPN22 confers risk for Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome but not for ankylosing spondylitis.","abstract":"Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 (PTPN22) is a key negative regulator of T lymphocytes and has emerged as an important candidate susceptibility factor for a number of immune-related diseases. This study aimed to examine the predisposition of PTPN22 SNPs to Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome and acute anterior uveitis (AAU) associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).A total of 1005 VKH syndrome, 302 AAU+AS+ patients and 2010 normal controls among the Chinese Han population were enrolled in the study. Genotyping, PTPN22 expression, cell proliferation, cytokine production and cell activation were examined by PCR-RFLP, Real-time PCR, CCK8, ELISA and Flow cytometry.The results showed significantly increased frequencies of the rs2488457 CC genotype and C allele but a decreased frequency of the GG genotype in VKH syndrome patients (PBonferroni correction (Pc)?=?3.47×10(-7), OR?=?1.54; Pc?=?3.83×10(-8), OR?=?1.40; Pc?=?6.35×10(-4), OR?=?0.62; respectively). No significant association of the tested SNPs with AAU+AS+ patients was observed. Functional studies showed a decreased PTPN22 expression, impaired cell proliferation and lower production of IL-10 in rs2488457 CC cases compared to GG cases (Pc?=?0.009, Pc?=?0.015 and Pc?=?0.048 respectively). No significant association was observed concerning T cell activation and rs2488457 genotype.The study showed that a functional variant of PTPN22 confers risk for VKH syndrome but not for AAU+AS+ in a Chinese Han population, which may be due to a modulation of the PTPN22 expression, PBMC proliferation and IL-10 production.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24816862","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.916233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.907729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.82342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ankylosing spondylitis","weight":0.765744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosing_spondylitis"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.637169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.62345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.599018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.369643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"China","weight":0.161032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Protein tyrosine phosphatase","weight":0.125785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_tyrosine_phosphatase"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Spondylitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylitis"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
