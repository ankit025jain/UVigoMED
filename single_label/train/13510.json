{"id":13510,"title":"Ultrasonic vocalizations during intermittent swim stress forecasts resilience in subsequent forced swim and spatial learning tests.","abstract":"The examination of stress resilience has substantially increased in recent years. However, current paradigms require multiple behavioral procedures, which themselves may serve as secondary stressors. Therefore, a novel predictor of stress resilience is needed to advance the field. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) have been observed as a behavioral correlate of stress in various rodent species. It was recently reported that rats that emitted ultrasonic vocalizations during intermittent swim stress (ISS) later showed resilience when tested on an instrumental swim escape test. In the current study, we extend this earlier observation on two additional behavioral endpoints. Rats were subjected to ISS, and USVs were recorded. Twenty-four hours later, behavioral performance was evaluated in either the forced swim test or Morris water maze. Rats that emitted ultrasonic vocalizations were resilient to the effects of ISS as indicated by performance similar to controls on both measures. These results extend the original findings that ISS-induced USVs are associated with resilience and are related to subsequent aversively motivated behavior. Such a non-invasive forecast of stress responsivity will allow future work to utilize USVs to examine the neural correlates of initial stress resistance/resilience, thereby eliminating potential confounds of further behavioral testing. Future studies can utilize USVs to target potentially unappreciated neural systems to provide novel pharmacotherapeutic strategies for treatment-resistant depression.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475493","annotations":[{"name":"Learning","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.485619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.416473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.41426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.414064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.370076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.289775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"International Space Station","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"},{"name":"Spatial memory","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_memory"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Responsivity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsivity"},{"name":"Morris water navigation task","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_water_navigation_task"},{"name":"Behavioural despair test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_despair_test"},{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Human swimming","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_swimming"},{"name":"Animal communication","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_communication"},{"name":"Maze","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze"},{"name":"Forecasting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting"},{"name":"Neural correlate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_correlate"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Stream","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Psychological resilience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience"}]}
