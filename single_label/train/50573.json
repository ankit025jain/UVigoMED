{"id":50573,"title":"Borderline ovarian tumors: outcomes of fertility sparing surgery.","abstract":"Borderline ovarian tumors(BOT) account for ten to 20 percent of all epitelial ovarian carcinomas and often occur in reproductive ages. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and reproductive outcomes of patients who were diagnosed with BOT and underwent fertility sparing surgery.Patients younger than 40 years who underwent fertility sparing surgery for BOT from 2004 to 2012 were reviewed retrospectively and were evaluated according to the reproductive and clinical outcomes.Twenty-eight patients younger than 40 years with BOT underwent fertility sparing surgery. Median follow up time was 42 +/- 28.1 months. During the follow up period, two patients (7.1%) developed recurrence at 35 and 36 months, respectively. Five (17.9%) out of 28 patients became pregnant during the follow up period.Fertility sparing surgery should be the first choice for the treatment of BOT in patients who wish to preserve fertility.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772918","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.733959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.723581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.611652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.151817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Build-operate-transfer","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build-operate-transfer"},{"name":"Reproductive success","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_success"}]}
