{"id":47097,"title":"[Features of population composition of peripheral blood CXCR3-positive lymphocytes in chronic viral hepatitis c patients].","abstract":"Quantitative determination ofCXCR3+, CCR5+ and CCR6+ cells in major lymphocyte populations: T-helpers (Th), cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL), natural killers (NK) and T-natural killer cells (TNK), B-lymphocytes in patients with chronic viral hepatitis C (CVHC).Content of lymphocyte populations carrying chemokine receptor CXCR3 was studied, chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR6 were evaluated on T-lymphocytes, in peripheral blood of 19 CVHC patients and 32 conditionally healthy donors. Cell populations were determined by flow cytofluorometry by using various combinations of monoclonal antibodies: for evaluation of Th and CTL (CD3/CD4/CD8/CXCR3/CCR5/CCR6); NK and TNK (CDl6/CD56/CD3/ CXCR3); B-cells (CD 19/CD45/CXCR3).In patients with CVHV compared with healthy donors a significant increase of quantity of CXCR3-positive Th was detected, however the content of CXCR3-positive CTL did not differ in the groups compared; CXCR3+ NK cell content was lower with equal content of CXCR3+ TNK. Analysis of quantity of CXCR3+ B-cells showed an increase of more than 3.5 times in CVHC patients. Significant differences in relative content of Th and CTL carrying CCR5 and CCR6 were not detected despite a non-significant increase of quantity of CCR5+ and CCR6+ Th.Content of major lymphocyte populations carrying chemokine receptor CXCR3 changed significantly compared with conditionally healthy donors in peripheral blood of CVHC patients. The increase of quantity of CXCR3-positive B-cells may be associated with infection of these cells by HCV or development of extra-liver manifestations of HVHC.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605678","annotations":[{"name":"Neural cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.890269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"CCR5","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCR5"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Chemokine receptor","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine_receptor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.787139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"PTPRC","weight":0.776898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPRC"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.765131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.743589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.711753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.639281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.392488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.391724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"CXC chemokine receptors","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"CC chemokine receptors","weight":0.176152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC_chemokine_receptors"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0539708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
