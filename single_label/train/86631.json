{"id":86631,"title":"Predicting risk of postoperative lung injury in high-risk surgical patients: a multicenter cohort study.","abstract":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a serious postoperative complication. Although ARDS prevention is a priority, the inability to identify patients at risk for ARDS remains a barrier to progress. The authors tested and refined the previously reported surgical lung injury prediction (SLIP) model in a multicenter cohort of at-risk surgical patients.This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter, prospective cohort investigation evaluating high-risk patients undergoing surgery. Preoperative ARDS risk factors and risk modifiers were evaluated for inclusion in a parsimonious risk-prediction model. Multiple imputation and domain analysis were used to facilitate development of a refined model, designated SLIP-2. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were used to assess model performance.Among 1,562 at-risk patients, ARDS developed in 117 (7.5%). Nine independent predictors of ARDS were identified: sepsis, high-risk aortic vascular surgery, high-risk cardiac surgery, emergency surgery, cirrhosis, admission location other than home, increased respiratory rate (20 to 29 and ?30 breaths/min), FIO2 greater than 35%, and SpO2 less than 95%. The original SLIP score performed poorly in this heterogeneous cohort with baseline risk factors for ARDS (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [95% CI], 0.56 [0.50 to 0.62]). In contrast, SLIP-2 score performed well (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [95% CI], 0.84 [0.81 to 0.88]). Internal validation indicated similar discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84.In this multicenter cohort of patients at risk for ARDS, the SLIP-2 score outperformed the original SLIP score. If validated in an independent sample, this tool may help identify surgical patients at high risk for ARDS.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755786","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.831647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.793623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.778612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.74653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Respiratory rate","weight":0.742258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_rate"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Vascular surgery","weight":0.684821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_surgery"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.636425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.599803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.435884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.373332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.299306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Occam's razor","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
