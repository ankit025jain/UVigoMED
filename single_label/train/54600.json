{"id":54600,"title":"Corneal astigmatism analysis for toric intraocular lens implantation: precise measurements for perfect correction.","abstract":"Corneal astigmatism is a common refractive error observed in a significant percentage of cataract patients. Accurate measurements of the preexisting corneal astigmatism are essential in order to achieve the desired refractive outcome after toric intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. This article presents a comprehensive review of recent published literatures on methods for measuring preoperative corneal astigmatism for toric IOL implantation.A variety of instruments has been introduced and used to measure the magnitude and meridian of corneal astigmatism during preoperative assessments of cataract patients. Instruments that consider both the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces as critical factors for measuring total corneal astigmatism are expected to provide better accuracy. Although these instruments facilitate improved evaluations of corneal astigmatism and have helped minimize postoperative residual astigmatism, a perfect method to analyze preoperative corneal astigmatism has not yet been established.Perfect correction of astigmatism after toric IOL implantation by using accurate corneal astigmatism values is the goal of this surgical procedure. To achieve this, correct and precise measurements of corneal astigmatism to determine the magnitude and meridian should be obtained.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25415298","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.682266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.645103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.590836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.365278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.31105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.227124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Meridian (geography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(geography)"},{"name":"Perfect (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(grammar)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Toric lens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_lens"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
