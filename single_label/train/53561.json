{"id":53561,"title":"Profile of the obese patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass whithout diabetes melittus type 2 remission and/or insufficient weight loss.","abstract":"The literature reports that gastrojejunal derivation with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is highly efficient in controlling weight and resolving; but studies have shown worsened glycemic control in a considerable number of patients and associated factors that have not been fully elucidated.To analyze the profile of patients submitted to gastric bypass that did not achieve satisfactory weight loss or complete diabetes remission.Case-control study of 32 patients submitted to gastric bypass with at least two years postoperative time, unsatisfactory results in terms of weight loss or absence of complete diabetes remission. The control group was composed of another 32 patients submitted to the same operation at the same facility, matched for age and postoperative time. A structured questionnaire was applied and clinical and laboratory data were analyzed.Among the cases and controls, BMI was 38.9 kg/mÂ² and 29.5 kg/m2, excess weight loss was 56.1% and 77.2%, % excess weight regain of initial excess weight loss, was 20.2% and 7.7%, respectively. Family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and food intolerance showed a significant relationship between cases and controls.Food intolerance and family history of hypertension and diabetes were associated to lower loss and weight regain or less likelihood of complete diabetes remission after gastric bypass.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510042","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.654689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Gastric bypass surgery","weight":0.610261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.487257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.437035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Food intolerance","weight":0.413485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_intolerance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.297191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0808391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Etymology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
