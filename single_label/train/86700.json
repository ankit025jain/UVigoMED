{"id":86700,"title":"[Anaesthesia for patients with obstructive airway diseases].","abstract":"Obstructive lung diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive lung diseases have a high prevalence and are one of the four most frequent causes of death. Obstructive lung diseases can be significantly influenced by the choice of anesthetic techniques and anesthetic agents. Basically, the severity of the COPD and the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity will determine the perioperative anesthetic risk. This risk has to be assessed by a thorough preoperative evaluation and will give the rationale on which to decide for the adequate anaesthetic technique. In particular, airway instrumentation can cause severe reflex bronchoconstriction. The use of regional anaesthesia alone or in combination with general anaesthesia can help to avoid airway irritation and leads to reduced postoperative complications. Prophylactic antiobstructive treatment, volatile anesthetics, propofol, opioids, and an adequate choice of muscle relaxants minimize the anesthetic risk, when general anesthesia is required In case, despite all precautions intra-operative bronchospasm occurs, deepening of anaesthesia, repeated administration of beta2-adrenergic agents and parasympatholytics, and a single systemic dose of corticosteroids represent the main treatment options.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749300","annotations":[{"name":"Bronchospasm","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchospasm"},{"name":"Propofol","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Inhalational anaesthetic","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalational_anaesthetic"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Muscle relaxant","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxant"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.75769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.737608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Regional anaesthesia","weight":0.621806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.564861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bronchoconstriction","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoconstriction"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.273912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Parasympatholytic","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympatholytic"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0258547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Beta decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Volatility (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"}]}
