{"id":38381,"title":"Treatment of low bone density in young people with cystic fibrosis: a multicentre, prospective, open-label observational study of calcium and calcifediol followed by a randomised placebo-controlled trial of alendronate.","abstract":"Long-term complications of cystic fibrosis include osteoporosis and fragility fractures, but few data are available about effective treatment strategies, especially in young patients. We investigated treatment of low bone mineral density in children, adolescents, and young adults with cystic fibrosis.We screened 540 patients and enrolled 171 (mean age 13·8 years, SD 5·9, range 5-30). In the observational phase, treatment with calcium and calcifediol increased bone mineral apparent density by 5% or more in 43 patients (25%). 128 patients entered the randomised phase. Bone mineral apparent density increased by 16·3% in the alendronate group (n=65) versus 3·1% in the placebo group (n=63; p=0·0010). 19 of 57 young people (33·3%) receiving alendronate attained a normal-for-age bone mineral apparent density Z score. In the observational phase, five patients had moderate episodes of hypercalciuria, which resolved after short interruption of calcifediol treatment. During the randomised phase, one patient taking alendronate had mild fever versus none in the placebo group; treatment groups did not differ significantly for other adverse events.Correct calcium intake plus calcifediol can improve bone mineral density in some young patients with cystic fibrosis. In those who do not respond to calcium and calcifediol alone, alendronate can safely and effectively increase bone mineral density.Telethon Foundation (Italy).","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24429202","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.833162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.803216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.747018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.687869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.550214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Hypercalciuria","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercalciuria"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.408346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.358524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Alendronic acid","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alendronic_acid"},{"name":"Calcifediol","weight":0.348478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcifediol"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.322908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.296457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.244756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.180332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Pathologic fracture","weight":0.0775456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Telethon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telethon"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Area code 530","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_530"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"}]}
