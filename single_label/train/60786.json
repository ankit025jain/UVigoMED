{"id":60786,"title":"Narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy for mycosis fungoides in children.","abstract":"Mycosis fungoides (MF), the commonest form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is uncommon in childhood. Phototherapy is a common treatment for MF.To retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of narrow band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy for the treatment of MF n children.We performed a retrospective analysis of children of East Asian descent with a clinical and histological diagnosis of MF, who were treated with NB-UVB phototherapy at the National Skin Centre, Singapore over the 5-year period 2004-2008.We identified nine suitable patients (eight boys, one girl; age range 5-12 years). Mean time from disease onset to diagnosis was 21 months (range 4 months to 3 years). There were two patients with stage 1A disease, six with stage 1B disease and one with stage 2A disease. Body surface area involvement ranged from 10% to 60%, and none of the patients had systemic involvement. Eight patients attained complete response after phototherapy, but only three had sustained remission after a follow-up of 1-3 years. Five patients had recurrence of lesions after an mean of 13.8 months (range 4-36). Treatment was well tolerated.Phototherapy using NB-UVB in the treatment of MF is efficacious and safe. We recommend it as first-line treatment in the management of early-stage MF in children.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825139","annotations":[{"name":"Mycosis fungoides","weight":0.909265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis_fungoides"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.829553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Light therapy","weight":0.783537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.628281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.615269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Singapore","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.148516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Narrowband","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband"},{"name":"Body surface area","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_surface_area"},{"name":"National Skin Centre","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Skin_Centre"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Surface area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Centre (French region)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(French_region)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Midfielder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"},{"name":"First baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Minuscule 436","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_436"}]}
