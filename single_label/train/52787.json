{"id":52787,"title":"Association of lichen planopilaris with thyroid disease: a retrospective case-control study.","abstract":"Studies on the precise causes and comorbidities seen with lichen planopilaris (LPP) are limited.We sought to determine the prevalence of thyroid diseases in patients with LPP.Medical records of 166 patients with LPP and 81 age- and gender-matched control subjects seen in the Department of Dermatology at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio between 2000 and 2013 were reviewed.A diagnosis of thyroid disease was present in 34% (n = 57) of the 166 patients with LPP, and in 11% (n = 9) of the control subjects (P = .0001). When confined to hypothyroidism only, this disease was found in 29% (n = 48) of the patients with LPP and 9% (n = 7) of the control subjects (P = .0003).This study was limited by being retrospective.In our patients, LPP was associated with thyroid disease, especially hypothyroidism.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24569115","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.857284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.584962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.508194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Thyroid disease","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.399276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.398019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cleveland","weight":0.110913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland"},{"name":"Ohio","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Lichen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen"},{"name":"Lichen planopilaris","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen_planopilaris"},{"name":"Cleveland Clinic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Latvia's First Party","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia's_First_Party"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"}]}
