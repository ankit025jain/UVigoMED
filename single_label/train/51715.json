{"id":51715,"title":"Relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to determine a correlation between the level of 25-hydroxivitamin D (25-OHD) and the incidence of diabetes.In this prospective observational study, 97 (out of an initial 100) Caucasian women with osteoporosis (OS) were monitored for 2 years for the incidence of diabetes. Logistic regression analysis was used to establish an association with and prognostic value of vitamin D for the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as insulin resistance, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the development of diabetes. The serum level of 25-OHD was measured using immunochemiluminescence in March and April 2011.Of the 97 patients (mean age 51.64 Â± 5.86 years, range 36.0-73.0), 21 (21.65%) were diagnosed with diabetes during the observational period. The study showed that the 22 patients with low levels of vitamin D were more susceptible to diabetes (odds ratio = 0.958). The cut-off value of vitamin D using a receiver operating characteristic curve was 62.36 nmol/l with a sensitivity of 39.5% and a specificity of 90.5%. With an increase in BMI and triglyceride levels, women were, respectively, 1,591 and 2,821 times more likely to get diabetes than those without an increase.This study showed that the patients with postmenopausal OS and hypovitaminosis D, besides a high BMI, elevated triglyceride levels and insulin resistance, had an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24662713","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.900593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.886823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.883109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.671246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.668965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.645714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.427876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.370755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.244695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.159271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"}]}
