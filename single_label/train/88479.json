{"id":88479,"title":"Additional injuries in young infants with concern for abuse and apparently isolated bruises.","abstract":"To determine the prevalence of additional injuries or bleeding disorders in a large population of young infants evaluated for abuse because of apparently isolated bruising.This was a prospectively planned secondary analysis of an observational study of children<10 years (120 months) of age evaluated for possible physical abuse by 20 US child abuse teams. This analysis included infants<6 months of age with apparently isolated bruising who underwent diagnostic testing for additional injuries or bleeding disorders.Among 2890 children, 33.9% (980/2890) were <6 months old, and 25.9% (254/980) of these had bruises identified. Within this group, 57.5% (146/254) had apparently isolated bruises at presentation. Skeletal surveys identified new injury in 23.3% (34/146), neuroimaging identified new injury in 27.4% (40/146), and abdominal injury was identified in 2.7% (4/146). Overall, 50% (73/146) had at least one additional serious injury. Although testing for bleeding disorders was performed in 70.5% (103/146), no bleeding disorders were identified. Ultimately, 50% (73/146) had a high perceived likelihood of abuse.Infants younger than 6 months of age with bruising prompting subspecialty consultation for abuse have a high risk of additional serious injuries. Routine medical evaluation for young infants with bruises and concern for physical abuse should include physical examination, skeletal survey, neuroimaging, and abdominal injury screening.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24840754","annotations":[{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.710292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.686347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.6267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.572465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.435884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.423723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Physical abuse","weight":0.405809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_abuse"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.287497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.2704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.262149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.20395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Coagulopathy","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Abdominal trauma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_trauma"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
