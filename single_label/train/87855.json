{"id":87855,"title":"Techniques for the surgical treatment of distal tibia fractures.","abstract":"Surgical management of extra-articular distal tibia fractures has evolved because of the high rate of complications with conventional techniques and the technically challenging aspects of the surgery. Open reduction and internal fixation with plating or nailing remain the gold standards of treatment, and minimally invasive techniques have reduced wound complications and increased healing. Adequate reduction and stabilization as well as appropriate soft tissue management are imperative to achieving good outcomes in these fractures.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975759","annotations":[{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.839817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.714726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.49833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.436161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.323583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.231498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0591548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Imperative mood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood"},{"name":"Envelope detector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_detector"},{"name":"Plating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Lower extremity of tibia","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_tibia"}]}
