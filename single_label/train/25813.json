{"id":25813,"title":"Suboptimal risk factor control in patients undergoing elective coronary or peripheral percutaneous intervention.","abstract":"The American Heart Association recommends targeting 7 cardiovascular (CV) health metrics to reduce morbidity and mortality. Control of these targets in patients undergoing CV intervention is uncertain.We prospectively studied patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary or peripheral intervention from November 2010 to May 2012. We recorded data on patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and social history. Risk factor control was categorized as ideal, intermediate, or poor according to the 7 American Heart Association-defined CV health metrics (smoking status, body mass index, physical activity, diet, cholesterol, blood pressure, and metabolic control). Linear regression model was used to evaluate the association between baseline characteristics and poor CV health.Among 830 consecutive patients enrolled, mean age is 67.3 ± 10.8 years, 74.2% are male, and 62.1% are white. The adequacy of achievement of ideal CV health is suboptimal in our cohort; the mean number of ideal CV metrics is 2.15 ± 1.06. Less than 1 in 10 (9.7%) met ?4 ideal CV health metrics. After multivariate analysis, male sex (P = .04), nonwhite race (P = .01), prior coronary artery disease (P < .01), prior peripheral arterial disease (P < .01), and history of depression (P = .01) were significantly associated with poor CV health.Among patients referred for elective CV intervention, achievement of ideal CV health is poor. Elective interventions represent an opportunity to identify and target CV health for risk factor control and secondary prevention.","date":"2014-09-01","categories":"Cardiovascular
