{"id":37871,"title":"Utilizing multiple in silico analyses to identify putative causal SCN5A variants in Brugada syndrome.","abstract":"Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inheritable sudden cardiac death disease mainly caused by SCN5A mutations. Traditional approaches can be costly and time-consuming if all candidate variants need to be validated through in vitro studies. Therefore, we developed a new approach by combining multiple in silico analyses to predict functional and structural changes of candidate SCN5A variants in BrS before conducting in vitro studies. Five SCN5A non-synonymous variants (1651G>A, 1776C>G, 1673A>G, 3269C>T and 3578G>A) were identified in 14 BrS patients using direct DNA sequencing. Several bioinformatics algorithms were applied and predicted that 1651G>A (A551T) and 1776C>G (N592K) were high-risk SCN5A variants (odds ratio 59.59 and 23.93). The results were validated by Mass spectrometry and in vitro electrophysiological assays. We concluded that integrating sequence-based information and secondary protein structures elements may help select highly potential variants in BrS before conducting time-consuming electrophysiological studies and two novel SCN5A mutations were validated.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463578","annotations":[{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.83179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"In silico","weight":0.825742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.71709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.689984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.653735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.620621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.559514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.368031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.276273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.141683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Missense mutation","weight":0.0813771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mutation"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Brugada syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugada_syndrome"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0256615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Genetic algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
