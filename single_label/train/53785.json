{"id":53785,"title":"Hypogonadism in aged hospitalized male patients: prevalence and clinical outcome.","abstract":"Male hypogonadism is common in the elderly and has been associated with increased risk of mortality. Our objective has been to assess the prevalence of primary and central hypogonadism in elderly male patients admitted to the hospital because of acute illness. We also evaluated the relationships between gonadal dysfunction and in-hospital mortality.150 patients, aged ?65 years, admitted during 2010 and 2011 in our geriatric unit, were studied. Serum concentrations total, bioavailable and free testosterone, as well as of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone were quantified in every patient. Hypogonadism was defined by the presence of serum testosterone levels lower than 200 ng/dl.Hypogonadism was found in 80 patients (53.3 %). Serum gonadotropin concentrations were elevated in 43.7 % of these patients, whereas 41.3 % of hypogonadic patients showed normal and 15 % low gonadotropin concentrations. Respiratory tract infection and congestive heart failure were the main causes of hospitalization in hypogonadal men, whereas acute cerebrovascular disease was the main reason for admission in eugonadal patients. Of the 13 patients who died during hospitalization, 12 were hypogonadic. Patients who died showed significantly lower serum levels of total, free and bioavailable testosterone than those found in patients who survived.Our results show that about half of patients admitted for acute illness have hypogonadism, mainly of non-hypergonadotropic type. Gonadal hypofunction is significantly related with in-hospital mortality. A low value of serum testosterone may be a predictor for mortality in elderly male patients.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24497212","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.875921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.720698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.702836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.627403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.62146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Gonad","weight":0.604766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonad"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.549832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.536003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Bioavailability","weight":0.416275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.401224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.394121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.304947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"}]}
