{"id":87678,"title":"[Case-control study on the modified ilioinguinal incision of anterior approach for the treatment of pelvic and acetabular fractures].","abstract":"To study modified ilioinguinal approach through the retrospective analysis on the surgical treatment of 63 patients with pelvic and acetabular fractures through anterior approach.From January 2006 to January 2013, 63 patients with pelvic and acetabular fractures were treated with the ilioinguinal anterior approach, including 45 males and 18 females, ranging in age from 12 to 68 years old, with an average of (37.71 +/- 13.41) years old. All the patients were divided into two groups: standard ilioinguinal anterior approach group (group A) and modified ilioinguinal anterior approach group(group B). In group A, there were 26 males and 11 females, with an average age of (38.49 +/- 13.64) years old. In group B, there were 19 males and 7 females, with an average age of (36.62 +/- 13.29) years old. Intraoperative and postoperative indicators in group A and B were observed and compared, including operation incision exposure time (from skin incision to complete the ilioinguinal in front of three \"windows\"), the blood loss, incision close time and treatment effect of Majeed function score.Compared to group A, the incision exposure time of patients in group B was shorter, the blood loss (bleeding during exposure process) was less, and the close incision time was shorter, but the treatment effect of Majeed function score had no significant differences between two groups. All the patients were followed up, and the during ranged from 3 to 36 months, with an average of (18.6 +/- 9.2) months. According to Matta standard assessment reduction of pelvic and acetabular fracture, there were 28 patients got an excellent result, 8 good, and 1 fair in the group A; and 20 patients got an excellent result, 5 good, and 1 fair in the group B. According to Majeed function score for hip function, 20 patients got a satisfactory result, 12 good,4 fair and 1 poor in group A, and the mean score was 82.51 +/- 9.72; and 13 patients got an satisfactory result, 10 good, 3 fair and 0 poor in group B, and the mean score was 80.54 +/- 10.79.The modified approach has several advantages as follows: providing a good surgical exposure; preventing from the injury of femoral nerve, femoral artery and vein under the inguinal ligament; not needing to open the inguinal canal, which can avoid the occurrence of inguinal hernia, reduce operation prodedures and shorten operation time.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029845","annotations":[{"name":"Inguinal hernia","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_hernia"},{"name":"Inguinal ligament","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_ligament"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Inguinal canal","weight":0.80179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_canal"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Femoral artery","weight":0.757152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_artery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.703722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.490218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.395274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.31955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Femoral nerve","weight":0.308908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_nerve"},{"name":"Ilioinguinal nerve","weight":0.208715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilioinguinal_nerve"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.154924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.0679159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Reduction (orthopedic surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(orthopedic_surgery)"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"}]}
