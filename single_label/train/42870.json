{"id":42870,"title":"Molecular mechanisms of oncogene-induced inflammation and inflammation-sustained oncogene activation in gastrointestinal tumors: an under-appreciated symbiotic relationship.","abstract":"Inflammation plays an integral part in tumor initiation. Specifically, patients with colitis, pancreatitis, or hepatitis have an increased susceptibility to cancer. The activation, mutation, and overexpression of oncogenes have been well documented in cell proliferation and transformation. Recently, oncogenes were found to also regulate the inflammatory milieu in tumors. Similarly, the inflammatory milieu can promote oncogene activation. In this review, we summarize advances of the symbiotic relationship oncogene activation and inflammation in gastrointestinal tumors such as colorectal, hepatic, and pancreatic tumors. NF-?B and STAT3 are the two most common pathways that are deregulated via these oncogenes. Understanding these interactions may yield effective therapeutic strategies for tumor prevention and treatment.
