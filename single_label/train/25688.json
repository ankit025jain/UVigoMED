{"id":25688,"title":"Adaptation of trustworthy guidelines developed using the GRADE methodology: a novel five-step process.","abstract":"Adaptation of guidelines for use at the national or local level can facilitate their implementation. We developed and evaluated an adaptation process in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, aiming for efficiency and transparency. This article is the first in a series describing our adaptation of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines for a Norwegian setting.Informed by the ADAPTE framework, we developed a five-step adaptation process customized to guidelines developed using GRADE: (1) planning, (2) initial assessment of the recommendations, (3) modification, (4) publication, and (5) evaluation. We developed a taxonomy for describing how and why recommendations from the parent guideline were modified and applied a mixed-methods case study design for evaluation of the process.We published the adapted guideline in November 2013 in a novel multilayered format. The taxonomy for adaptation facilitated transparency of the modification process for both the guideline developers and the end users. We excluded 30 and modified 131 of the 333 original recommendations according to the taxonomy and developed eight new recommendations. Unforeseen obstacles related to acquiring a licensing agreement and procuring a publisher resulted in a 9-month delay. We propose modifications of the adaptation process to overcome these obstacles in the future.This case study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel guideline adaptation process. Replication is needed to further validate the usefulness of the process in increasing the organizational and methodologic efficiency of guideline adaptation.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25180723","annotations":[{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.497498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.398527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.390396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"License","weight":0.375049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.336713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Norway","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.124674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.109465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Publishing","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Software developer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer"},{"name":"American College of Chest Physicians","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Chest_Physicians"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0293966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"File format","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"End-user","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user"},{"name":"Transparency (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)"},{"name":"Procurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"},{"name":"Antithrombotic","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antithrombotic"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
