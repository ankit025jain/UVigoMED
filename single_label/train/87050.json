{"id":87050,"title":"Use of the 5' untranslated region and VP1 region to examine the molecular diversity in enterovirus B species.","abstract":"Human enteroviruses evolve quickly. The 5' untranslated region (UTR) is fundamentally important for efficient viral replication and for virulence; the VP1 region correlates well with antigenic typing by neutralization, and can be used for virus identification and evolutionary studies. In order to investigate the molecular diversity in EV-B species, the 5' UTR and VP1 regions were analysed for 208 clinical isolates from a single public-health laboratory (serving New South Wales, Australia), representing 28 EV-B types. Sequences were compared with the 5' UTR and VP1 regions of 98 strains available in GenBank, representing the same 28 types. The genetic relationships were analysed using two types of software (mega and BioNumerics). The sequence analyses of the 5' UTR and VP1 regions of 306 EV-B strains demonstrated that: (i) comparing the two regions gives strong evidence of epidemiological linkage of strains in some serotypes; (ii) the intraserotypic genetic variation within each gene reveals that they evolve distinctly largely due to their different functions; and (iii) mutation and possible recombination in the two regions play significant roles in the molecular diversity of EV-B. Understanding the tempo and pattern of molecular diversity and evolution is of great importance in the pathogenesis of EV-B enteroviruses, information which will assist in disease prevention and control.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Virus
