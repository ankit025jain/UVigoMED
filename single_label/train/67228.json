{"id":67228,"title":"Dose selection method for pharmacokinetic study in hemodialysis patients using a subpharmacological dose: oseltamivir as a model drug.","abstract":"Dose selection is an important step in pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of hemodialysis patients. We propose a simulation-based dose-selection method for PK studies of hemodialysis patients using a subpharmacological dose of oseltamivir as a model drug.The concentrations of oseltamivir and its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. To determine a low oseltamivir dose exhibiting PK linearity, a pilot low dose determination investigation (n = 4) was performed using a single administration dose-escalation study. After the dose was determined, a low dose study (n = 10) was performed, and the optimal dose required to reach the hypothetical target OC exposure (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] of 60,000 ng Â· hr/mL) was simulated using a nonparametric superposition method. Finally, observed PKs at the optimal dose were compared to the simulated PKs to verify PK predictability.In the pilot low dose determination study, 2.5 mg of oseltamivir was determined to be the low dose. Subsequently, we performed a single-dose PK study with the low oseltamivir dose in an additional group of 10 hemodialysis patients. The predicted AUC last of OC following continuous oseltamivir doses was simulated, and 35 mg of oseltamivir corresponded to the hypothetical target AUC last of OC. The observed PK profiles of OC at a 35-mg oseltamivir dose and the simulated data based on the low dose study were in close alignment.The results indicate that the proposed method provides a rational approach to determine the proper PK dose in hemodialysis patients.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636040","annotations":[{"name":"Integral","weight":0.766033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.473382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.374545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.322678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.224688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.129536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Carboxylic acid","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxylic_acid"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Oseltamivir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Selection methods","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_methods"},{"name":"Rational number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number"},{"name":"Non-parametric statistics","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Predictability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictability"},{"name":"Superposition principle","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle"}]}
