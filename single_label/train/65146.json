{"id":65146,"title":"Detection of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene in benign prostatic hyperplasia.","abstract":"The Ets-related gene fusions are among the most common molecular alterations in prostate cancer (PCa) and are detected in more than 50 % of PCas. Transmembrane protease serine 2 and Ets-related gene fusion (TMPRSS2-ERG) is the most frequently identified chimeric gene and has been associated with undifferentiated and invasive phenotypes. TMPRSS2-ERG has also been detected in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions and more rarely in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) regions mainly in PCa-bearing glands. The possibility that the fusion TMPRSS2-ERG may be present in BPH samples in the absence of apparent PCa was addressed. Out of 115 BPH samples, three were found positive employing RT-PCR. The presence of the fusion gene was confirmed by FISH for these samples, and an additional four samples were found to carry the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion out of 43 tested by the later approach. The presence of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion did not result in altered expression of 12 putative downstream targets. These findings indicate that TMPRSS2-ERG may or may not lead to PCa development.","date":"2014-10-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24961351","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Fusion gene","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_gene"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.818972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.789555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.762792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Transmembrane protein","weight":0.74799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_protein"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.730257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.626216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.492413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"TMPRSS2","weight":0.358625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMPRSS2"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.204334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.143873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Personal identification number","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identification_number"},{"name":"ERG (gene)","weight":0.0148293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERG_(gene)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Fusion (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_(music)"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
