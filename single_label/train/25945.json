{"id":25945,"title":"[Thrombolytic agents].","abstract":"Thrombolytic agents positively resolve existing thrombi by accelerating the activity of plasmin, a key enzyme of the fibrinolytic pathway. The main drug in use is a plasminogen activator (PA) which degrades plasminogen to plasmin. PA is classified into urokinase-type (u-PA) and tissue-type (t-PA). Because t-PA more selectively activates plasmin onto the surface of thrombi, it induces less in terms of systemic hemorrhagic complications. Beside the main effects, some articles have reported that t-PA causes damage to blood brain barrier structures and has a level of neuron toxicity. With this, delayed administration of t-PA for acute ischemic stroke may accelerate ischemic damage of brain tissue. In circulating blood, plasmin itself is rapidly inactivated by a plasmin-inhibitor, so with this, intra-arterial administration of plasmin directly near thrombi site is currently under investigation.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163317","annotations":[{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Blood-brain barrier","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-brain_barrier"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.796942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.762097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Human brain","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.64303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Tissue plasminogen activator","weight":0.603049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.562729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Thrombolysis","weight":0.437219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombolysis"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.431077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.201595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Urokinase","weight":0.027094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urokinase"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"}]}
