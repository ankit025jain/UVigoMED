{"id":37143,"title":"Atrial fibrillation in a large population with Brugada electrocardiographic pattern: prevalence, management, and correlation with prognosis.","abstract":"A high prevalence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFl) has been reported in small series of Brugada patients, with discordant data.The purpose of this study was to analyze, in a large population of Brugada patients, the prevalence of AF/AFl, its correlation with prognosis, and the efficacy of hydroquinidine (HQ) treatment.Among 560 patients with Brugada type 1 ECG (BrECG), 48 (9%) had AF/AFl. Three groups were considered: 23 patients with BrECG pattern recognized before AF/AFl (group 1); 25 patients first diagnosed with AF/AFl in whom Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs administered for cardioversion/prophylaxis unmasked BrECG (group 2); and 512 patients without AF/AFl (group 3). Recurrence of AF/AFl and occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias were evaluated at follow-up.Mean age was 47 ± 15 years, 59 ± 11 years, and 44 ± 14 years in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Seven subjects (32%) in group 1 had syncope/aborted sudden death, 1 (4%) in group 2, and 122 (24%) in group 3. Ventricular arrhythmia occurred in three patients in group 1, none in group 2, and 10 in group 3 at median follow-up of 51, 68, and 41 months, respectively. Nine patients in group 1 and nine in group 2 received HQ for AF/AFl prophylaxis; on therapy, none had AF/AFl recurrence.Prevalence of AF/AFl in Brugada patients is higher than in the general population of the same age. Patients in group 1 are younger than those in group 2 and have a worse prognosis compared to both groups 2 and 3. HQ therapy has proved useful and safe in patients with AF/AFl and BrECG.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513919","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.621313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.572774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Atrial fibrillation","weight":0.447393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.421785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.380041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Antiarrhythmic agent","weight":0.314997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiarrhythmic_agent"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.212873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Fibrillation","weight":0.0463236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrillation"},{"name":"Brugada syndrome","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugada_syndrome"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"560","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/560"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Discordant","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordant"},{"name":"Atrial flutter","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_flutter"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0140385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"}]}
