{"id":50578,"title":"Chorea as a rare manifestation of hyperglycaemia.","abstract":"We present a case of chorea presenting as a clinical manifestation of hyperglycaemia.The purpose of presenting this case is to highlight the fact that movement disorder may be the clinical presentation of hyperglycaemia and it reverts on treatment of hyperglycaemia.A 66-year-old female known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus and on oral hypoglycaemic drugs presented with abnormal and involuntary movements of the whole body and face since 7 days and high plasma glucose (446 mg/dl) and without ketosis. On controlling the blood sugar, there has been significant decrease in choreiform movements within 48 hrs and complete resolution of involuntary movements found at discharge at 1 week.Movement disorder like chorea may be the clinical presentation of the hyperglycaemia which could completely recover on rapid detection and correction of hyperglycaemia.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772709","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Ketosis","weight":0.83581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.832852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Movement disorder","weight":0.748396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_disorder"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.626571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Choreia (disease)","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choreia_(disease)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"446","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/446"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Movement (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music)"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 66","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_66"}]}
