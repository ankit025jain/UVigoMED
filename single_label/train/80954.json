During the follow-up of 6-72 months, no esophageal and gastric varices were found.Splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization is effective in the treatment of advanced schistosomiasis with cavernous transformation of the portal vein.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490407","annotations":[{"name":"Splenectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenectomy"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.818371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Esophageal varices","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_varices"},{"name":"Upper gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Gastric varices","weight":0.705736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_varices"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal bleeding","weight":0.625913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_bleeding"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.519125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Varices","weight":0.339165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varices"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.0798632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hunan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan"},{"name":"Malignant transformation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_transformation"},{"name":"Cavernous sinus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavernous_sinus"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
