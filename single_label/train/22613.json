{"id":22613,"title":"Cost-effectiveness of a potential group B streptococcal vaccine program for pregnant women in South Africa.","abstract":"In low- and middle-income countries neonatal infections are important causes of infant mortality. Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a major pathogen. A GBS polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine, the only option that has the potential to prevent both early- and late-onset GBS disease, has completed Phase II trials. Screening-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for pregnant women, an effective strategy in high-income countries, is often not practical in these settings. Risk factor-based IAP (RFB-IAP) for women with risk factors at delivery has had limited success in preventing neonatal infection. We evaluated the cost and health impacts of maternal GBS vaccination in South Africa.We developed a decision-analytic model for an annual cohort of pregnant women that simulates the natural history of GBS disease in their infants. We compared four strategies: doing nothing, maternal GBS vaccination, RFB-IAP, and vaccination plus RFB-IAP. Assuming vaccine efficacy varies from 50% to 90% against covered serotypes and 75% of pregnant women are vaccinated, GBS vaccination alone prevents 30-54% of infant GBS cases compared to doing nothing. For vaccine prices between $10 and $30, and mid-range efficacy, its cost ranges from $676 to $2390 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted ($US 2010), compared to doing nothing. RFB-IAP alone, compared to doing nothing, prevents 10% of infant GBS cases at a cost of $240/DALY. Vaccine plus RFB-IAP prevents 48% of cases at a cost of $664-2128/DALY.Vaccination would substantially reduce the burden of infant GBS disease in South Africa and would be very cost-effective by WHO guidelines. RFB-IAP is also very cost-effective, but prevents only 10% of cases. Vaccination plus RFB-IAP is more effective and more costly than vaccination alone, and consistently very cost-effective.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530145","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Disability-adjusted life year","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Streptococcus agalactiae","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_agalactiae"},{"name":"Infant mortality","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.786108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.779139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.652236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.496785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.346804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.28053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.164981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.151871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0995937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"}]}
