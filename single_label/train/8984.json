{"id":8984,"title":"Critical role of TNF-? in cerebral aneurysm formation and progression to rupture.","abstract":"Alterations in TNF-? expression have been associated with cerebral aneurysms, but a direct role in formation, progression, and rupture has not been established.Cerebral aneurysms were induced through hypertension and a single stereotactic injection of elastase into the basal cistern in mice. To test the role of TNF-? in aneurysm formation, aneurysms were induced in TNF-? knockout mice and mice pretreated with the synthesized TNF-? inhibitor 3,6'dithiothalidomide (DTH). To assess the role of TNF-? in aneurysm progression and rupture, DTH was started 6 days after aneurysm induction. TNF-? expression was assessed through real-time PCR and immunofluorescence staining.TNF-? knockout mice and those pre-treated with DTH had significantly decreased incidence of aneurysm formation and rupture as compared to sham mice. As compared with sham mice, TNF-? protein and mRNA expression was not significantly different in TNF-? knockout mice or those pre-treated with DTH, but was elevated in unruptured and furthermore in ruptured aneurysms. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) occurred between 7 and 21 days following aneurysm induction. To ensure aneurysm formation preceded rupture, additional mice underwent induction and sacrifice after 7 days. Seventy-five percent had aneurysm formation without evidence of SAH. Initiation of DTH treatment 6 days after aneurysm induction did not alter the incidence of aneurysm formation, but resulted in aneurysmal stabilization and a significant decrease in rupture.These data suggest a critical role of TNF-? in the formation and rupture of aneurysms in a model of cerebral aneurysm formation. Inhibitors of TNF-? could be beneficial in preventing aneurysmal progression and rupture.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24739142","annotations":[{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Subarachnoid hemorrhage","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.666115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.643326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.612956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.449409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.382358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.288404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.135682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Subarachnoid space","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_space"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.080992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Cerebral aneurysm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_aneurysm"},{"name":"Elastase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastase"},{"name":"Cistern","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistern"},{"name":"TNF inhibitor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNF_inhibitor"},{"name":"Direct-broadcast satellite","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-broadcast_satellite"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Sacrifice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
