{"id":80440,"title":"[Isolated gluteal hydatid cyst].","abstract":"Hydatid cyst disease is a parasitic infection caused by Echinococcus granulosus and poses a serious health problem in endemic areas, including our country. Hydatid disease mostly affects the liver and lung, although involvements in many parts of the body have been reported in the literature. Isolated soft tissue involvement is very rare. We present an isolated hydatid disease case which affected the gluteal region of the body.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659703","annotations":[{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.72151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.559674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Parasitic disease","weight":0.445995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_disease"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.208685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Echinococcus granulosus","weight":0.188889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus_granulosus"},{"name":"Buttocks","weight":0.186544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Echinococcus","weight":0.0388889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
