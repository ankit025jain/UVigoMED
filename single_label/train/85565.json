{"id":85565,"title":"Umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol in combination for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","abstract":"Drugs from the two major classes of bronchodilator; umeclidinium, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and vilanterol, a long-acting ?2 agonist (LABA), have been combined in a single inhaler device for once-daily use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These drugs have been proven safe and well tolerated in patients with COPD and show an enhanced improvement in FEV1 when compared to either drug in isolation and when compared with an established LAMA drug. In this article, we discuss the data supporting this combination inhaler and also review alternative combined LAMA/LABA options. We discuss where these agents are likely to find a place in the current therapy of COPD and where the future is likely to lead with these and other therapies.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24909949","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Bronchodilator","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchodilator"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.776157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Muscarinic antagonist","weight":0.718575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_antagonist"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.682034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.369202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.200444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Inhaler","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhaler"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.0266347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-acting_beta-adrenoceptor_agonist"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Bromide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide"}]}
