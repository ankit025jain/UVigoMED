{"id":68568,"title":"Serum microRNAs as biomarkers in patients undergoing prostate biopsy: results from a prospective multi-center study.","abstract":"Increased levels of microRNAs in serum/plasma have been identified in various malignancies. We aimed to investigate serum levels of miR-26a-1 and miR-141 in patients undergoing prostate biopsy clinical suspicious for prostate cancer (PCA) in a prospective multi-center study.Pre-biopsy serum samples of 170 patients were collected in three different study Centres. Serum RNA was isolated, and microRNA lev-els were quantified using real-time PCR. Relative miR-26a -1 and miR-141 levels were determined using RNU1-4 and SNORD43 as reference genes.After exclusion of pa-tients with metastatic prostate cancer (n=9) and isolation failures (n=28), 133 patients (prostate cancer n=54, non-malignant n=79) were used for further analysis. The levels of miR-26a-1 and miR-141 were similar in patients with positive and negative biopsies. We observed a significant increase of miR-141 in patients with higher Gleason Score.The analysis of circulating microRNAs does not seem to help identify patients with cancer undergoing prostate biopsy. However, their levels may be useful to identify patients with high-risk prostate cancer.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510997","annotations":[{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.880709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.733959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.649401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.621736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Prostate biopsy","weight":0.601429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_biopsy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.537436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"A1 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_(band)"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Russian National Unity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_National_Unity"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Principal component analysis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Psychohistory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"}]}
