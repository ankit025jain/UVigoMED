{"id":67196,"title":"Gene expression of androgen metabolising enzymes in benign prostatic hyperplasia.","abstract":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia is still one of the most important problems of modern urology. We studied the gene expression of androgen metabolic enzymes involved in the synthesis of androgens directly in the target organs in 20 patients using real-time RP-PCR. A significant increase in the mRNA of HSD1 7B3 approximately 1,7 fold, SRD5A2 approximately 2 fold, HSD3B1 approximately 2 fold, STS approximately 2,3 fold u AR -2.5 fold and reduced HSD17B2 approximately 4 fold in samples of tumor tissue compared with adjacent tissues.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640095","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.83645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.687712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.500002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.472615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"SRD5A2","weight":0.31781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRD5A2"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.139685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Niacin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niacin"},{"name":"Third baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman"},{"name":"Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardanger_Sunnhordlandske_Dampskipsselskap"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Island Explorer","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_Explorer"},{"name":"System Reference Document","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Reference_Document"},{"name":"Arkansas's 2nd congressional district","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas's_2nd_congressional_district"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"3B1","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3B1"}]}
