{"id":83496,"title":"[Selective COX-2 inhibitor versus nonselective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor in the prevention of heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty: a meta-analysis of randomised trials].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical efficiency of selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor compared to traditional nonselective NSAIDs for the prevention of heterotopic ossification (HO) after total hip arthroplasty (THA).By searching Medline, Embase, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and Science Citation Index et al, only randomised controlled studies of selective COX-2 inhibitors VS nonselective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors for the prevention of HO after THA were included. The quality assessment of included studies was evaluated according to the standard of the Cochrane Collaboration, and the data were analysised by statistic software Stata 10.0. The HO incidence of both groups in different degrees was compared.Four eligible randomised controlled trials of totally 808 patients were included. Meta-analysis results showed that no statistically significant difference was found in overall incidence of HO (RR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.71-1.64,P = 0.73), incidence of moderate severe HO (Brooker II and III) (RR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.48-1.42, P = 0.49) and any grade of Brooker classification between two groups. In all included studies, 16 patients receiving nonselective COX inhibitor (4.4%) discontinued treatment because of gastrointestinal toxicity,whereas 10 patients in the selective COX-2 inhibitor group (2.7%) discontinued for gastrointestinal side effects.The selective COX-2 inhibitors are as equally effective as nonselective NSAIDs for the prevention of HO after THA. Considering the side effects of nonselective NSAIDs, selective COX-2 inhibitors were recommend for the prevention of HO after THA.","date":"2014-10-23","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs
