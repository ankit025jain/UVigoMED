{"id":69075,"title":"One- vs 4-week stent placement after laparoscopic and robot-assisted pyeloplasty: results of a prospective randomised single-centre study.","abstract":"To determine whether 1-week stenting of the pelvi-ureteric anastomosis of laparoscopic or robot-assisted pyeloplasty is as effective as 4-week stenting, based on their respective success rates.A total of 100 patients with pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction were treated by Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty and the anastomosis was stented using a 6-F JJ catheter for either 1 week (1W series) or 4 weeks (4W series), based on a randomisation protocol. Postoperative follow-up was performed at 3 months using intravenous urography (IVU), at 6 months using diuretic renography and at 1, 3 and 5 years using ultrasonography. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-sided Z-test, Pearsons's chi-squared test and a Wilcoxon rank sum test.The primary outcome measure, success rate, which was defined as no obstruction on IVU and diuretic renography, was 100% in the 1W series and not inferior to the success rate of 98% in the 4W series (P = 0.006). The following secondary outcome measures were not significantly different between the 1W and the 4W series with regard to residual symptoms (10 vs 6%; P = 0.48), rate of complications (4 vs 6%; P = 0.65), need for synchronous robot-assisted pyelolithotomy (4 vs 8%; P = 0.47), improvement in split renal function (1 vs 0%; P = 0.59) and duration of surgery (200 vs 192?min; P = 0.87). Only length of hospital stay was significantly different; this was shorter in the 1W series (5 vs 6 days; P = 0.01).Stenting of the pelvi-ureteric anastomosis after laparoscopic or robot-assisted pyeloplasty for 1 week is as effective as stenting for 4 weeks. Both procedures, laparoscopic or robot-assisted pyeloplasty have an excellent success rate.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24472002","annotations":[{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.891218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Intravenous pyelogram","weight":0.809133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_pyelogram"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.806587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.779394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.731783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0988814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Districts of Mongolia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Mongolia"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM-Ford_6-speed_automatic_transmission"},{"name":"2011 Six Nations Championship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Six_Nations_Championship"},{"name":"Pyeloplasty","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyeloplasty"}]}
