{"id":72836,"title":"Outcome prediction in plasmacytoma of bone: a risk model utilizing bone marrow flow cytometry and light-chain analysis.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to use multiparameter flow cytometry to detect occult marrow disease (OMD) in patients with solitary plasmacytoma of bone and assess its value in predicting outcome. Aberrant phenotype plasma cells were demonstrable in 34 of 50 (68%) patients and comprised a median of 0.52% of bone marrow leukocytes. With a median follow-up of 3.7 years, 28 of 50 patients have progressed with a median time to progression (TTP) of 18 months. Progression was documented in 72% of patients with OMD vs 12.5% without (median TTP, 26 months vs not reached; P = .003). Monoclonal urinary light chains (ULC) were similarly predictive of outcome because progression was documented in 91% vs 44% without (median TTP, 16 vs 82 months; P < .001). By using both parameters, it was possible to define patients with an excellent outcome (lacking both OMD and ULC, 7.7% progression) and high-risk patients (OMD and/or ULC, 75% progression; P = .001). Trials of systemic therapy are warranted in high-risk patients.
