{"id":88222,"title":"Diagnosis and management of shock in the emergency department.","abstract":"Shock is a state of acute circulatory failure leading to decreased organ perfusion, with inadequate delivery of oxygenated blood to tissues and resultant end-organ dysfunction. The mechanisms that can result in shock are divided into 4 categories: (1) hypovolemic, (2) distributive, (3) cardiogenic, and (4) obstructive. While much is known regarding treatment of patients in shock, several controversies continue in the literature. Assessment begins with identifying the need for critical interventions such as intubation, mechanical ventilation, or obtaining vascular access. Prompt workup should be initiated with laboratory testing (especially of serum lactate levels) and imaging, as indicated. Determining the intravascular volume status of patients in shock is critical and aids in categorizing and informing treatment decisions. This issue reviews the 4 primary categories of shock as well as special categories, including shock in pregnancy, traumatic shock, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock in myocardial infarction. Adherence to evidence-based care of the specific causes of shock can optimize a patient's chances of surviving this life-threatening condition.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24883457","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiogenic shock","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiogenic_shock"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Septic shock","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.746321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hypovolemia","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovolemia"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.668921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.659725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.633726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.564224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.411136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.282573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.148516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.073608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Intravascular volume status","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravascular_volume_status"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
