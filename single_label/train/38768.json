{"id":38768,"title":"Maternal hypertension, medication use, and hypospadias in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study.","abstract":"To investigate whether antihypertensive classes and specific medications in early pregnancy increase the risk of severe hypospadias and to assess prior associations detected for late-treated and untreated hypertension in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study.Using telephone interviews from mothers of 2,131 children with severe hypospadias and 5,129 nonmalformed male control children for 1997-2009 births in a population-based case-control study, we estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with multivariable logistic regression. We adjusted P values to account for multiple testing.Forty-eight (2.3%) case and 70 (1.4%) control mothers reported early pregnancy antihypertensive treatment, 45 (2.1%) case and 31 (0.6%) control mothers reported late treatment, and 315 (14.8%) case and 394 (7.7%) control mothers reported untreated hypertension. Selective ?-blockers, centrally acting agents, renin-angiotensin system-acting agents, diuretics, and specific medications, methyldopa and atenolol, were not associated with hypospadias. Nonselective ?-blockers (adjusted OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.47-7.05) were associated with hypospadias; however, P values adjusted for multiple testing were not statistically significant. We confirmed prior findings for associations between hypospadias and untreated hypertension (adjusted OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.76-2.48) and late initiation of treatment (adjusted OR 3.98, 95% CI 2.41-6.55). The increased risks would translate to severe hypospadias prevalences of 11.5, 17.7, and 21.9 per 10,000 births for women with untreated hypertension, nonselective ?-blocker use, and late initiation of treatment, respectively.Our study suggests a relationship between hypospadias and the severity of hypertension.II.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
