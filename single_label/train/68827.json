{"id":68827,"title":"Association between X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 Arg194Trp polymorphism and prostate cancer risk.","abstract":"X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) plays an important role in the maintenance of the genomic integrity. Previous studies on the association between XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism and prostate cancer risk reported conflicting results. To get a more precise assessment of the association between XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism and prostate cancer risk, we performed a meta-analysis of previously published studies. Eligible studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Nine studies with a total of 5,407 subjects were finally included into the meta-analysis. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was used to assess the association. Overall, there was no obvious association between XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism and prostate cancer risk (Trp vs. Arg: OR?=?1.02, 95%CI 0.84-1.25, P?=?0.824; TrpTrp vs. ArgArg: OR?=?1.17, 95%CI 0.83-1.66, P?=?0.374; TrpTrp/ArgTrp vs. ArgArg: OR?=?1.00, 95%CI 0.79-1.28, P?=?0.990; TrpTrp vs. ArgArg/ArgTrp: OR?=?1.20, 95%CI 0.85-1.68, P?=?0.301). Subgroup analysis according to ethnicity also detected no significant association in both Asians and Caucasians. In conclusion, the meta-analysis suggests that there is no obvious association between XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism and prostate cancer risk.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492938","annotations":[{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.781812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.588694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.544616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.514076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"China","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Tryptophan","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"XRCC1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XRCC1"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Infrastructure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0210681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"824","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/824"},{"name":"791","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/791"},{"name":"407","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/407"},{"name":"841","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/841"},{"name":"831","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/831"},{"name":"851","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/851"},{"name":"990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/990"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"The Model Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Model_Home"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
