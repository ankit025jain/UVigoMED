{"id":48011,"title":"Co-modulated behavior and effects of differentially expressed miRNA in colorectal cancer.","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs (approximately 22 nucleotides in length) that play important roles in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression through silencing gene expression. Numerous dysregulated miRNAs simultaneously participate in the process of colon cancer development. However, the detailed mechanisms and biological functions of co-expressed miRNA in colorectal carcinogenesis have yet to be fully elucidated.The objective of this study was to identify the dysfunctional miRNAs and their target mRNAs using a wet-lab experimental and dry-lab bioinformatics approach. The differentially expressed miRNA candidates were identified from 2 miRNA profiles, and were confirmed in CRC clinical samples using reported target genes of dysfunctional miRNAs to perform functional pathway enrichment analysis. Potential target gene candidates were predicted by an in silico search, and their expression levels between normal and colorectal tumor tissues were further analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Fifteen dysfunctional miRNAs were engaged in metastasis-associated pathways through comodulating 7 target genes, which were identified by using a multi-step approach. The roles of these candidate genes are worth further exploration in the progression of colon cancer, and could potentially be targets in future therapy.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564330","annotations":[{"name":"Candidate gene","weight":0.922179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_gene"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.71541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.713157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.552802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.53219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.479223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"In silico","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.438474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.426775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.297191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.228042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Sampling bias","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
