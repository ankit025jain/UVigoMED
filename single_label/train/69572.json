{"id":69572,"title":"Hyperuricemia is a significant risk factor for the onset of chronic kidney disease.","abstract":"Recent studies have shown that hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, few studies have examined whether hyperuricemia is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), so to investigate the significance of hyperuricemia as a risk factor for CKD, we analyzed data collected in annual health check-ups.The data of 11,048 subjects who underwent an annual health check-up were analyzed in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.After adjustment for covariate factors, a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, HbA1c, and uric acid (hazard ratio: 1.66) were independently and significantly associated with CKD. We also analyzed the data of 1,652 subjects who underwent annual health check-ups for 5 consecutive years. Over that 5-year period, 93 subjects developed CKD. We compared the baseline data of the subjects who developed CKD with the data of those who did not, and we found significant between-group differences in gender, age, HDL-cholesterol, the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and uric acid. After adjustment for several covariate factors, a multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that only age and hyperuricemia (hazard ratio: 1.36) were independent risk factors for the development of CKD.We found that hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for the development of CKD.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434843","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"Hyperuricemia","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperuricemia"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.729617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.726288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.656323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.581101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.575943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Covariate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariate"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
