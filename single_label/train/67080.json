{"id":67080,"title":"[Morphological results of repeated transurethral resection of the bladder for muscle-non-invasive cancer].","abstract":"Operating material taken from 101 patients aged 32 to 88 years with verified bladder cancer was investigated. Repeated morphological analysis of biopsy material obtained after repeated transurethral resection (TUR) has revealed 35.6% of residual tumors, and the same stage cancer was diagnosed in 23% of cases, lower stage Ta cancer--in 5% of cases. Underestimating the stage took place in 7.9% of cases. Residual tumors according to histological examination were revealed in 24.7% of patients. In tumor size larger than 3 cm, the frequency of detection of residual tumors and muscular invasion was 44.8 and 12.1%, and in tumor size less than 3 cm--23.2 and 2.3%, respectively. Residual tumor was found in 45.7% of cases with rT1G3 and in 27.2% of cases with rT1G2. The muscle invasion was observed only in low-grade tumors--13.5% of cases. In the presence of muscular tissue, invasion was diagnosed in 1.4% of cases, and in the absence of muscular tissue--in 20.5%. Repeated TUR of bladder for muscles-non-invasive cancer allows achieving optimal local control, obtaining additional histological material for morphological examination to confirm the stage of the disease, there from, choose the appropriate treatment and remove residual tumor.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649770","annotations":[{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Transurethral resection of the prostate","weight":0.388645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transurethral_resection_of_the_prostate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.351104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.261032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"The Guardian","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"1G","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1G"},{"name":"Morphological analysis","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_analysis"},{"name":"Tantalum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantalum"},{"name":"2005 World Series","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_World_Series"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
