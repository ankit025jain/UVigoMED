{"id":72868,"title":"Case for diagnosis.","abstract":"Granular cell tumour is a rare tumour of neural origin usually located on the face and the neck. The biological behaviour is usually benign. However, certain clinical and histopathological features should alert physicians to a malignant behaviour. This case report describes the occurrence of a granular cell tumour in the inguinal area that resembled a malignant tumour. The histopathological study revealed typical features of granular cell tumour and an extension study confirmed the absence of metastasis. This case highlights the importance of considering this disorder in the differential diagnosis of ulcerated nodules and of managing atypical granular cell tumor appropriately.
