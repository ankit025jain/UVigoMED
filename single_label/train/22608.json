{"id":22608,"title":"Mycobacterium marinum infection following contact with reptiles: vivarium granuloma.","abstract":"A 19-year-old man presented with a 1.5-cm nodule on the first dorsal metacarpal ray. The patient denied having contact with fish tanks or fish, but recalled handling many reptiles without gloves in the vivarium where he worked. A culture of a skin biopsy specimen yielded Mycobacterium marinum. The clinical outcome was favourable after a 2-week course of intramuscular gentamicin (180 mg daily) combined with a 6-week course of oral clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day). Doctors should be aware that vivariums, in addition to fish tanks, can be sources of M. marinum exposure.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530276","annotations":[{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Clarithromycin","weight":0.831158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarithromycin"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.633261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.535661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.445241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Skin biopsy","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_biopsy"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.310572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Reptile","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Aquarium","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.0976131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Metacarpus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpus"},{"name":"Vivarium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivarium"},{"name":"Mycobacterium marinum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_marinum"},{"name":"Tank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank"},{"name":"Glove","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"},{"name":"Batoidea","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batoidea"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 19","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_19"}]}
