{"id":45178,"title":"Clinical significance of combined testing of YKL-40 with CEA in Chinese colorectal cancer patients.","abstract":"To investigate the practical value of individual and combined testing of plasma levels of YKL-40, CEA, and CA199 for auxiliary diagnosis and detection of recurrence of colorectal cancer.ELISA and ECLIA were used to evaluate levels of YKL-40, CEA, and CA199 in 120 colorectal cancer patients (56 initial-diagnosis, 42 post-operative, and 22 recurrent cases). Forty-three patients with benign colorectal disease and 36 healthy patients were enrolled as controls. The relationship between YKL-40 and clinical indicators of tumor pathology was analyzed. The positive rate and diagnostic efficacy of single and combined YKL-40, CEA, and CA199 testing were assessed in patients with colorectal cancer.Plasma YKL-40 in the cancer group was significantly higher than in the benign control and healthy control group, and the mean values were 145.4 ng/mL, 107.7 ng/mL, and 51.3 ng/mL (p < 0.05), respectively. With 72 ng/mL as the diagnostic threshold, the sensitivity and specificity of YKL-40 in colorectal cancer diagnosis were found to be 73.2% and 66.7%, respectively. Early-stage colorectal cancer patients showed a YKL-40 positive rate (73%) significantly higher than those of CEA and CA199 (50% and 32%, respectively; p < 0.05). When YKL-40 testing was combined with CEA or CA199, the positive rate increased to 82.1% and 80.3%, respectively. Through ROC curve analysis of the post-operative recurrent group against the non-recurrent group, the areas under the curve for YKL-40, CEA, and CA199 were found to be 0.907, 0.714, and 0.759, respectively. Based on the Dukes classification, the mean YKL-40 value for stages A/B, C, and D were 120.1 ng/mL, 131.7 ng/mL, and 226.8 ng/mL (p = 0.008), respectively. The plasma YKL-40 level gradually increased as the disease progressed. Lower degrees of tumor differentiation were correlated with higher YKL-40 levels. The mean YKL-40 values of high, medium, and low tumor differentiation groups were 96.8 ng/mL, 127.5 ng/mL, and 225.7 ng/mL (p = 0.004), respectively.The benefits of using YKL-40 testing are higher than CEA and CA199 for the monitoring of colorectal cancer recurrence. Combined testing of both YKL-40 and CEA was found to be optimal for auxiliary diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Plasma YKL-40 was found to be suitable for auxiliary diagnosis of colorectal cancer.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697115","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.797668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.726382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.660502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.646318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.616083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.569012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"China","weight":0.496625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.44922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.403118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.368405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.156125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Carcinoembryonic antigen","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoembryonic_antigen"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"759","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/759"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"907","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/907"},{"name":"225","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/225"},{"name":"226","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/226"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Bachelor of Arts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
