{"id":60748,"title":"Engineering more efficacious antibody therapy for myeloma.","abstract":"In this issue of Blood, Tai et al describe a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) for myeloma, which is both glycoengineered and conjugated to a cytotoxic agent. This mAb targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and has considerable preclinical activity, thus holding therapeutic promise. The outlook for myeloma patients has greatly improved over the past decade with the introduction of a number of novel agents. However, there is still a significant unmet need because many patients with gene expression profilingâ€“defined good-risk disease eventually relapse and high-risk myeloma has poor long-term disease-free survival in the majority of patients.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24832938","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibody therapy","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody_therapy"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.551285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.241043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"TNFRSF17","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNFRSF17"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"}]}
