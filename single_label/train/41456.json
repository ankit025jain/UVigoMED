{"id":41456,"title":"[Prognostication of gastroduodenal ulcer course complicated by hemorrhage].","abstract":"Dynamics of the blood serum level of serotonin in the patients, suffering gastroduodenal ulcer, Complicated by hemorrhage, was analyzed. The highest level of serotonin was observed in gastric ulcer, complicated by hemorrhage. These changes correlate with the blood loss severity enhancement, the achievement of a nonstable state of endoscopic hemostasis, high activity of inducible NO-synthase (iNOS) of periulcerative mucosa. The obtained data analysis permits to prognosticate the pathological process course and to improve the program of treatment.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923139","annotations":[{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.826868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.432155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.176375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Divination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination"}]}
