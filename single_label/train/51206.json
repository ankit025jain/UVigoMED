{"id":51206,"title":"Relationship between continuity of ambulatory care and medication adherence in adult patients with type 2 diabetes in Korea: a longitudinal analysis.","abstract":"Medication adherence is the most important factor in the proper management of patients with diabetes. Considering the importance of informational continuity in a changing world, it could be meaningful to improve institution-level continuity of care and its positive relationship with medication adherence.We examined the relationship between institution-level continuity of ambulatory care and medication adherence in adult patients with type 2 diabetes receiving a new hypoglycemic prescription and sought to determine whether an improvement in medication adherence could be achieved through an ongoing relationship between the patient and the medical care institution.This was a longitudinal study of 23,034 patients aged 20 years and older enrolled in the Korea National Health Insurance (KNHI) program and first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2004. The patients were followed-up for 4 years using claims data to measure continuity of ambulatory care and adherence to oral antihyperglycemic medications. The Continuity of Care Index (COCI) was calculated on the institution level as a measure of continuity and the medication possession ratio (MPR) was used as a measure of adherence.After adjusting for confounding variables, the odds of being medication adherent (MPR ? 0.8) increased as the COCI increased [0.2?COCI<0.4, odds ratio (OR)=2.20; 0.4?COCI<0.6, OR=3.46; 0.6?COCI<0.8, OR=4.76; 0.8?COCI<1.0, OR=4.43; COCI=1.0, OR=7.24].Institution-level continuity of ambulatory care was positively associated with medication adherence, which suggested that a high concentration of ambulatory care visits, whether it's a physician or an institution, could facilitate delivery of proper medical services to and increases medication adherence among patients with type 2 diabetes, and that institution-level continuity of ambulatory care could be an effective index for assessing the quality of chronic care in the fragmented health care delivery system as in Korea.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714582","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.769047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.6682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.625722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.615117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.560053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.499137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.334694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Ambulatory care","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_care"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.266553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"National health insurance","weight":0.225947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_health_insurance"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.152162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0880793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0776294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0763854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Transitional care","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_care"}]}
