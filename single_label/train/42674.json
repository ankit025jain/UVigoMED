{"id":42674,"title":"Knowledge of norovirus prevention and control among infection preventionists.","abstract":"A Web-based survey was administered to infection preventionists (IPs) (N = 941) to characterize awareness and knowledge of norovirus (NoV). Only 44% of respondents correctly identified NoV as one of the 3 most common foodborne pathogens in the United States, and 5% correctly identified the 3 most common settings for NoV outbreaks. Several gaps in IPs' knowledge of NoV were identified; specifically, IPs could benefit from learning more about the natural history of NoV, modes of transmission, and cleaning and disinfection processes.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837119","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.327476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Norovirus","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"History","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.125004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Food microbiology","weight":0.0223718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_microbiology"},{"name":"Intellectual property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"941","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/941"},{"name":"Amateur radio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Foodborne illness","weight":0.0156704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"}]}
