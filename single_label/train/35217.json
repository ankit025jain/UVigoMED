{"id":35217,"title":"Transposition of the great arteries--outcomes and time interval of early neonatal repair.","abstract":"This study evaluates the relationship of morbidity and resource utilization with the timing of early neonatal repair of transposition of the great arteries and intact ventricular septum (d-TGA/IVS).All patients with d-TGA/IVS who underwent arterial switch in the first 14 days of life, between January 2000 and May 2011, were reviewed. Patients undergoing repair at ? 4 days of age were categorized as group I, 5 to 7 days as group II, and 8 to 14 days as group III. Outcomes included mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization.Hospital survival was 69 (98.6%) of 70. The length of stay (LOS) and total charges were lowest in group I--15.5 days compared to group II--18.0 days and group III--23.5 days (P = .005); group I--US$128,219 compared to group II--US$141,729 and group III--US$217,427 (P = .0006). Using regression analysis to account for potentially confounding effects of multiple variables and treating time as a continuous variable demonstrated that age at surgery was significantly associated with total LOS (P = .029), hospital charges (P = .029) and intensive care unit charges (P = .002). Younger age at repair was not associated with worse outcomes for any measure of morbidity.Earlier repair of d-TGA/IVS was associated with decreased resource utilization and no detriment to clinical outcomes. Further analysis based on a larger cohort of patients is needed to verify these results that have important implications for improving the value of care.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668972","annotations":[{"name":"Infant","weight":0.668446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Transposition of the great vessels","weight":0.592152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_of_the_great_vessels"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.587584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.385991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.324244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.279253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Jatene procedure","weight":0.194905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatene_procedure"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.121231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Great arteries","weight":0.10801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_arteries"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Switch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"217","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/217"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"219","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/219"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"FAA airport categories","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAA_airport_categories"},{"name":"In-situ resource utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-situ_resource_utilization"},{"name":"Inertial Upper Stage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_Upper_Stage"},{"name":"Group II intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_II_intron"},{"name":"Resource","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Boron group","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_group"}]}
