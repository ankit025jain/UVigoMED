{"id":44741,"title":"Surgical therapy and chemoradiotherapy for postoperative recurrent esophageal cancer.","abstract":"A retrospective analysis of therapeutic modalities used in postoperative recurrent esophageal cancer.Among 43 esophageal cancer patients who underwent esophagectomy between 2003 and 2010, recurrence was found in 15. Best supportive care was given to two patients and another patient was referred to another hospital. The remaining 12 patients were treated by the following modalities: Surgical resection: 2 cases; chemoradiotherapy: 7 cases; chemotherapy: 2 cases; and radiotherapy: 1 case. The median survival time, 1-year survival rates, and response rates were examined. Data from 13 esophageal cancer patients who underwent chemoradiotheray as an initial therapy in the same period were collected and compared with recurrent cases treated with chemoradiotherapy.For all 12 patients, the median overall survival time was 19.5 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 83%. Among 7 chemoradiotherapy patients, the response rate was 57%. The median survival time was 23 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 86%. The response rate of 13 patients receiving chemoradiotherapy as an initial therapy was 69%. The median overall survival time was 12 months and the 1-year survival rate was 54%.Re-operation and chemoradiotherapy for recurrent esophageal cancer might be as effective as the same treatment used initially.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719935","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.813961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Esophagectomy","weight":0.61431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagectomy"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.183407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
