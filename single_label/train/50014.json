{"id":50014,"title":"Heterochromatin protein 1 expression is reduced in human thyroid malignancy.","abstract":"Owing to the loss of heterochromatin integrity that occurs during thyroid tumorigenesis, the expression of Heterochromatin Protein 1 isoforms HP1? and HP1? was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 189 thyroid tumors and non-neoplastic tissues. Expression of HP1? was significantly decreased in all thyroid lesions, except in follicular adenomas, when compared with matched adjacent normal tissue. This loss of HP1? expression may in part be caused by microRNA dysregulation. An example is miR-205, a microRNA that is abundantly upregulated in thyroid carcinomas and shown to reduce the expression of HP1?. In contrast to HP1?, HP1? expression was only reduced in metastatic carcinomas and poorly differentiated lesions. These results suggest the reduction of HP1? followed by a decrease in HP1? contributes to the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinomas, and their loss is a potential marker of thyroid malignancy and metastatic potential, respectively.
