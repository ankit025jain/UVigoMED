{"id":44316,"title":"Glucocorticoid therapy for gastrointestinal diseases.","abstract":"Glucocorticoids are widely used as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents in many immune-mediated gastrointestinal diseases. However, a number of undesirable side effects may occur and dictate continuous surveillance and monitoring to prevent complications.This review of the English language literature identified on PubMed focuses on key aspects of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with gastrointestinal diseases, highlighting specific aspects of recognition and management of its secondary effects.Long-term cohort studies as well as placebo- and sham-controlled trials have evaluated the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of glucocorticoid therapy in many gastrointestinal diseases. Other immunosuppressive and biological therapies have made glucocorticoid therapy part of a broader arsenal of therapies. Newer compounds that carry less systemic toxicity and improved tolerability are increasingly used. For several gastrointestinal diseases, the role of the mucosal immunity is currently being explored and microscopic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa may have an important pathogenetic role. Glucocorticoid therapy, particularly with newer, safer compounds, may play an important new role in patients with altered motility and visceral hypersensitivity. The interplay of the gut microbiota and the host that contributes to the development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues and gut-specific immune responses will also undoubtedly be explored.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742121","annotations":[{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.883832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.776736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.755699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.57953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.447351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Intestinal mucosa","weight":0.294323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_mucosa"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.272084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Digestive disease","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_disease"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"England","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"}]}
