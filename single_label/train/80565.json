{"id":80565,"title":"Safety of the combined use of praziquantel and albendazole in the treatment of human hydatid disease.","abstract":"There is still no well-established consensus about the clinical management of hydatidosis. Currently, surgery continues to be the first therapeutic option, although treatment with anti-parasitic drugs is indicated as an adjuvant to surgery to decrease the number of relapses and hydatid cyst size. When surgery is not possible, medical treatment is indicated. Traditionally, albendazole was used in monotherapy as the standard treatment. However, combined therapy with albendazole plus praziquantel appears to improve anti-parasitic effectiveness. To date, no safety studies focusing on such combined therapy have been published for the treatment of hydatidosis. In this work, we analyze the adverse effects seen in 57 patients diagnosed with hydatidosis who were treated with praziquantel plus albendazole combined therapy between 2006 and 2010.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615131","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.743483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.534913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.272369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Antiparasitic","weight":0.225141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparasitic"},{"name":"Praziquantel","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praziquantel"},{"name":"Albendazole","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albendazole"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"}]}
