{"id":65389,"title":"Affinity of alkylphosphocholines to biological membrane of prostate cancer: studies in natural and model systems.","abstract":"The effectiveness of two alkylphosphocholines (APCs), hexadecylphosphocholine (miltefosine) and erucylphosphocholine to combat prostate cancer has been studied in vitro with artificial cancerous membrane, modelled with the Langmuir monolayer technique, and on cell line (Du-145). Studies performed with the Langmuir method indicate that both the investigated drugs have the affinity to the monolayer mimicking prostate cancer membrane (composed of cholesterol:POPC = 0.428) and the drug-membrane interactions are stronger for erucylphosphocholine as compared to hexadecylphosphocholine. Moreover, both studied drugs were found to fluidize the model membrane, which may lead to apoptosis. Indeed, biological studies confirmed that in Du-145 cell line both investigated alkylphosphocholines cause cell death primarily by apoptosis while necrotic cells constitute only a small percentage of APC-treated cells.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848301","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.791143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.5807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.541721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Monolayer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolayer"},{"name":"Miltefosine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miltefosine"},{"name":"Irving Langmuir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Langmuir"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Antigen-presenting cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen-presenting_cell"},{"name":"Combat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.0152163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"}]}
