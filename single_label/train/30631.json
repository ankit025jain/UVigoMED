{"id":30631,"title":"Effects of acute and long-term typical or atypical neuroleptics on morphine-induced behavioural effects in mice.","abstract":"1. It has been suggested that the high prevalence of drug abuse in schizophrenics is related to chronic treatment with typical neuroleptics and dopaminergic supersensitivity that develops as a consequence. Within this context, atypical neuroleptics do not seem to induce this phenomenon. In the present study, we investigated the effects of acute administration or withdrawal from long-term administration of haloperidol and/or ziprasidone on morphine-induced open-field behaviour in mice. 2. In the first experiment, mice were given a single injection of haloperidol (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or several doses of ziprasidone (2, 4 or 6 mg/kg, i.p.) and motor activity was quantified by the open-field test. The aim of the second experiment was to verify the effects of an acute injection of haloperidol (1 mg/kg) or ziprasidone (6 mg/kg) on 20 mg/kg morphine-induced behaviours in the open-field test. In the third experiment, mice were treated with 1 mg/kg haloperidol and/or 2, 4 or 6 mg/kg ziprasidone for 20 days. Seventy-two hours after the last injection, mice were injected with 20 mg/kg, i.p., morphine and then subjected to the open-field test. Acute haloperidol or ziprasidone decreased spontaneous general activity and abolished morphine-induced locomotor stimulation. 3. Withdrawal from haloperidol or ziprasidone did not modify morphine-elicited behaviours in the open-field test. The results suggest that withdrawal from neuroleptic treatments does not contribute to the acute effect of morphine in schizophrenic patients.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471703","annotations":[{"name":"Haloperidol","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haloperidol"},{"name":"Ziprasidone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziprasidone"},{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Typical antipsychotic","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typical_antipsychotic"},{"name":"Antipsychotic","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Atypical antipsychotic","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical_antipsychotic"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.158256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
