{"id":82085,"title":"Pediatric dentists' willingness to participate in practice-based research networks.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine the willingness of pediatric dentists to participate in practice-based research networks (PBRNs) and the factors associated with their willingness.A 29-item cross-sectional survey was collected from pediatric dentists in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, and Montana. Logistic regression models were used to test for demographic and educational factors associated with a willingness to participate in PBRNs.Of 337 surveys mailed or emailed, 171 (51 percent) were returned. Seventy-four (43 percent) pediatric dentists expressed a willingness to participate in PBRNs. Younger age (P=.01), greater number of regularly read scientific journals (P=.04), frequent utilization of scientific web searches (P=.05), national dental meetings for practice guidance (P=.001), lack of concern about time to participate (P=.01), and quality of data obtained in PBRN studies (P=.03) were associated with increased willingness to participate. Caries prevention was the most important topic in which to conduct more research.There is a broad base of pediatric dentists willing to participate in dental practice-based research networks. Younger age and greater utilization of certain practice guidance resources were associated with increased willingness to participate. Practitioner demand for additional research is in the area of caries prevention.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717708","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.688474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Utah","weight":0.65643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.598602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Idaho","weight":0.472036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho"},{"name":"Montana","weight":0.472036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.472036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.471883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.371548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Washington (state)","weight":0.227273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.211204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.171935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Web search engine","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0730188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Scientific journal","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"Academic journal","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"337","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/337"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Caries","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caries"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Topic (linguistics)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Military base","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_base"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Focke-Wulf A 17","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_A_17"}]}
