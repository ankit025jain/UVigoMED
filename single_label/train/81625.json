{"id":81625,"title":"Active implant peri-apical lesion: a case report treated via guided bone regeneration with a 5-year clinical and radiographic follow-up.","abstract":"Implant peri-apical lesion (IPL) is a periapical lesion, usually asymptomatic, in which the coronal portion of the implant achieves a normal bone to implant interface. A case of IPL following immediate implant placement and treated with guided bone regeneration (GBR) principles is described. Five-year clinical and radiographic follow-up with cone-beam assessment showed complete healing of the bone. GBR principles applied to IPL could completely solve the lesion.
