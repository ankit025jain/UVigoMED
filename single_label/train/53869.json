{"id":53869,"title":"Assessment of the cardiovascular safety of saxagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: pooled analysis of 20 clinical trials.","abstract":"It is important to establish the cardiovascular (CV) safety profile of novel antidiabetic drugs.Pooled analyses were performed of 20 randomized controlled studies (N?=?9156) of saxagliptin as monotherapy or add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as well as a subset of 11 saxagliptin?+?metformin studies. Adjudicated major adverse CV events (MACE; CV death, myocardial infarction [MI], and stroke) and investigator-reported heart failure were assessed, and incidence rates (IRs; events/100 patient-years) and IR ratios (IRRs; saxagliptin/control) were calculated (Mantel-Haenszel method).In pooled datasets, the IR point estimates for MACE and individual components of CV death, MI, and stroke favored saxagliptin, but the 95% CI included 1. IRR (95% CI) for MACE in the 20-study pool was 0.74 (0.45, 1.25). The Cox proportional hazard ratio (95% CI) was 0.75 (0.46, 1.21), suggesting no increased risk of MACE in the 20-study pool. In the 11-study saxagliptin?+?metformin pool, the IRR for MACE was 0.93 (0.44, 1.99). In the 20-study pool, the IRR for heart failure was 0.55 (0.27, 1.12).Analysis of pooled data from 20 clinical trials in patients with T2DM suggests that saxagliptin is not associated with an increased CV risk.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490835","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.837917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.668233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.636844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.512618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.413752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.354557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.210637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.186121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.166338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.105708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Saxagliptin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxagliptin"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Point estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_estimation"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Michigan","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
