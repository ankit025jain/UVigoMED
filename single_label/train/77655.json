{"id":77655,"title":"Estimating the effect of cumulative occupational asbestos exposure on time to lung cancer mortality: using structural nested failure-time models to account for healthy-worker survivor bias.","abstract":"Previous estimates of the effect of occupational asbestos on lung cancer mortality have been obtained by using methods that are subject to the healthy-worker survivor bias. G-estimation of a structural nested model provides consistent exposure effect estimates under this bias.We estimated the effect of cumulative asbestos exposure on lung cancer mortality in a cohort comprising 2564 textile factory workers who were followed from January 1940 to December 2001.At entry, median age was 23 years, with 42% of the cohort being women and 20% nonwhite. During the follow-up period, 15% of person-years were classified as occurring while employed and 13% as occupationally exposed to asbestos. For a 100 fiber-year/ml increase in cumulative asbestos, a Weibull model adjusting for sex, race, birth year, baseline exposure, and age at study entry yielded a survival time ratio of 0.88 (95% confidence interval = 0.83 to 0.93). Further adjustment for work status yielded no practical change. The corresponding survival time ratio obtained using g-estimation of a structural nested model was 0.57 (0.33 to 0.96).Accounting for the healthy-worker survivor bias resulted in a 35% stronger effect estimate. However, this estimate was considerably less precise. When healthy-worker survivor bias is suspected, methods that account for it should be used.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487207","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.646577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.57573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.567805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.513614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.484519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.4655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Textile","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile"},{"name":"Asbestos","weight":0.140403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Factory","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Survivorship bias","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias"},{"name":"Weibull distribution","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"Lists of U.S. cities with non-white majority populations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_U.S._cities_with_non-white_majority_populations"},{"name":"Mere exposure effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_exposure_effect"},{"name":"Cotton mill","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_mill"},{"name":"Consistent estimator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator"},{"name":"Model selection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"}]}
