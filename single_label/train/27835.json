{"id":27835,"title":"Faculty buy-in to teach alcohol and drug use screening.","abstract":"Educating nursing faculty about the use of an evidence-based practice to screen and intervene earlier along the continuum of alcohol and other drug use, misuse, and dependence is essential in today's health care arena. Misuse of alcohol and other drugs is a significant problem for both individual health and societal economic welfare. The purpose of this article is to describe nursing faculty buy-in for the implementation of an evidence-based addiction training program at a university-based school of nursing. Derived from an academic-community partnership, the training program results suggest implications for continuing education and curriculum innovation in schools of nursing and clinical practice. The training content presented can be used in continuing education for nursing faculty across all types of nursing school programs and professional nursing staff employed in multiple settings. The training program was funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration.","date":"2014-10-08","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25153430","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Welfare","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.74922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.713313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.706451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.617087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Curriculum","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum"},{"name":"School","weight":0.515544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Innovation","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation"},{"name":"Faculty (division)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)"},{"name":"Continuing education","weight":0.168332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_education"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Nursing school","weight":0.0818325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_school"},{"name":"Welfare economics","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_economics"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0388964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Health Resources and Services Administration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Resources_and_Services_Administration"},{"name":"Arena","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena"},{"name":"Good Clinical Practice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Clinical_Practice"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Continuum (theory)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(theory)"}]}
