{"id":77581,"title":"Stress reduction in the workplace.","abstract":"The modern radiology department operates within an environment of competition, increased regulation, and decreasing budgets. Functioning in this setting may lead the radiology manager to experience job related stress. Stress in the workplace has been linked to cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disorders. While there are a number of triggers for job related stress, it is important to identify the early warning signs and knee-jerk reactions. Emotional intelligence (EI) is one of several techniques that can be used to reduce job related stress. The key components of EI are self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605441","annotations":[{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.635318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Stress management","weight":0.595057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_management"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.549192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.509239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.49331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.469015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Competition","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.449273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Emotional intelligence","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.330914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.282867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0947559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Budget","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal disorder","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Warning sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_sign"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Early warning radar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_warning_radar"},{"name":"Customer relationship management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Social consciousness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_consciousness"}]}
