{"id":65155,"title":"[Efficiency of spematon in male infertility].","abstract":"The article presents the results of the application of spematon in 39 men from infertile couples with different forms of pathospermia (asthenozoospermia, oligozoospermia, teratozoospermia). It is shown that the effect in the first 3 months of use of spematon is mainly associated with normalization of acrosome reaction of sperm cells. It was established that spematon, due to content of L-carnitine content, zinc, vitamin E, contributes restoration of induction of acrosome reaction.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24956674","annotations":[{"name":"Oligospermia","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligospermia"},{"name":"Acrosome","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrosome"},{"name":"Male infertility","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_infertility"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Spermatozoon","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatozoon"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Acrosome reaction","weight":0.797888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrosome_reaction"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.709788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.656281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Asthenozoospermia","weight":0.398912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthenozoospermia"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.28939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Teratospermia","weight":0.216569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratospermia"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"}]}
