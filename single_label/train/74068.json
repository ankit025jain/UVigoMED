{"id":74068,"title":"BMI1 and TWIST1 downregulated mRNA expression in basal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"BMI1, TWIST1 and SNAI2/SLUG have been implicated in aggressive behavior of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and melanoma and BMI1 expression could identify subtypes of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). However, BMI1, TWIST1 and SNAI2 expression levels in basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) have not been elucidated. We hypothesized BCC could be a good model system to decipher mechanisms which inhibit processes that drive tumor metastasis. The aim of this study was to examine the mRNA expression level of BMI1, TWIST1, and SNAI2 in BCCs.Thirty-five fresh non-metastatic BCC tissue samples and seven fresh normal skin tissue samples were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR.BMI1 and TWIST1 demonstrated marked down-regulation (p<0.00l, p=0.00l respectively), but SNAI2 showed no significant change (p=0.12).Previous literature has clearly demonstrated a positive association between BMI1 and TWIST1 expression and metastatic BCC, aggressive SCC and melanoma. Here, we demonstrated a negative association between BMI1 and TWIST1 mRNA expression level and BCC.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24870796","annotations":[{"name":"Merkel cell carcinoma","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkel_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Basal-cell carcinoma","weight":0.837718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.827475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.783382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Stratum basale","weight":0.763568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_basale"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.744119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Merkel cell","weight":0.701504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkel_cell"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.2824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.217447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Marylebone Cricket Club","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marylebone_Cricket_Club"},{"name":"Twist transcription factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_transcription_factor"},{"name":"BMI1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMI1"},{"name":"SNAI2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNAI2"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Transaction Workflow Innovation Standards Team","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_Workflow_Innovation_Standards_Team"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Decipherment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decipherment"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
