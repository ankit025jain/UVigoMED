{"id":77612,"title":"[A saxophonist with severe glaucoma; stop playing or not?].","abstract":"Glaucoma is a disease of the eye in which the level of intraocular pressure (IOP) determines the rate of disease progression to an important extent. A less well known cause of IOP elevation is playing a wind instrument.In a 49-year-old man with only one functional eye suffering from advanced glaucoma in the other eye, IOP appeared to double when he played the saxophone. He was advised to stop playing; this advice had serious consequences as the patient was a professional musician.Despite limited scientific evidence this advice seems justifiable on account of the patient's relatively young age and the advanced glaucoma .","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548591","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Wind instrument","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_instrument"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.393163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.142266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Musician","weight":0.129098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musician"},{"name":"Wind","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Scientific evidence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Saxophone","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxophone"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"}]}
