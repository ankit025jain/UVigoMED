{"id":87858,"title":"[Lateral supramalleolar artery descending branch antidromic flap for the repair of soft tissue defects in the foot and ankle].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of lateral supramalleolar artery descending branch antidromic flap for the repair of soft tissue defects in the foot and ankle.From May 2009 to October 2013,12 patients with soft tissue defects combined with tendon and bone exposure in the foot and ankle were treated by lateral supramalleolar artery descending branch antidromic flap for the repair of soft tissue defects in the foot and ankle, including 9 males and 3 females with an average age of 37.5 years old ranging from 19 to 58 years. Ten cases had the soft tissue defects in the dorsum of foot and 2 in the ankle. The defect area of soft tissue was from 11 cm x 9 cm to 8 cm x 5 cm.Twelve patients were follow-up for 3 to 12 months (averaged 7.3 months). The flaps of 9 cases were survived,the flaps edges of the other 3 cases were necrosis,and healed after dressing change. The flaps were slightly swelling without ulcer occurrence.Lateral supramalleolar artery descending branch antidromic flap can repairing the damage by one-stage operation with advantage of dissection easy,rich blood supply without sacrifice of major artery.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974435","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.76252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.620194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.590333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.376917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.246489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.164505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Antidromic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidromic"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Clothing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"},{"name":"Sacrifice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice"},{"name":"British Rail Class EF1","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_EF1"}]}
