{"id":85939,"title":"Understanding quality-of-life while living with late-stage lung cancer: an exploratory study.","abstract":"U.S. Veterans have a higher prevalence of advanced lung cancer and poorer survival outcomes compared to the general population; yet, no studies exist which specifically explore the psychosocial and existential quality-of-life (QOL) of late-stage lung cancer among this population. This article presents the perspectives of older veterans (N = 12) living with late-stage lung cancer who were receiving chemotherapy, routine hospice care, or both concurrently. Based on individual interviews, themes associated with loss of functionality, close relationships, and communicative acts contributed to veterans' perceptions of diminished or enhanced QOL while living with advanced disease. An overarching theme, loss of the person I know myself to be, suggests that personhood is an important concept to consider in QOL assessment. While findings suggest that the experiences of older Veterans with late-stage lung cancer are similar to other populations of lung cancer patients, and persons with incurable cancer in general, further research regarding the influence of veteran identity at end-of-life is warranted. Further research is needed which explores the influence of a whole person approach to QOL during life-limiting illness and end-of-life decision-making, particularly while receiving late-stage cancer-directed therapy.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24835383","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.485295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.447954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.422166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Existentialism","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.152058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Person","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person"},{"name":"Hospice","weight":0.0568868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospice"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Veteran","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Sentence (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)"},{"name":"Speech act","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act"},{"name":"Concept album","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_album"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Theme (literature)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)"}]}
