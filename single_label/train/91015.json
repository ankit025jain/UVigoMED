{"id":91015,"title":"Long-term MRI findings of muslin-induced foreign body granulomas after aneurysm wrapping. A report of two cases and literature review.","abstract":"Muslin-induced foreign body granulomas are rare delayed complications after wrapping of intracranial aneurysms. Few small case series have been reported, with a paucity of documented MRI findings. In addition, there are no reports on long-term radiological appearances or temporal evolution of conservatively managed patients. We thus report on the long-term radiological and clinical follow-up of two patients with asymptomatic muslin-induced foreign body granulomas after wrapping of recurrent middle cerebral arterial aneurysms. Both patients were successfully managed conservatively and remain asymptomatic three and six years after diagnosis of their granulomas. A literature review confirms that MRI features of muslin-induced foreign body granuloma are typical. Features include focal areas of elevated T2 signal with increased diffusion-weighted signal and thin rim enhancement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to confirm that there is a corresponding reduction in apparent diffusion coefficient, as typical in an intracranial abscess. Thus a history of aneurysm wrapping is critical for diagnosis. Accurate clinical recognition of this exuberant inflammatory response will avoid misdiagnosis as pyogenic abscess or tumor and prevent unnecessary or invasive treatment.
