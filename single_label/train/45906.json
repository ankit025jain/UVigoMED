{"id":45906,"title":"Stercoral perforation in a child: a rare complication of NSAID use.","abstract":"The adverse effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are well known. However, NSAID use rarely leads to a stercoral perforation, an extremely rare but life-threatening cause of acute abdomen. We present a case of stercoral sigmoid colon perforation in a 2-year-old girl, secondary to unintentional NSAID overdose, developing as a result of miscommunication between the general practitioner (GP) and the mother. To the best of our knowledge, stercoral perforation has never before been reported in a child.
