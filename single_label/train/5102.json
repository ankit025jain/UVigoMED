{"id":5102,"title":"Mortality, survival and residual injury burden of Royal Navy and Royal Marine combat casualties sustained in 11-years of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.","abstract":"We present eleven years of prospectively-gathered data defining the full spectrum of the United Kingdom's (UK) Naval Service (Royal Navy and Royal Marines) casualties, and characterise the injury patterns, recovery and residual functional burden from the conflicts of the last decade. The UK Military Trauma Registry was searched for all Naval Service personnel injured between March 2003 and April 2013. These records were then cross-referenced with the records of the Naval Service Medical Board of Survey (NSMBOS), which evaluates injured Naval Service personnel for medical discharge, continued service in a reduced capacity or Return to Full Duty (RTD). Population at risk data was calculated from service records. There were 277 casualties in the study period: 63 (23%) of these were fatalities. Of the 214 survivors, 63 or 29% (23% of total) were medically discharged; 24 or 11% (9% of total) were placed in a reduced fitness category with medical restrictions placed on their continued military service. A total of 127 individuals (46% of the total and 59% of survivors) RTD without any restriction. The greatest number of casualties was sustained in 2007. There was a 3% casualty risk per year of operational service for Naval Service personnel. The most common reason cited by Naval Service Medical Board of Survey (NSMBOS) for medical downgrading or discharge was injury to the lower limb, with upper limb trauma the next most frequent. This study characterises the spectrum of injuries sustained by the Naval Service during recent conflicts with a very high rate of follow-up. Extremity injuries pose the biggest challenge to reconstructive and rehabilitative services striving to maximise the functional outcomes of injured service personnel.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335311","annotations":[{"name":"Royal Marines","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines"},{"name":"Afghanistan","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan"},{"name":"Royal Navy","weight":0.809068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy"},{"name":"Iraq","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq"},{"name":"United States Marine Corps","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps"},{"name":"British Armed Forces","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Armed_Forces"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.664145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Armed forces","weight":0.605897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_forces"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Iraq War","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War"},{"name":"Soldier","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.437486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"United States Navy","weight":0.417884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy"},{"name":"Naval Service (United Kingdom)","weight":0.412041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Service_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Navy","weight":0.411544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy"},{"name":"Combat","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat"},{"name":"Casualty (person)","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_(person)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.14807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Military service","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"International Criminal Court","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Duty","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Retirement","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement"}]}
