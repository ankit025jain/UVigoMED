{"id":68415,"title":"[Value of combined detection of urinary Livin and Survivin mRNA expression in the early diagnosis of bladder cancer].","abstract":"To evaluate the value of urine Livin and Survivin mRNA expression in the early diagnosis of bladder cancer.Fifty-two cases of early bladder cancer and 30 cases of non-urinary system tumors were selected for the combined detection of urinary Livin and Survivin and urine cytology.Livin and Survivin in urine and urinary cytology sensitivity were 71.2% (37/52) , 67.3% (35/52), 23.1% (12/52); Specificity were 96.7% (29/30) , 93.3% (28/30) and 96.7% (29/30) respectively. Urine Survivin sensitivity, specificity compared with Livin were no significant difference (all P > 0.05). Urinary Livin and Survivin were more sensitive than urine cytology, and the differences were statistically significant(all P < 0.05).The combined urinary detection of Livin, Survivin mRNA expression is a noninvasive early diagnosis of bladder cancer with sensitivity and specificity.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521893","annotations":[{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.849703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.795287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.370748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
