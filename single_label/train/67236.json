{"id":67236,"title":"Successful use of dapsone for the management of circinate balanitis.","abstract":"Circinate balanitis is the commonest cutaneous manifestation of reactive arthritis (Reiter syndrome), but can also occur independently. Topical corticosteroid therapy is the most commonly used treatment, and topical calcineurin inhibitors have also been used successfully. We report a case of a 20-year-old man who presented with discrete erythematous patches with slightly raised keratotic annular borders on his glans penis. He also developed geographic tongue and severe arthritis. A clinical diagnosis of circinate balanitis was made, which was supported by the psoriasiform features on skin biopsy. The patient failed to respond to topical 0.05% clobetasol propionate cream, but a novel approach using a combination of dapsone and topical 0.1% tacrolimus ointment successfully cleared his rash.
