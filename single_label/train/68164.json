{"id":68164,"title":"Lifestyle modification is associated with improving estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria in Japanese with proteinuria.","abstract":"The link between lifestyle modification and changes in both proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) was evaluated in Japanese subjects with proteinuria who were not taking medications. We used data from 51 men (35.8±10.0 years) and 74 women (38.0±11.0 years) with proteinuria at baseline and a 1-year follow up. eGFR was defined by a new equation developed specifically for Japanese subjects. Subjects were given advice for dietary and lifestyle improvement at the initial appointment. At the 1-year follow up, eGFR was increased in both sexes, but not at significant levels. (men:p?0.7709, women:p?0.2180). Proteinuria was also improved in many subjects. A decrease in proteinuria may be associated with improving eGFR in Japanese.
