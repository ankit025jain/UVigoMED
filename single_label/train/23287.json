{"id":23287,"title":"Multiple mycotic aneurysms infected with Haemophilus influenzae.","abstract":"Mycotic aneurysms are a relatively uncommon phenomenon that can pose a distinct treatment dilemma for the treating surgeon. It is rare to find Haemophilus influenzae as the causative organism, and it is even more rare to find multiple aneurysms in the same patient. We present the first case to our knowledge to be described in the literature of multiple mycotic aneurysms caused by H. influenzae. The treatment presented-using high-dose antibiotics and cryopreserved homografts-has worked well in this instance. This approach is supported in the literature.
