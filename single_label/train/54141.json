{"id":54141,"title":"Variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma: association with histopathological prognostic factors.","abstract":"Papillary carcinoma is the most common thyroid malignancy. Many variants of this tumor have been described, with different morphological and molecular characteristics. Although most cases have excellent prognosis, the relationship between tumor architecture and its biological behavior remains controversial.To present the experience of a single center on the prevalence of thyroid papillary carcinoma variants and their relationship with other histopathological prognostic factors.Retrospective study of all the cases submitted to thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma in the same institution over 11 years.We included 517 patients, 81.9% of them were women. The average age was 47.2 years. The variants recognized to have higher aggressiveness potential corresponded to 5.6% of the sample. We found an association of tumor subtypes with greater lesion diameter, T staging, lymphovascular and gland capsule invasion.A small percentage of papillary carcinoma cases is represented by variants recognized by their greater potential for aggression. There are associations between these variants and several other histopathological factors already recognized for their prognostic value, which may, by themselves, influence the outcome of these cases.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474487","annotations":[{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.644114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.616083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.597067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.59084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.573635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.417227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.365351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.222222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.148912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.113889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"2003 invasion of Iraq","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Match fixing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_fixing"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Renal papilla","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_papilla"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
