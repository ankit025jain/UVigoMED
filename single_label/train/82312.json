{"id":82312,"title":"Do dentists have better oral health compared to general population: a study on oral health status and oral health behavior in Kathmandu, Nepal.","abstract":"Dentists are considered role models by the general population in regards to oral hygiene and oral health behavior. This study aimed to access the oral health status of dentists and laypersons, and compare the dentists' practice of preventive dentistry and oral self-care behaviors to that of the laypersons.This cross-sectional study recruited 472 participants (195 dentists and 277 laypersons from the general population). Their oral health/hygiene behavior was assessed using a standardized close-ended multiple choice questionnaire. Oral examination was performed to assess caries using Decayed Missed Filled teeth (DMFT) index and periodontal status using Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs (CPITN).Ninety-six percent of dentists brushed their teeth at least once daily, using fluoridated toothpaste and 80.5% twice daily. Although 94% of laypersons brushed their teeth once daily, they seldom used fluoridated toothpaste. Ten percent of participants in each group were caries free. The mean number of teeth present in the oral cavity (27.4 versus 25.4), mean number of teeth with caries (1.8 versus 3.7) and fillings (2.5 versus 0.4) were significantly different (p?<?0.0001) between dentists and laypersons, respectively. Regarding the periodontal status, 82% of dentists had CPITN score of 0 whereas 71% of laypersons had the highest score 3 (p?=?0.007), and 81% of the laypersons reported tooth mobility compared to 1% of dentists (p?<?0.0001).The participating dentists had better periodontal status and better self-reported oral health behaviors than the laypersons. Despite similar prevalence of caries in the two groups, the prevalence of decayed and unfilled teeth was lower among the dentists.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655533","annotations":[{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.815511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.76378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.729197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Water fluoridation","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.673588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.481623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.417362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.414288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Nepal","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Decomposition","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Kathmandu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu"},{"name":"Deposition (law)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(law)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"277","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/277"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Brushed metal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushed_metal"},{"name":"Role Models","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_Models"},{"name":"Multiple choice","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_choice"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Network Ten","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Ten"},{"name":"Laity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laity"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
