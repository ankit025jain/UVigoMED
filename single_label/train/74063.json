{"id":74063,"title":"A phase II study of metronomic paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide/capecitabine followed by 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide as preoperative chemotherapy for triple-negative or low hormone receptor expressing/HER2-negative primary breast cancer.","abstract":"Better treatments for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are needed. To address this need, we studied the effects of preoperative metronomic paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide/capecitabine (mPCX) followed by 5-fluorouracil (FU)/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) as preoperative chemotherapy in TNBC patients.Forty primary TNBC patients received four cycles of metronomic paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) on Days 1, 8, and 15), cyclophosphamide (50 mg/body daily), and capecitabine (1,200 mg/m(2) daily), followed by four cycles of 5-FU (500 mg/m(2)), epirubicin (100 mg/m(2)), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks. The primary end point was the pathological complete response (pCR) rate.Forty patients formed the intent-to-treat population. The median dose intensities of paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, and capecitabine were 89.7, 92.1, and 89.8%, respectively. Five patients discontinued mPCX and two discontinued FEC, primarily because of adverse events, resulting in a per-protocol population (PPS) of 33 patients. The pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) rate was 47.5% (19/40) in the intent-to-treat population and 54.5% (18/33) in the PPS. The clinical response rates were 36/40 (90.0%) and 31/33 (93.9%) in the intent-to-treat and PPS, respectively. The breast conservation rate was 72.7% (24/33), and 5/13 patients underwent partial resection instead of pre-planned total mastectomy. Grade 3-4 adverse events included neutropenia (35%), leukopenia (25%), and hand-foot syndrome (8%).Metronomic PCX followed by FEC chemotherapy was associated with a high pCR rate and low toxicity in TNBC patients. Further studies of this regimen in larger numbers of patients are warranted.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871032","annotations":[{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Epirubicin","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epirubicin"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Capecitabine","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capecitabine"},{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.788103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.764484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Radical mastectomy","weight":0.755469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_mastectomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.635207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.626514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hormone receptor","weight":0.593168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_receptor"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.469896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Conserved sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
