{"id":690,"title":"[Development of molecular PCR-RFLP test for identification of the epidemic strain of Y. enterocolitica bioserotype 1B/O8 circulating in Poland since 2004].","abstract":"Highly pathogenic Y. enterocolitica bioserotype 1B/O8 is considered to be an important etiological agent of yersiniosis in Poland. Infections caused by Y. enterocolitica 1B/O8 became an important public health problem in Poland, especially because of their high potential of virulence and the unknown source of the bacteria. Y. enterocolitica 1B/O8 isolates recovered in Poland are genetically highly related and constitute single epidemic sensu stricto strain. The aim of the present study was to develop a time- and money-effective molecular assay for rapid identification of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica 1B/O8 isolates belonging to the epidemic strain.In the first stage we performed a multiplex-PCR for four genetic markers: ail, ystA, irp1 and 16S rDNA sequence. In the next stage we designed a duplex-PCR-RFLP assay with BtsI endonuclease to detect/identify specific variant of an ysrR gene that is characteristic for epidemic strain of Y. enterocolitica 1B/O8 strain. The assay was tested against a panel of a consisted of a variety Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis strains.All the tested Y. enterocolitica 1B/O8 strains were positive for all the genetic markers in multiplex-PCR assay what distinguished them from other tested Yersinia strains. In duplex-PCR-RFLP test all tested isolates of the epidemic strain were negative for ysrR digestion with BtsI endonuclease, while all tested reference strains of Y. enterocolitica 1B/O8 were positive.The assay developed in this study was two-stage/two-step molecular test efficiently distinguishing wild-type and the epidemic Y. enterocolitica 1B/O8 strain. Such test can be a useful screening tool for clinical, veterinary and food diagnostics, as well as for the purposes of epidemiological investigation.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25369655","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.818239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.805036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.770151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.706287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.496646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.483971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"16S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.475919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.359708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.300165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.27036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.224121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.221231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Yersinia enterocolitica","weight":0.10897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_enterocolitica"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Yersinia","weight":0.0328325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia"},{"name":"Endonuclease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endonuclease"},{"name":"Yersinia pseudotuberculosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_pseudotuberculosis"},{"name":"Sensu","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensu"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Body odor","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_odor"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Ribosomal DNA","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_DNA"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Public sector","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector"}]}
