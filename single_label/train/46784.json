{"id":46784,"title":"Bear bile powder (???) induces apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells via mitochondrion-dependent pathway.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of Bear Bile Powder(, BBP) on the growth and apoptosis of HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and investigate the possible molecular mechanisms mediating its anti-cancer activity.HepG2 cells were treated with 0.4-1.0 mg/mL of BBP for 24, 48 and 72 h. The viability of HePG2 cells was determined by MTT assay. Cellular morphology was observed via phase-contrast microscopy. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with Annexin-V/propidium idodide and 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethyl-benzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) staining was performed to determine cell apoptosis and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, respectively. Activation of caspase-9 and -3 was evaluated by a colorimetric assay.The treatment with 0.4-1 mg/mL of BBP for 24, 48, or 72 h respectively reduced cell viability significantly by 7%-60%, 20%-90% or 25%-98%, compared with the untreated control cells (P<0.01). In addition, BBP treatment induced morphological changes in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, after treated with 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 mg/mL of BBP, apoptosis cells (including early and late apoptotic cells) were 18.0%±1.3%, 34.9%±2.2%, 33.9%±2.8%, 37.4%±2.8% and 46.0%±2.5%, respectively (P<0.05); and the percentage of cells with reduced JC-1 red fluorescence were 6.6%±0.8%, 8.5%±0.8%, 13.5%±1.6%, 17.6%±2.3% and 46.7%±3.6%, respectively (P<0.01). Finally, BBP treatment significantly and dose-dependently induced activation of both caspase-9 and caspase-3 in HepG2 cells (P<0.05).BBP could inhibit the growth of HepG2 hepatocellular cancer cells through mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis, which may, in part, explain its anti-cancer activity. BBP may be a potential novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619237","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.660403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.625048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.580135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.518766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.503494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.497336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.47851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.346332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.332785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.22073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.103608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0320572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Iodide","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodide"},{"name":"Colorimetry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetry"},{"name":"Bile bear","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_bear"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Powder (substance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(substance)"},{"name":"Wine color","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_color"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Bear","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear"},{"name":"Assortative mating","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assortative_mating"}]}
