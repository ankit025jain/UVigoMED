{"id":56873,"title":"Retinal cell death and current strategies in retinal neuroprotection.","abstract":"Retinal cell death is the main cause of vision loss in many blinding conditions. Research on the basics of how and why retinal cells die in different diseases provides insights into the development of treatment strategies to prevent or reverse this loss. This review summarizes the literature published on this topic in the last year.Apoptosis is generally considered the main pathway by which retinal cells die in response to a range of noxious stimuli. However, inhibiting apoptosis does not completely prevent retinal cell death, as many enter programmed necrosis or necroptosis. Many novel ways of inhibiting apoptosis and necrosis, including blockage of the Fas receptor, neuroprotective peptides and antioxidants, continue to be investigated. Also, additional pathways including autophagy and inflammation are being examined on how they contribute to the loss of retinal cells in different disease models.With more knowledge of how retinal cells die, further advances are being made in prolonging the cell survival. However, even as basic science discoveries remain promising, clinical utility of neuroprotection is still quite limited at this time.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614145","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.783461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.630696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.512631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Fas receptor","weight":0.465219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fas_receptor"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.397865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.380891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.36104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.289775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Vision loss","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.122128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.112383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Fas ligand","weight":0.0745223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fas_ligand"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
