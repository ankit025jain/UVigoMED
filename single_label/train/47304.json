{"id":47304,"title":"[Limitations of surgery for rectal cancer].","abstract":"This article presents and summarizes different treatment options for rectal cancer. The aim of this article is an historical review of treating primary and recurrent rectal cancer, highlighting the development and advancement in surgical and multimodal therapy. Limitations, specifically regarding recurrent rectal cancer are discussed and reviewed. A R0 resection can almost always be achieved in primary rectal cancer. In recurrent rectal cancer a R0 resection with extended surgical resection can be achieved in up to 70?% of the cases. In addition, surgical therapy plays a crucial role in the case of metastatic disease but should be incorporated into a multimodal network. The analysis of tumor genetics and predictive parameters will lead to the emergence of new treatment concepts shifting the limits of the current gold standard. Oncological long-term survival and improving the quality of life are the main focal points.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595476","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.825549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.649408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.646414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.347891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.229492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Multimodal therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_therapy"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Incorporation (business)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(business)"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Social network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"},{"name":"Focus (optics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(optics)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"}]}
