{"id":92648,"title":"The risk of radiation-induced breast cancers due to biennial mammographic screening in women aged 50-69 years is minimal.","abstract":"The main aim of mammographic screening is to reduce the mortality from breast cancer. However, use of ionizing radiation is considered a potential harm due to the possible risk of inducing cancer in healthy women.To estimate the potential number of radiation-induced breast cancers, radiation-induced breast cancer deaths, and lives saved due to implementation of organized mammographic screening as performed in Norway.We used a previously published excess absolute risk model which assumes a linear no-threshold dose-response. The estimates were calculated for 100,000 women aged 50-69 years, a screening interval of 2 years, and with an assumed follow-up until the age of 85 or 105 years. Radiation doses of 0.7, 2.5, and 5.7 mGy per screening examination, a latency time of 5 or 10 years, and a dose and dose-rate effectiveness factor (DDREF) of 1 or 2 were applied.The total lifetime risk of radiation-induced breast cancers per 100,000 women was 10 (95% CI: 4-25) if the women were followed from the ages of 50 to 85 years, for a dose of 2.5 mGy, a latency time of 10 years, and a DDREF of 1. For the same parameter values the number of radiation-induced breast cancer death was 1 (95% CI: 0-2). The assumed number of lives saved is approximately 350.The risk of radiation-induced breast cancer and breast cancer death due to mammographic screening is minimal. Women should not be discouraged from attending screening due to fear of radiation-induced breast cancer death.","date":"2014-11-15","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24311702","annotations":[{"name":"Ionizing radiation","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.811614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.719283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.608482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.599981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.505003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Norway","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.159122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"350","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Absolute monarchy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 425","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_425"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biennial plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biennial_plant"},{"name":"Minimalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Risk modeling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_modeling"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Absolute risk reduction","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_risk_reduction"},{"name":"Latency (engineering)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"}]}
