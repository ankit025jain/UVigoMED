{"id":81940,"title":"Munchmeyer's disease-a rare case report and review of literature.","abstract":"Munchmeyer's disease is a rare variety of myositis ossificans. It is a significant clinical entity, diagnosing and understanding its pathophysiology can save a patient from spurious medical workups and anxiety of a suspected neoplasm. The number of authentic cases of this disease in the literature is small. The purpose of this article is to present a case of Munchmeyer's disease and review the literature for the same to date. The rare incidence, obscure aetiology, unknown definitive treatment plan and poor prognosis make this condition an enigma.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773627","annotations":[{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.588529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.208106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Myositis ossificans","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myositis_ossificans"},{"name":"Myositis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myositis"},{"name":"Paradox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Save (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Legitimacy (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(law)"}]}
