{"id":78834,"title":"Auditory risk estimates for youth target shooting.","abstract":"To characterize the impulse noise exposure and auditory risk for youth recreational firearm users engaged in outdoor target shooting events. The youth shooting positions are typically standing or sitting at a table, which places the firearm closer to the ground or reflective surface when compared to adult shooters.Acoustic characteristics were examined and the auditory risk estimates were evaluated using contemporary damage-risk criteria for unprotected adult listeners and the 120-dB peak limit suggested by the World Health Organization (1999) for children.Impulses were generated by 26 firearm/ammunition configurations representing rifles, shotguns, and pistols used by youth. Measurements were obtained relative to a youth shooter's left ear.All firearms generated peak levels that exceeded the 120 dB peak limit suggested by the WHO for children. In general, shooting from the seated position over a tabletop increases the peak levels, LAeq8 and reduces the unprotected maximum permissible exposures (MPEs) for both rifles and pistols. Pistols pose the greatest auditory risk when fired over a tabletop.Youth should utilize smaller caliber weapons, preferably from the standing position, and always wear hearing protection whenever engaging in shooting activities to reduce the risk for auditory damage.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564688","annotations":[{"name":"Firearm","weight":0.793471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.56717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Rifle","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.414465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Caliber","weight":0.373874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliber"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Shotgun","weight":0.188801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun"},{"name":"Shooting sport","weight":0.149224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_sport"},{"name":"Handgun","weight":0.115375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun"},{"name":"Weapon","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0902121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Impulse noise (audio)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_noise_(audio)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"ISSF shooting events","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISSF_shooting_events"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Reflection (physics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)"},{"name":"Shooting","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"List of pistols","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pistols"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Retroreflector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroreflector"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Tabletop game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_game"},{"name":"Standing position","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_position"},{"name":"Closer (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)"},{"name":"Earplug","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earplug"},{"name":"Furniture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Impulse (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_(physics)"}]}
