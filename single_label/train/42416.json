{"id":42416,"title":"Management of a ruptured mucinous mesenteric cyst with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.","abstract":"Mesenteric cysts are rare intra-abdominal cysts that are generally regarded as benign, and the incidence of malignancy is often cited to be 3%. The typical recommendation for treatment is complete excision to minimize recurrence. Excision can be performed laparoscopically, but this can lead to intra-abdominal dissemination of the cyst contents. There has been one case report describing the development of pseudomyxoma peritonei following rupture of a mesenteric cyst. We describe the treatment and outcome of a patient who underwent cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for the treatment of an incompletely resected mucinous cystadenocarcinoma originating from the colonic mesentery.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852878","annotations":[{"name":"Pseudomyxoma peritonei","weight":0.817307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomyxoma_peritonei"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.80082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.665493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.628691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.510706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.457962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.405277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Cystadenocarcinoma","weight":0.305976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystadenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.207942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
