{"id":78010,"title":"Knowledge, experience and practice of SLTs regarding (re)habilitation in deaf children with cochlear implants.","abstract":"To assess the knowledge, experience and practices of speech and language therapists (SLTs) in Greece regarding children with cochlear implants.A special designed questionnaire was originally completed electronically by 313 SLTs via surveymonkey platform.From the 313 respondents 35% had worked with implanted children, 37% received course training and 44% had participated in post-graduate seminars. Although 96% believe that there are differences in the management of these children, almost 47% of the participants did not have adequate knowledge on the candidacy criteria for implantation and 70% regarding the available technology for implanted children. Knowledge and skills on CI were better for those SLTs who worked with hearing-impairment. Diverse practice models were noted. Interestingly, more than 87% of the participants advocated toward further training and supervision in the field, even the ones who had less than extensive knowledge in working with CI. As for practice, a lack of organizational interdisciplinary structure became evident.There is a growing need for well organized professional training and team networks for SLTs in order for them to further improve their knowledge and service delivery to implanted children.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814237","annotations":[{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Greece","weight":0.712948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"},{"name":"Speech and language pathology","weight":0.69026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_and_language_pathology"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.660471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.529777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.514247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.499321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.368822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Postgraduate education","weight":0.302019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.246946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.155599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Professional development","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_development"},{"name":"Seminar","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminar"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"313","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/313"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Diverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverse"},{"name":"Computing platform","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
