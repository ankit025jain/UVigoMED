{"id":10498,"title":"Female spontaneously hypertensive rats are more dependent on ANG (1-7) to mediate effects of low-dose AT1 receptor blockade than males.","abstract":"ANG (1-7) contributes to the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in male experimental animals. Females have greater ANG (1-7) concentrations than males; however, the contribution of ANG (1-7) to ARB-mediated decreases in BP in females is unknown. The current study tested the hypothesis that female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) have a larger ANG (1-7) contribution to the BP-lowering effects of the ARB candesartan than male SHR. Twelve-week-old male and female SHR were randomized to receive candesartan (0.5 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1); 7 days), candesartan plus ANG II (200 ng·kg(-1)·min(-1); 7 days), the ANG (1-7) antagonist A-779 (48 ?g·kg(-1)·h(-1)) plus candesartan and ANG II. Candesartan decreased basal BP in males and females (baseline vs. candesartan: 142 ± 2 vs. 122 ± 3 and 129 ± 1 vs. 115 ± 1 mmHg, respectively; P < 0.05); however, the decrease was greater in males. ANG II increased BP in males in the presence of candesartan (149 ± 2 mmHg; P < 0.05); candesartan blocked ANG II-induced increases in BP in females (116 ± 1 mmHg). Pretreatment with A-779 abolished candesartan-mediated decreases in BP in females, but not males. A-779 also exacerbated ANG II-induced proteinuria (26 ± 6 vs. 77 ± 11 ?g·kg(-1)·day(-1), respectively; P < 0.05) and nephrinuria (20 ± 5 vs. 202 ± 58 ?g·kg(-1)·day(-1), respectively; P < 0.05) in candesartan-treated female SHR, with no effect in males. In conclusion, females are more sensitive to the BP-lowering effect of ARBs during ANG II infusion, whereas males are more sensitive under basal conditions. In addition, ANG (1-7) has a greater contribution to ARB-mediated decreases in BP, protein, and nephrin excretion in females relative to males.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647710","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.74922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.467277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Angiotensin II receptor antagonist","weight":0.368576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II_receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.338413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Candesartan","weight":0.328079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candesartan"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Angiotensin receptor","weight":0.176993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_receptor"},{"name":"Angiotensin II receptor type 1","weight":0.159466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II_receptor_type_1"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.106224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.0362083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Nephrin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrin"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"779","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/779"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Blocking (American football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(American_football)"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"SHR (operating system)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHR_(operating_system)"},{"name":"Austria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Blockade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade"}]}
