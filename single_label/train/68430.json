{"id":68430,"title":"Variability of oxidative stress biomarkers in hemodialysis patients.","abstract":"Oxidative stress biomarkers may have a role in the future to assist clinical decisions regarding the use of antioxidant therapies and their efficacy. The aims of this study were to evaluate the within and between-individual variability of plasma oxidative stress biomarkers and investigate factors affecting their variability. Plasma F2-isoprostanes and protein carbonyls were measured in 14 hemodialysis patients every 2 weeks for 10 weeks. Within-individual coefficients of variation (CVs) were isoprostanes?=?30.4% (range?=?6.1-66.7%) and protein carbonyls?=?16.3% (8.4-29.5%). Between-individual CVs were isoprostanes?=?34.4% (28.9-40.2%) and protein carbonyls?=?19.5% (15.6-24.5%). There were no significant (p?>?0.05) relationships between the oxidative stress biomarkers and dietary antioxidant intake, medications, clinical and demographic parameters.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520971","annotations":[{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.82223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.751003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.599309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.587655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.464585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.405091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.200049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Carbonyl","weight":0.0430597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonyl"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Coefficient of variation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"624","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/624"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Curriculum vitae","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae"}]}
