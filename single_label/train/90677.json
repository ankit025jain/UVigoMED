{"id":90677,"title":"Clinical outcomes of medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction in patients with an increased tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove distance.","abstract":"Medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction is performed to treat recurrent patellar dislocation (RPD). However, the effectiveness of MPFL reconstruction in patients with a severely lateralised tibial tuberosity remains unknown. In this study, the clinical outcomes of MPFL reconstruction in patients with an increased tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance were examined.A total of thirty-four patients who underwent MPFL reconstruction for RPD were retrospectively examined. Nineteen patients with a TT-TG distance of >20 mm (increased TT-TG distance group) were compared with 15 patients with a TT-TG distance of <20 mm (control group). Clinical outcomes of MPFL reconstruction were evaluated by occurrence of re-dislocation, Crosby and Insall grading system, apprehension sign, and Kujala and Lysholm scores.None of the patients reported re-dislocation. Apprehension sign remained in three patients in the increased TT-TG distance group and in one patient in the control group. According to the Crosby and Insall grading system, 9 patients (47%) were excellent, 9 (47%) were good, and 1 (5%) was fair to poor in the increased TT-TG distance group, while 6 (40%) were excellent and 9 (60%) were good in the control group. Kujala and Lysholm scores were significantly improved post-operatively in both groups. No significant correlations were observed between TT-TG distance and post-operative Kujala or Lysholm score.Overall clinical outcomes of MPFL reconstruction were favourable even in patients with an increased TT-TG distance. TT-TG distance of >20 mm may not be an absolute indication for medialisation of the tibial tuberosity when performing MPFL reconstruction.Case-control study, Level III.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584694","annotations":[{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.312913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Tubercle (anatomy)","weight":0.137589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubercle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0831872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Tuberosity of the tibia","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberosity_of_the_tibia"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.0372292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"RPD","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPD"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"20 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Twin-screw type supercharger","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-screw_type_supercharger"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Groove (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_(music)"}]}
