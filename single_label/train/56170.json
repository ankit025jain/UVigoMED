{"id":56170,"title":"Quantitative analysis of macular contraction in idiopathic epiretinal membrane.","abstract":"We aimed to quantify the displacement of macular capillaries using infrared fundus photographs and image processing software (ImageJ) in patients with idiopathic epiretinal membrane (ERM) who have undergone vitrectomy and to analyze the correlation between vessel displacement and retinal thickness.This prospective study included 16 patients who underwent vitrectomy for idiopathic ERM. Ophthalmic examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed before and 3 months after surgery. The length of radial vessel segment included in each area (VLA) and the length from the foveola to the vessel branching point (FBL) depending on the superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal areas of the macula were measured using infrared fundus images and image processing software (ImageJ). Preoperative and postoperative parameters were compared and correlations between VLA, FBL, macular thickness, and visual acuity were assessed.The VLA of superior, inferior, and temporal areas showed a significant postoperative reduction. VLA differences showed a positive correlation with differences in macular thickness, which corresponded to the superior, inferior, and temporal areas; however, no correlation was observed in the nasal area. The FBL of the superior and inferior areas was significantly increased postoperatively. A positive correlation was observed between FBL differences and macular thickness differences in the superior area. Postoperative change in VLA and FBL did not show a significant correlation with postoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and BCVA differences.Infrared fundus photographs and image processing software can be useful for quantifying progressive changes in retinal surface distortion after surgical removal of ERM. Macular edema and vascular distortion showed significant improvement after surgery. Furthermore, a correlation was observed between topographic and tomographic changes.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735324","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.798873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.747118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Macula of retina","weight":0.728218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula_of_retina"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.56741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.546985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Image processing","weight":0.442177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.403002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.392566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.386088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.384824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.127125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Distortion","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0734405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"ImageJ","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageJ"},{"name":"Epiretinal membrane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiretinal_membrane"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Very Large Array","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Array"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
