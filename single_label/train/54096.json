{"id":54096,"title":"[Diabetes in general practice--were treatment goals reached?].","abstract":"In Norway, most people with diabetes are treated by general practitioners. At our own general practice, we wanted to find out whether we were succeeding in following the Directorate of Health's 2009 clinical guidelines on treatment and management of diabetes.All patients with the diagnosis diabetes mellitus in our electronic archive between November 2009 and October 2010 were registered. Those patients on our general practice lists in October 2010 were identified. The patient records were manually reviewed and relevant data recorded.In all, 271 patients with diabetes attended our surgery for check-ups in October 2010. 11% had type 1 diabetes and 88% had type 2 diabetes. HbA1c was measured in 99% of the diabetes patients, blood pressure in 98% and lipids in 93%. The measurements were taken at our surgery during the past year for 96% of the patients. The treatment goals for HbA1c, systolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol were reached in, respectively, 55%, 55% and 49% of the patients. 13% reached all three treatment goals. 82% had a check-up with an ophthalmologist. Weight and smoking habits were documented in 85% and 90% respectively. 19% of the patients for whom we had documented data, smoked. Examinations of height, feet and microalbumin were documented in 57%, 35% and 28% of the patients respectively.The guidelines are being followed on most points to a high degree, and the proportion of patients reaching the stricter treatment goals is consistent with the results of earlier Norwegian surveys. There is the potential for further improvement of these results.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477150","annotations":[{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.815539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.774928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Norway","weight":0.686871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.596813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.376722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.0633088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Smoking (cooking)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"General medical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_medical_examination"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
