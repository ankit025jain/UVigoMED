{"id":88740,"title":"Checkrein deformity due to extensor hallucis longus hypotrophy treated with extensor digitorum longus tendon transfer.","abstract":"Checkrein deformity is a relatively rare condition caused by hypotrophy or adhesion of a tendon after a lower leg injury. The occurrence of this condition due to the dysfunction of the extensor hallucis longus (EHL) is extremely rare. Only a few related case reports have been published, and Z-lengthening of the EHL tendon was performed for almost all patients. We report a case of checkrein deformity due to EHL hypotrophy. The patient was involved in a traffic accident 7 years ago. He sustained left tibial and fibular closed diaphyseal fractures and underwent minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis. He continued to have left great toe symptoms characterized by dorsiflexion of the great toe during ankle plantarflexion. The EHL had become an insufficient power source because of considerable hypotrophy. Therefore, a tendon transfer using the extensor digitorum longus to the second toe was performed as a primary treatment.
