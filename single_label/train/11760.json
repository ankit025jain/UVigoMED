{"id":11760,"title":"Yeast virus-derived stimulator of the innate immune system augments the efficacy of virus vector-based immunotherapy.","abstract":"To identify novel stimulators of the innate immune system, we constructed a panel of eight HEK293 cell lines double positive for human Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and an NF-?B-inducible reporter gene. Screening of a large variety of compounds and cellular extracts detected a TLR3-activating compound in a microsomal yeast extract. Fractionation of this extract identified an RNA molecule of 4.6 kb, named nucleic acid band 2 (NAB2), that was sufficient to confer the activation of TLR3. Digests with single- and double-strand-specific RNases showed the double-strand nature of this RNA, and its sequence was found to be identical to that of the genome of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) L-BC virus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A large-scale process of production and purification of this RNA was established on the basis of chemical cell lysis and dsRNA-specific chromatography. NAB2 complexed with the cationic lipid Lipofectin but neither NAB2 nor Lipofectin alone induced the secretion of interleukin-12(p70) [IL-12(p70)], alpha interferon, gamma interferon-induced protein 10, macrophage inflammatory protein 1?, or IL-6 in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. While NAB2 activated TLR3, Lipofectin-stabilized NAB2 also signaled via the cytoplasmic sensor for RNA recognition MDA-5. A significant increase of RMA-MUC1 tumor rejection and survival was observed in C57BL/6 mice after prophylactic vaccination with MUC1-encoding modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and NAB2-Lipofectin. This combination of immunotherapies strongly increased at the injection sites the percentage of infiltrating natural killer (NK) cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), cell types which can modulate innate and adaptive immune responses.Virus-based cancer vaccines offer a good alternative to the treatment of cancer but could be improved. Starting from a screening approach, we have identified and characterized an unexplored biological molecule with immunomodulatory characteristics which augments the efficacy of an MVA-based immunotherapeutic agent. The immune modulator consists of the purified dsRNA genome isolated from a commercially used yeast strain, NAB2, mixed with a cationic lipid, Lipofectin. NAB2-Lipofectin stimulates the immune system via TLR3 and MDA-5. When it was injected at the MVA vaccination site, the immune modulator increased survival in a preclinical tumor model. We could demonstrate that NAB2-Lipofectin augments the MVA-induced infiltration of natural killer and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We suggest indirect mechanisms of activation of these cell types by the influence of NAB2-Lipofectin on innate and adaptive immunity. Detailed analysis of cell migration at the vaccine injection site and the appropriate choice of an immune modulator should be considered to achieve the rational improvement of virus vector-based vaccination by immune modulators.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Animal
