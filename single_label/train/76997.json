{"id":76997,"title":"Association between oxidative stress index and serum lipid levels in healthy young adults.","abstract":"To investigate the relationship between lipid levels and oxidative stress index in healthy young adults.The study was camed out at the Department of Emergency Service, Faculty of Medicine, Cumhuriyet University, Sivas, Turkey, between January 2011 and July 2012. A total of 100 healthy adult volunteers were enrolled in the study. Venous blood samples (10 ml) were collected from all individuals, and serum lipid parameters, total antioxidant capacity and total oxidative levels were studied. SPSS 15 was used for statistical analysis.Overall, there were 84 (84%) males and 16 (16%) females. The mean age fo the male population was 30 +/- 3 years, while that of the females was 31 +/- 3 years. Overall age ranged from 25 to 35 years. A statistically significant correlation was found between the oxidative stress index and serum cholesterol (p < 0.001; r = 0.596), triglyceride (p < 0.001; r = 0.476) and low-density lipoprotein levels (p < 0.001; r = 0.318). However, no significant correlation was found between oxidative stress index and serum high-density lipoprotein levels (p = 0.564; r = 0.058).The results showed that even at an early age, there is a direct linear correlation between oxidative stress and serum lipid levels.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864627","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.79374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.761137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.687287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.586634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.384048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.341649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.249403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.224485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.171124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.097397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Oxygen radical absorbance capacity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_radical_absorbance_capacity"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Faculty (division)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)"}]}
