{"id":78950,"title":"Clinical value of the high expression of corticosteroid receptor-beta mRNA in the nasal mucosa of steroid-resistant patients with allergic rhinitis.","abstract":"This study investigated clinical values of corticosteroid (CS) receptor ? and ? in the nasal mucosa of patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) by determining CS receptor ? and ? mRNA expression following steroid treatment.Among 120 outpatients, 65 had persistent AR, including 36 being sensitive to steroid treatment (steroid-sensitive group) and 29 being resistant to steroid treatment (steroid-resistant group). In addition, 30 patients with deflection of the nasal septum alone, which was corrected by surgery, were recruited as controls. Fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used to quantify CS receptor ? and ? mRNA expression in the nasal mucosa of patients.Results showed that CS receptor ? mRNA expression in the nasal mucosa was significantly higher in the steroid-resistant group [(5.62 ± 1.28) × 102 copies/µg] compared with the steroid-sensitive [(4.62 ± 0.48) × 102 copies/µg, t = -6.67, p < 0.01] and control [(5.32 ± 0.55) × 102 copies/µg, t = -8.29, p < 0.01] groups. There were significant differences in the mRNA expression ratio of CS receptor ? to ? between the steroid-sensitive (658.32 ± 65.16) and steroid-resistant (525.70 ± 68.10) groups (t = 10.16, p < 0.01).A high level of CS receptor ? mRNA but a low level of CS receptor ? mRNA expression in patients with steroid-resistant AR indicates steroid resistance. CS receptor ? plays a role in evaluating the effects of steroid therapy for AR.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525713","annotations":[{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.910198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.777944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.737545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.682648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.574824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.496724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.362103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Nasal septum","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septum"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.309215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.061875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Group 5 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_5_element"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"}]}
