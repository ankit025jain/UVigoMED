{"id":32830,"title":"Comparison of medium-term results of transcatheter correction versus surgical treatment for secundum type atrial septal defect combined with pulmonary valve stenosis.","abstract":"This study was undertaken to compare the clinical results of traditional surgery and a percutaneous procedure for secundum type atrial septal defect (ASD) combined with pulmonary valve stenosis (PS). A total of 78 consecutive patients were identified between March 2004 and July 2012 in our institution. Thirty-five patients (44.9%) underwent percutaneous correction and the remaining 43 patients (55.1%) were treated surgically. All patients had simultaneous complete correction in both groups and no serious complications occurred. The surgical group was significantly younger (13.9 ± 13.0 versus 31.0 ± 17.5 years, P < 0.001) and had a longer mean hospital stay (12.6 ± 4.7 versus 5.3 ± 1.5 days, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in defect size (18.0 ± 7.9 versus 16.9 ± 8.4 mm, P = 0.553) and transvalvular gradient detected by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) (74.7 ± 28.3 versus 87.6 ± 37.8 mmHg, P = 0.089) between the two groups. Significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) decreased from 66% to 14% in the transcatheter group and from 40% to 9% in the surgical group. Mild pulmonary regurgitation was detected in 8 patients in the transcatheter cohort and in 6 patients in the surgical cohort after the procedure. At last follow-up, 83% and 93% of the patients in the transcatheter and surgical groups, respectively, were free of any symptoms, and a significant improvement from preprocedure was observed in the transcatheter group but not in the surgical group (P = 0.005 and P = 0.062). In conclusion, transcatheter correction is a valuable alternative to surgery and allows more patients to be effectively treated in China.
