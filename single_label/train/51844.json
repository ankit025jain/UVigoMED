{"id":51844,"title":"Mitotically active cellular fibroma of the ovary: a case report and a review of the literature.","abstract":"Mitotically active cellular fibroma (MACF) is characterized by increased cellularity, mitotic activity, and less frequently, nuclear atypia, which comprises 10% of ovarian fibromatous tumors. The authors report the case of a 76-year-old woman who presented at the present hospital with a two-month pelvic mass. B ultrasound disclosed a 75 x 52 x 41 mm mass in the right accessories. A hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Histologically, the tumor was composed of a densely cellular proliferation of fibrolastic-like cells with bland nuclear features and arranged in a fascicular pattern. There were more than four mitotic figures per ten high-power fields (HPFs). The histological diagnosis for the mass of the right ovary was MACF. MACF should be distinguished from ovarian fibrosarcoma. MACF is a recent histopathologic entity. Despite the high count of mitotic figures, the clinical course of the tumor is typically uneventful. Long-term clinical follow-up is recommended.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654469","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrosarcoma","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosarcoma"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.844401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pleomorphism","weight":0.714865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphism"},{"name":"Fibroma","weight":0.703731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.370627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.333448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Atypia","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypia"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Symmetry in biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
