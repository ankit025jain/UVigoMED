{"id":69063,"title":"Scrotal wall metastasis as the first manifestation of primary gastric adenocarcinoma.","abstract":"Metastases to the scrotal wall are very rare, and being the initial manifestation of occult primary tumours is even rarer. We report on a patient presenting with painless scrotal swelling, attributed to a solid extra-testicular mass found on ultrasonography. Subsequent investigations and surgical exploration revealed it to be a scrotal wall metastasis from an occult gastric primary. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a scrotal wall metastasis from gastric adenocarcinoma. The ensuing discussion and literature review highlight the diagnostic challenges posed by an extra-testicular scrotal metastasis from an occult primary tumour.
