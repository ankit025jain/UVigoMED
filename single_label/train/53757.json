{"id":53757,"title":"Antidiabetic activity of methanolic extract of Hiptage bengalensis leaves in alloxan induced diabetic models.","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia and its occurrence is increasing fast in most of the countries. Herbal medicine derived from plant extracts have been utilized increasingly for the treatment of various disorders like diabetes mellitus. The present study was designed to evaluate the antidiabetic activity of Methanolic Extract of Hiptage bengalensis L. Kurz (MEHB) in alloxan induced diabetic rats and chick model. Alloxan (120 mg kg-1) was used to induce diabetes in rats and the blood glucose levels were estimated by using commercial kit in the market. The methanolic extract of Hiptage bengalensis was administered to diabetic rats as single dose for one day at a dose of 100 and 200 mg kg-1. The extract produced a significant reduction (p<0.01) of blood glucose levels at a dose of 100 and 200 mg kg-1 in diabetic rats. It also showed a beneficial effect on the lipid profile in alloxan induced diabetic rats. These results showed that methanolic extract of Hiptage bengalensis produced a dose dependant antihyperglycemic activity in rats.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498837","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.847261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.56674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.313525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"Alloxan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloxan"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"}]}
